This README file describes the NUS Corpus of Learner English (NUCLE).
It was collected in a collaboration project between the National
University of Singapore (NUS) Natural Language Processing (NLP) Group
led by Prof. Hwee Tou Ng and the NUS Centre for English Language
Communication (CELC) led by Prof. Siew Mei Wu. The work was carried
out as part of the PhD thesis research of Daniel Dahlmeier at the NUS
NLP Group.

The corpus is distributed under the standard NUS licensing agreement
available when downloading the corpus. Any questions regarding NUCLE
should be directed to Daniel Dahlmeier at: danielhe@comp.nus.edu.sg

1. About
========

NUCLE is a corpus of learner English. It consists of about 1,400
essays written by university students at the National University of
Singapore on a wide range of topics, such as environmental pollution,
healthcare, etc. It contains over one million words which are
completely annotated with error tags and corrections. All annotations
have been performed by professional English instructors at the NUS
CELC.


2. Data Format 
==============

The corpus is distributed in a simple SGML format.  All annotations
come in a "stand-off" format. The start position and end position of
an annotation are given by paragraph and character offsets.
Paragraphs are enclosed in <P>...</P> tags. Paragraphs and characters
are counted starting from zero. Each annotation includes the following
fields: the error type, the correction, and optionally a comment. If
the correction replaces the original text at the given location, it
should fix the grammatical error.

Example:

<DOC nid="840">
<TEXT>
<P>
Engineering design process can be defined as a process ...
</P>
<P>
Firstly, engineering design ...
</P>
...
</TEXT>
<ANNOTATION teacher_id="173">
<MISTAKE start_par="0" start_off="0" end_par="0" end_off="26">
<TYPE>ArtOrDet</TYPE>
<CORRECTION>The engineering design process</CORRECTION>
</MISTAKE>
...

</DOC>
