    Every year, many high school students are enconraged to give aid education in poor areas
in China.They don't complain but just want to let more children to have educatin.
    Aid educatioon is not a new word now.Atlthough our country is becoming more and more    
prosperious,there are still many children in mountain or poor areas cannot get the 
education they deserve .The reason is obvious.First,they don't have enough money.Second,veey 
few teachers want to live there.Third,most people there don't regard education necessary.So 
many warm-hearted students get together to give aid education to those poor children.
    I preciate this kind behavior.And of course,it needs people's support and the government's 
awareness.And of possible,Iwill be glad to be one of those students who give aid education in 
poor areas.

2.   
     Every year,a lot of college students are encouraged to do aid education in undeveloped areas.
As one of the volunteers of the onion "fang cao",I know that four new students will go to the 
west this year.What's more ,we have twelv graduaters in Ninxia for two years now .
     It's no doubt that aid education is of great importance .For those who are born poor ,the only
 way to improve living level is education. Aid education give them love and knowledge ,small but 
valuable.For those who just graduated,it's an opportunity to show his talent as well as make 
contribution to those poor children.They will learn what is most valuable in life.
     I think everyone should have this experience for long or short .Never can one just see the rich .
never can one just waste life ,never can one forget those children with strong desire to learn .Just 
do it and you will learn what you can't get in textbooks.

     In the modern society, there are a lot of college students who are encouraged to go to the poor 
villages to teach the children that live there and that can not afford the study.
     According to some books and papers about college students'going to the poor counties to teach,
it is very important to the development of our motherland.It can increase the development of the native 
education.At the same time,It makes a contribuation to improving the public knowledge level.
     As I see it,It is not only good for those poor children but also can train our college students that 
they go to the villages to help those children.The reason is that college students can add large amouts
of experience about how to live,work,communicate with others and even begin their own careers.What's more
,the college students can also find their own problems and study how to correct it during the course.
Therefore,from the standpoint of mine .It not only benifit for the children but also for the college            
students.



4.
     Each year,thoutands of college students are encouraged to aid education in poor area in China. Despite
frustration and hard ships,most of them find it meamhyful and helpful.
     From the standpoint of me,I support thisaid very much.This activity not only give these students a 
great opportunity to make contribution to our country's education,but also makethem feel that they are a 
part of the souety and must share the responsibility to give all the children a better life.
     In the process of aiding education,they will learn what it is like in poor area .They have to live the
 same poor life like their poor little students for a short time, which most of them would never see in big
 cities.They also can learn communication skills during teaching those kids.My sister once took part in an aid.
After she returned,she changed a lot .You can feel she is more polite and kinder to people.She would be 
stronger and positive whem facing difficalties.She even keeps helping those kids she told by writing letters 
to encourage them.I think that is what changes aiding education could bring to these college students.
     In a word, we should all take part in aid education if possible for the fate of these poor kids as well as    
ourselves



5.
    Nowadays,we live better as our country become powerful.But a few part of China are still poor .To develop those part of China,Aid Education appears.
    Every year, many students in colleges are couraged to go to those poor location to to becomea teacher.They help to develop their education.They give the children much new conception that the kids never heard.They bring hope to those boys and girls.
    Besides,it is meaningful for these students who take participate in Aid Education.Through Aid Education,students experience the poor life and then they would know how luchy they are. Maybe they will change a lot .Some bad manners will be dropped.
    For my own part,so,Aid Education not only can help those poor part in our country,but also it is a great experience for these students.It is meaningful for all of us.   





6.
    Yearly,many college students are encouraged to aid education in poor areas.
     Education is a very important part of a country.Every successful country put emphasis on education.Children are the future of a country.They bring new energy to the world.So their values and characters influence even control the world.
     The activity of aid education is of importance .Now,many college graduates can't find jobs in ig cities.So go to aid educatioon is a perfect choice for them.They are competent and their ability is not a waste.It's of good sence to the country.
     In my eyes,our country should insist on encouraging college students to aid education.Since our education level is very low in some poor areas.Our country should take measures to award the college students who are wiling to go to the poor areas.Because it's a big sacrifice.They use their youthand dreams to support our education.And they are faced with poor living conditions.
     So we should think their work is wonderful.We should understand them.
     I hope more and more college students want to go to aid education.I hope education in our country can be better and better.



7.
    Every year,a lot of college students are encouraged to aid education on the poor areas by school.Espcily in summer holiday.Many students start theirtrail to help the poor students.
    It's meaningful to aid education for those college students.First,most of them come from the city.They hardly know the develapment phenomon of the poor area.And it's a good chance to make them know these.Then,they can get connection with the socity .Aswe know,most of times of college students are spent on school live.They bave few chance to feel the socity.it's good for them on those Zone.Finally,the poor students can get so much thing from the things.they will get many knowlegd from college students.and be encouraged to hard work
    In my opinion,aiding education is a good things for college students and local students.It create many chance to feel socity for college students.It should be encouraged.




8.
    There years,it has become a tradition for more and more college students to offer aid education to poor areas.They're inspired by the society and government to give back their knowledge and love to those who can not afford to enjoy qualified education .
    Since the education of poor areas is weak,aid education becomes a rain to a land which hasn't been watered everysince.aid education gives the poor kids a chance to know what knowlege is.At the same time,college students will also tastethe hapiness of helping others.
    I think aid education is necessary for our country because it's not only a way to improve education qulities,butalso reflects the spirits which our harmony society needs most-kind devotion and love.




9.
    Each year,most of college students will went to the remote place foreducatation.Because there are lot of little boys and girls live in that place were need help.Their family not enough money to keep them for school.
    By this lot of poor children can learn about some new things,and they can find them really faviourate and other way that college students can steel themselves,they will find him/herself can do well anything if they do it by heart.
    In my opionion,This was but also good for that children,and a good playground for college students to make themselves more strong.If I have a change to do this,I will go first.


10.
   There are more and more students going to the poverty places to help teach the children in China now.And the government is always encouraging the college students to take part in this activity.
   As we all know ,the aid education not only helps the poor children but also benefits to the aid teachers---the college students.of course,it helps the development of the education especially in the poor places.It is all known that our country lacks the  teachers especially the high-educated teachers.Then the college student is the best teacher of this kind.They could teach the children the newest knowledge.What is more,they could exercise themselves at the same time on the speeching communicating confidence and the rest!In a word,the aid education benefits both sides.
   In my opinion,the meaning of aid education is more important than itself .Because it tells the college students have the hot heartand are positive to join the activities which are very good to the public .And these spirits are priceless! 


11.
    Every year many college sstudents are inspired to aid education in these poor areas of China.
    It is meaningful to both the individuals and our country.We,college students,are living a colorful life and most of us need not worry about our everyday needs such as food,choth and so on .But what about the students in the poor areas?They bave to help support their family.They don't bave big classrooms.They never think about mordern equipment in the classroom.They also don't care about sharing books.All the things they may not care about.Because all the things can not decrease their desire for knowledge.But many teachers don't want to teach in these poor areas for the low wages and bad condition.So the college students are necessary.They bring knowledge to the kids and also send them the message that our country cares about them.
    As I see it,it is meaningful to aid education in poor areas.We can teach the kids better.Usually,they get a mixclass that is all the grades are taught by one teacheer in the same classroom.Also ,we can bring more attraction to the area to make it better.What's more,we can also gain our experience and improve our thought.So,why not?




12.
    As we know,education is the future of a country.Many countries are strong enough because people in these countries have good situations to study knowledge they want to know.
    To be a member of these strong countries,China can't fall behind in education .So many students graduated from colleges are encouraged to help teaching in many poor parts of China.Every year,a large quantity of college students take part in this encourageous activity.
    For many of them ,helping teaching is a chance to give thanks to our country,give thanks to their parents or just for examing themselves.But for these poor countries.children there can have the right to write,to read and to listen.These may help them do more to creative more chances to make their lives beautiful.
    Surely,as a college student,I'm willing to give a hand to this.Maybe we can't get benefits from it soon,but after a long time ,we may see the big change in China.That is,everyone can do help to our country because we are well educated.Maybe one day ,I will be a part of this team.






13.
    These years,many college students are encouraged by the goverment to teach in poor area,where teachers are lacked of.For our school ,students are often sended to Haiyuan,Ningxiaprovince.This activity is called Aid Education.
    The Aid Education is a good thing for the students of poor area without doubt.For poverty,those students often can't get enough education.Also,the activity is good for the poor area.The knowledge is the most valuable wealth at all.That activity is also a good matler for the society.It reduces the pressure of the job market.
    In my opinion ,aid education is also helpful for the helpers.That experience may help them know more and deeper about China and think more about the life.The Xu Benyu is just such a sample.I think it's rather good for college students to make a right attitude to life and society.





14.
    As we all know,many high school students are encouraged to aid education in poor area every year.This activity is significant.
    First,many students can know the important role they play in the society;they can also be trained,get to konw the sititution of education in poor are.Secondly,the activity can help to improve the education in poor area,also, those students will bring hope and new idea to poor area, not only knowledge. The children in poor area will be happier and feel be loved.Thirdly,the activity promotes love of our society,many people may feel it is necessary to care the poor area,thecountry may give more help to the poor area .
   In the eyes of myself,we should promote this activity to all the country,to all high school.We should weat it as our career.Of course,we must keep and improve the quality of this activity .Just do it!We will have a better society!





15.
    Because of various reasons, such as economy difference,the resourse of education doesn't distribute equally in every district.The lack of teachers and equipment for education in poor place is serious.So every year many students in universites are encouraged to give aid education in poor place .
    The action of students giving aid education help the children in poor place to know more about the world outside and learn more knowledge.This action can also improve the communication between teachers in poor places and university studernts .Besides,university students can improve their social activies and also know more about the need of education of poor places.
    From my viewpoint ,this activity is thoroughly meaningful for it is not only good for the education in poor places but also the university students.We should contime this activity and try our best to make it better.It will be an bonor for us to have a chance to participate in this activity.





16.
    Every year many college graduates are admired to educate in poor areas.
    In this way ,children in poor areas can get good education and can somehow change their fate.If they aren't able to get the good education,they have to continue what their parents do:live in poor condition and have children with poor education and have bad circle .When college students go to the rural areas,they bring some good thoughts there.Which can change mind of children and make them encouraged to make up their mind to make a good living .
    As far as I see it ,aid education is nothing bad  and can exercise college graduates' characters.But if they work there in their whole life,that is really something cruel.Because they may not have enough money to make a good living and reach their initial goal.Aid education should exist,in my opinion,and the graduates should be changed.That is to say graduates work there for only a few years and then be raged a position in a company or something else.





17.
    Every year ,there appears that many students time universities are encouraged to aid education in poor places as voluntiers in china.In a word ,it is a good photomena.
    Not only does it provide a good chance to train themselves in social life but also it does some help to China's education while the aid education becomes  so usual now .Tirsty,students can experience more and suffer more.At the same time ,they can make the best advantages of knowledge they have learnt in school and share them with others.Secondly,it makes their life more wonderful and challenging. As we know,it is more difficult to explain and express something you know to others dearly but rightly than to study and acquire it .At last,it provide abantant educational resurs such as knowledge and teachers how the poor places where many people can not afford enough money to pay how education .Evenly where people have no fund to luild a schooly and to have teachers.So aid education lings much hope to many poor children in mountains.
    I hold much hope in aid education.And I also have strong desire to participation aid education .I can experience much as well as make friends with many lovely children .We can living them knowledge,books,new information,especilly hope and love.
    As a students,especially a colledge students,it is the time we do our duty to our cournty and I think aid education is the best choos.





18.
   The education in China is not cuerage very much .For most time ,Do city children can get the best teachers and educational metential ,but our boy can't get into good schools . In our villige ,chare is a shot chat bave only one teacher,thirty students from grade One to grade Six .Ovn country is still poor nowadays ,so she can not give too much money for these areas.Under this situation,the government suggests the students that graduated from the colleges teaching the poor children in poor areas as aid Education.
   After this suggestion ,every year,there are many students from colleges go to the poor places as aid teachers.They know they are the members of the family that called China.
   This action has many benefits of diffirent aspects.First,they can spport the better education for the poor students.Second,they bring many educational machines for the school.Tirtd,there are rich students,they can bring westgation for the poor areas .The last one ,they can take the information to the all over the China.
   In my opinion ,I support this action .Because I am also a poor student from the northwest of China.I know the situation there.I wish there are more and more people support it.
    



19.
    As the development of society in China,people focus more and more on poor areas .And each year,a lot ofcollage students go the those poor areas to offer aid education without any pay.
    Aid education is g good phenomenon that eve pay more attention to those kids who don't have the condition to learn .Aid education is right for this .It calls on people to do something to promote the kids'condition .Maybe,aid education can not solve the problem.However,it is a symbol which is inspiring us to help them and also informing us that there're still many kids who can not learn. 
    Last summer,some of my classmates parficipaee in aid education .They event to a very poor place called Jingzhai .After they came back,they told me what impresed them and I was impressed as well ."Kids are eager to learn "they said,"It's really a pity that you haven'tgo  with us ".I  am regretting that I haven't do them a favor.I thinks there should be more people involved in such activites so that those kids could be given more chances.





20.
    Every year ,thousands of college students are encouraged to go to less-developed area for aid education .It has become a good way for students to use their knowledge to help society.
    Aid education is a successful route to improve students' ability.On one hand,aid education makes up the lack of education resources in poor area.Students who participate in it can use their knowledge to help those children .It's a good way to solve the unbalance in Chian education college students are easy for children to accept as they may have more commons than ordinary teachers.Young students can also bring new things these children have never seen before.On the other hand ,students' horiten are widen. Communication with these poor children will cause some meditation of  problems in society that will never happen in a university.It's a golden opportunity for students to adopt lives in socity.
    As I see it ,aid education will color my experience and it should count more support from citizens .I will undoubtfully participate in it if there's a chance.





21.
   Education is very important for a country.A lot of students studying in college are encouraged to aid education in some pour regions.
   Aiding education is good to both the aiding and the aided .For one thing,the students aiding education can develop the ability of communication and enrich their experience .For another, the children teached by the students are able to know more about the world out of their village.What's more, aiding education is an effiecient way to raise next two gaps' ability.
   From my own perspective,this action is fit to Chinese .Our country has too many people ,so we have not enough teachers,especially good teachers.If the graduators teach the children ,more and more children will be educated well China will develop increaringly quickly. 






22.
    Every year, many college students are encouraged to teach for a period of time in the western countryside of China ,which are in need of these young people .They bring to the children in these poor area not only knowledge,but also hope for the future.
    The activity of aid education can benefit both side.Firstly ,those children can have a better education obviously.These young intellectuals will tell them the way to gain knowledge efficienty as well as the knowledge ifself.Moreover,the children will know what the world is like and work hard for the bright future.Secondly,the young college students can also have an unforgettable experience .They can be far away from the busy cities and have time to consider their life .The ancomfortable living conditions can give them enough bravity to overcome any other dificulties in their life .After this experience ,they'll be strong physically and menfally.
    For my own part,I find aid education is very worth doing .We can help others as well as do good to ourselves .If I have the opportunity ,I think I'll have a try.






23.
    In recent years,increasing mumber of students graduating from colleges are encouraged and determined to oblige to give aid education in poor areas in China ,especially in the west.
    Needless to say,it's a good phenomenon.To start with ,it benefits the students in poor areas a lot.Having college graduates as their teachers,they have access to the outside world,which not only broaden their horizons,but also give them the dream to go out what's more,it's also good to the graduates.They obtain the opportunity to challenge themselves against the bad environment in poor areas,which motivates them both physically and mentally.As far as the society is concerned,aid education let the graduates know that we need them to contribute to our society,as well as let the students in poor areas know that they need to study hard to go out and reveal their value in society.
    From my own perspective,I'm willing to give aid education and the trend should be advocated in campus.We college students need to seize the opportunity. 





24.
    In recent years,a great number of college students have been encouraged to go to the poor areas to aid education ,which is highly spoken by most people.
    This activity has many significant meanings .In the first place ,as we all know ,the education in China is still not very developed.Aiding education can improve the education level in the poor areas largely.So the students in those areas can benefit a lot from it. Moreover, it can not only practise the college students' abilities of applying the knowledge to the practice but also bring them up a sense of responsibility for the conntry and sociaty.
    As I see it ,aiding education in the poor areas is so enssencial that we must continue it with no effort spored .Only in that way can our country's education develop better and quicker.




25.
   Recent years have withessed a phenomenon that college students in increasing numbers are inspired to attend aid education in some relatively poor areas.
   Undoubtedly, aid education is quite meaningful to college students especially to the students who live in city.First and foremost,they can realize the fact that there are a large number of people who live below the average living standard. Seeing that, college students may form a  awareness that they have the responsibility and ability to change the world .Besides,experiences and knowledge which can not acquire from textbook are also conducive to college students.Last but not least,they can learn how to make full use of their knowledge to help others ,That is more meaningful than to obtain 2 or 3 certificates.
   From my perspective,aid education in poor area is not only a opportunity to enhance our ability but also a challenge which may make our mind stronger.Further more, with the rapid development of cities,stress is emerged as a drastic problem to people living in the city.Aid education in poor area may relieve the stress on college students both physically and mentally.for the simple reason that competition in countryside is far low than that in city.
   Given all the above reasons,we may reasonably draw a conclution that it is beneficial for college students to attend aid education.  






26.
    Every year,thousands of university students participate the Aid Education.They are encouraged by school and society to be teachers in the underdeveloped area.
    It benifits a lot to both society and students themselves .Firstly,those graduates with knowledge can help develope those area.To be specific, their taking the jobs as teachers brings modern technology to the pupils and helps them fulfil their study better.And more meaningful ,those Aid Education teachers are pioneers to help others and attract more attention to those poor area.Secondly,Aid Education can help to arrange those graduates.With so many students number enlarged in academy,there are not enough jobs for graduates in most of the developed cities.Teaching in those underdeveloped is a way to deal with the problem.Thirdly, to graduates themselve, Aid Education is quite a chance to train thenselves and to get themselves job experiences.
    As tar as I see,Aid Education is a sign that our nation pays more attention to those underdeveloped place.It's a good beginning even though we have lot to improve .(such as some one attends this just because he would get an opportunity to a master study when he comes back).I hope more such  program can appear and all of us can help others.devote ourselves to the country and get benifit for ourselves at last.





27.
    Now every year,many educated students from different universities are encouraged to go to some poor places to be a teacher,which is said as aid education in China.
    Aid education is very meaningful.First of all, this may be the first time for students to go into the society.They may face many difficulties and have to solve them all by themselves.What's more,it's not only a chanllenge but also a chance .Students will be more adjust tothe society since it.They will face different forks and different things,which will contribute to their experience .Last but not least, though China is developing faster and faster,there are still some place where children can not go to school .It will belp them to be will educated.
    In my opinion ,it's very proud to be one of them .It not only let us know that there are still many poor place,but also will affect our furture.It will tell us that we should not waste things because some people are short of them .We should do many things to help them.
    All in all,aid Education is a good thing in China.If you have chance,just do it.






28.
    In a long time the western part of China was undeveloped and suffered poverty.Now Chinese goverment takes meansure to develop the west religon,one of them is encouraging the students of universities to go to the west to help teaching in the schools .Every year there are many graduated students are sent to the west.
    This ,so-called"aid education",can surely develop the education of the western part of China much more faster than just giving money to them.The students have high knowledge and great courage so the education of the west will be better than before.And to students themselves.it is also a good chance to make themselves much more responsiable and know to love others.
    I agress with this aid education .We said to be rich no matter which part you are in China,but the east developed,the west not .So it is time for us to help the west in the education.And we students of universities deservethe egaging to the aid education.






29.
   As we know, many students from High-school are encouraged to give aid education at poor places every year .
   Aid education has many advantages.Firstly, it gives young students the changes to live in the country.After this experience they may know happy our daily life is .At the same time,they can bring their knowledge and news to countryside and encourage the children at there to study hard.
   As far as I can see.the Aid eudcation can help high-school students develop the good habit of save because they will live a hard life at there .Besides,they teach the children at there must let them know more knowledge out of books.When youngs get poor places,they may bring some books and clothes to children ,that may also help children to widen their hozien .Above all, Aid education can provide the stage for youngs communicate with the society and make their student-life more colorful.





30.
    How can you refuse a child's request that she wants to go to school?How can you ignore the eyes dying for knowledge?How can you turn down the dream to go out of the mountains?
    Millions of children in China have no access to education while they are eager to study.Many people think that if they give money to the Hope Project,the children can go to school .As I see it ,it's not enough at all.Once they have money,they can  buy books,blackboards and pens,however,they can not buy a teacher.Most of them live in mountains,and few teacher wants to go there.So if we want to help them aid education is a better choice.
    Every year,many college students are inspired to do aid education in poor areas.Everyone was borned eaually,and we all have the right to get education no matter rich or poor .Aid education can banifit both us and the children .The children can get knowledge from us,and we can also get something from them,the joy of helping others.That's why more and more students contribute themselves to aid education even though it takes a lot of time and money.If I have the chance to do that ,there is no doubt that I will do it.






31.
   Many a college student is encouraged to go to the remote ruralpart parts of China for the Aid Education every year.As far as I am concerned.the Aid is quiet meaningful to us.
   There exist at least 3 factors could support my view .To begin with the aid is in badly needed in those remote rural intand part of China .where the educational conditions are not so good,it is always the case that the children there don't have teachers to teach them .Besides,it is a good chance for us to gain a lot of things that we can't get from books in the aid .Last but not least,in the aid,we could win some what ture friendship in the set-backs.which might accellerate the career in the future.
   So,I convince that the Aid Education should be highly advocated in the college and the garvernment is supposed to make more efforts in the Aid.





32.
   There years,a new activity has been more and more popular which means aid education .Every year,there are come thousands of students going to the poor area to  aid education
   The government and parents are firmly for it .
   The last year,in our class about ten students went to aid education .However,I was not able to follow them because of something personal.So,I asked them about their feelings about aid education .They said:"It's very necessary for a student in university .You can learn many things about the lowest people in China which can not be learned in class .And you will not waste your life later."
   I think aid education is very meaningful for us .It can teach us a most important class in our life.I have made up my mind to aid education this year well,luck for me .





33.
   Lots of students in the university are encouraged to go to the poor area to give Aid Education to the children there every year .And that is considered as a good thing by everyone because it benefits both the children there and the students from the city.
   To me,that is true,too.On one band ,the Aid Education may gives the children in those poor places more chance to know what is happenning outside their hometown.The knowledge that the students of the university teaching them could wriden their horizon as well .On the other hand ,the Aid Education could make the students from the cities know more about our country.Let them know that there are still many children living hard and studying hard in a bad condition.That also make them understand that the country need them and they should hard to make contribution to our country in future.
   As a student that have been the poor place to give the children there Aid Education .I do have learned a lot.And I hope that there would be more and more students go to the poor places to give hope to the children there.





34.
   Every year ,many students in colleges are encouraged to do the aid education to the poor areas.That's so kind of them and aid educatoin is good to the country and also to the people.
   The poor areas is short of teachers',so their education is low,and the students there can't have a good right to accept the education.So these places is poorerthan poorer .Then aid education can bring teachers to the poor,and also brings new and grand view to the poor .So the poor will have a new concept to the world,then have ideas to change their hometown from poor.It's good to the poor very much.Ithink aid education is also good to the students in colleges.From the childhood ,the students studied for exam,but now,they study or using.They will regard studying as a career and study harder.On the other hand ,they will have more experiment of all kinds from the aid education.So,I think aid education is good to China,also good to person.
   Aid education can change every one to better.It's a good thing for China.




35.
   In China , aid education is a way to help the west area like Qinghai,Xizang to develop their education and science.If you are willing to go to the west for aid education after graduating from university ,you can get a free university education.
   We know east China is the economy centry of our nation while the west China is not so well developed.Aid education offers many well-educated teachers there.It not only accelated development of the area.but also made the average knowlege level of people there much better.30years ago,most people in Xizang province could not read and write,but today most people there can read and many of them can write.I think another 30years cater in most place of China people will be able to read and write smoothly.
   But we can see that most people go there for aid education just for the free university education .Some years later,they come back for the good living conditon here.It makes some schools,espcially primary schools in west aera,alway unable to find a teacher.I think we can find some people who are really willing to stay there.They will offer a steable condition to these schools.

   Every year,there are many college students are couraged to teach young child in poor areas especially in the weston of China .And there are aslo lots of graducated students who wants to make a contribution in those underelopment places
   Now maybe some one will ask,why should college students doose to aid education in China?It is obviours China has a large number of population .It means we need many teachers to spend their times to take care of their students.How can we have so many teachers graducated students are the best choice.On the one hand ,their hard working can make more child known what is right and what should they do on the other hand ,the competition stress is so strong they can work more better in the future .What's more,if you choose to teach  in poor areas you could improve yourself living ability maybe after this expensive experience you can know how to live by youself.
   How about to me?Ithink aid education in China is a good chance to practise.I can get socitey experience if I have a chance to be on of them.So,I hope more college students  choose to aid education in China.






37.
    Nowdays ,many college students are encouraged to go to some poor areas to do some education work.I think it's a meaningful and useful thing.In this way,we can make the poor area's education better and better.We can creat more chances to be educated for poor children and let them know the world which they live in.It can even change the poor children's life,and make their life better and better.In another area,aiding education is much useful for the college students.It can make them know what's the life of poor people and determind to do some thing for them,for our country;it colorful the students' experence at the same time they can learn how to solve the problem they meet in his aiding education and all of this can make a great contribution to their life.
    I'm thinking highly of this action.I'm waiting for joining them.I think I will be one of them one day and I will be proud of my decision.





38.
   Every year,many graduated university students are encouraged to  some poor places for aid education.This phenomina is very common now.
   Aid education has many aduantages.First,it can make a young student soonly grow up in a short time .The exchange of role which the used-to-be students become teachers,will give the new "teachers" big pressure.And the responsbility also press and educate the new "teachers".In Aid education ,the graduated will learn how to teach others,how to be others symble.And they will get to know many tips of how to connect and be harmony with others,which is in a leader's place.
   Second,aid education will decrease the pressure of hunting jobs.Every year,millions of students graduate from universities,colleges and other schools.The pressure of seeking a good job is for every last graduated student.So the aid education program fits to both sides of students and society.
   Third,aid education will broaden the horizen of poor places.As we all know ,university give students further education ,and the effect is not only on knowledge,but also in many other aspects.It will improve a man from outter to inner.And the effect will pass on.The new knowledge,the new views will be known by the students of poor place.then then whole place.
   So,in my personal view,our government should spend more money in aid education ,and give more profit to the vollenteers.This will make huge effort to our education field.






39.
   Nowadays,in China,there're more and more college students paying  their own time for aid Education .
   As aid Education is such a thing that has many useful meaning .
   For the students who have done this ,they can have better knowledge of our country.We,college students especially who are born in the big city,never live like some poor place in China.
   And the life that in the poor may make us grow up.
   Also ,it can train us .As we need to think more about others,show our ablity and learn to lead our life
   It is also good for the people who accept help .They can show their willings to the student who will play very important roles in future.And may recive some help they need.
   For the nation ,she needs to make all the people have a better life .And the aid Education can help her to do this.
   As my opinion I do really agree for aid education .For I am a collaege students,I needs to know better of our nation and need to do something for our nation.




40.
   In some poor areas in China ,the situtations of all facts are so far below the average situtation that the people there can't receive an education ,they are still fight poverty.they have no ablity to invite a teacher.Fortunately,there are a lot of college studentsare inspired by the facts and do aid education in poor areas every year.
   Aid education is meaningful .it will give the children in poor area knowlege,hope and confidence,it will rise the knowledge standard in China and it may make the children change their home in the future.
   In my opinion ,education is a basic affair in a country ,so does it in China,and it is a way to give every child a new life,which may someday become the strong blood in China,so it is really important and meaningful.






41.
   Nowadays,a large number of students are inspired to teach in the poor regions,many of whom are still learning at the college.
   The aid education is of course meaningful.Firstly,it can bring more knowledge to the kids who are poor and are lack of advanced education .Then by the arrival of these college students,the poor children are sure to receive better teaching .Secondly,it is a good chance to improve the college students themselves.They can express their thought wonderfully and have a better capacity to communicate with others.Finally,for the whole country,the aid education helps to solve the education problem in the poor region more or less.
   When it comes to me,I hold the viewpoint that the society should take measures to encourage the aid edcuation and give more honor to the ones who have taken part in.





42.
   Nowadays,a lot of college students are encouraged to teach children in poor areas per year.I t seems to be a trend.
   As we all know,due to the undeveloped economic and the bad traffic,the students in these areas couldn't get good education.Schools don't have enough money to buy teaching facility.They also don't have good teachers .So aid education becomes very important.
   For most college students are well-educated and they are well-trained before teaching,they will teach those children better. Besides,they could teach more things other than knowledge in books.The students could know more about the outside world.From the point of these college students,they will exercise themselves in poor condition .Not only they can build their bodaies but also they can build their mind.They could also have fun from helping these children .
   Thus,I think aid-teaching is very good.And when I am a grade 3 or grade 4 student,I will try to be a aid-teacher.




43.
   China is a developing country now. The development of China is quite different in different areas.The problem is serious not only in economy but also in education .Many poor areas are seriously lack of educational resourse,especially the teachers.So many students in high schools are called to aid education in poor areas.
   These activities are absolutly beneficial to both the poor areas and the students who aid education .The students are all well educated and they can bring many new things and ideas from the modern cities,which is good for the growth of the children in poor areas.So the stuents not only solve the problem of the lack of teachers but also broarden the eyesight of the children in these areas.Besides,the students can also practise themselves.They may be brave to face the difficuties in their life.
   I am a high school student and I appreciate the students who aid education in poor areas.The activity is meaningful and I hope every student in the high school can experience it.It must be the most valuable experience in your school life and you will also benefit from it in the future.    




44.
    Every year,many college students are encouraged to give aid education in some poor areas of China.
    As is known to us,the development is off balance in China that quite a lot of children have no chance to be educated because of being lack of money .Aid education creats an oppotunity for us ,who live in a society of better condition of education ,to help others and satisfy their right of hunting for knowledge.For government ,it's a good way to improve the level of education of our countries.To us, the aid education is so meaningful that it can help us find ualves of our own .What's more ,through it ,we will realize a real China with undevelopped econemy.Which will fully encourage us in the future study and work.
   For me ,I consider the aid education wonderful.As a student of 20,I even don't know what the real life is,I think aid education will give me an experience.Also,giving others a aid itself will make me happy. 




45.
    Nowadays,more and more students in the university are encouraged to give aid education to some poor country,for instance,someone chooses someplace in Xizang,and some of them make their effort in the small village in Gan su.
    As is well known by us,the aid education is meaningful.In the first place,it is of great help to the children who can't get good education on account of their village being too poor.So aid education gives them opportunities to learn something what the children in the cities learn,and help them achieve success in the later lives.Secondly ,it is also a chance for the university's students to learn ,to practice,to improve their practical ability.What's more,after aid education ,they will be more heartful to  other people and more hardwording.Thirdly,it helps to form up a good society's spirit of showing love to others.
    From my standpoint,we should regard it as an honor to give aid education ,and I am willing to be volunteer to give aid education .





46.
   As we all know,many university students are inspired to go to the poorer place to do aid education every year in China.As the result shows,this action is very important and meanful.
   First,to the poorer place students,they could have better education then before.Education is rather important in every country and nation.If they get more knowledge.they could contribute more to our country and become richer which will help them live a better life .Then,to the university students,they could get some goods from our country or schools. They can also be more successful in their later career though this activity.
   In my opinion ,aid education in China has many goods.Nowadays,work press is becomeing a more important problem.So, aid education in China can give more jobs to university students after their graduation .This may make the fact that many people think that attending university is useless change.
   In all,aid education in China is really a good choose




47.
   Each year,a great many college students are inspired to aid education in poorer areas.They teach the students lessons,organize activities,give them a knowledge of the latest scientific technologies,in order to offer the students an equal access to science and technology.
   In undeveloped areas,schools are usurally lower equiptted.As a consequence, the students don't have any access to computers, well-maintained classrooms or labs.It's almost impossible for them to get the chance to go to college ,which is quite unequal.However,with so much college students aiding education in this areas,this tense situation will be relatively released.The poor area students get to know about the world ,and more importantly,get inspired by our informed college students.They are more likely to make achievements in their study,thereby they will make contribution to developing the poor area.
   As I see it,it is very meaningful to aid education in less developed areas.I myself have been a volunteer,I teach the students English ,and at the meantime,I learn from them.I get to know it is no easy to make a living and start to treasure what I have.We can benefit from each other through aiding  education.






48.
   Nowadyas,"Aid Education "has become a hot word in our daily lives.Every year,many college students go to poor areas to do Aid Educations when they finish their study in school .Some years later,some of them will go back to the city and others will stay longer them.Some of them even spend all their lives in some western areas where Education is very poor.
   Education is the most important to make an area  rich.However,Educations in poor areas are always poor.The lacking of books and good teachers is the most reason  leading to poor education in some western areas in China .Because of Aid Education knowledge has been brought to these areas by these college students.Meanwhile,they also will bring some new concept and skills to these poor areas to help the development.
   In my opnion ,Aid Education is meaningful to our society.It's very helpful to the education and development of our country.And it's also a good chance for our college students to train ourselves.It will do a great help for us in our whole life.






49.
   In recent years,more and more college students are encouraged to provide aids for some poor areas.Because poor areas can hardly provide good education for children .As we know,there are many children even can't have access to school .There are many reasons.But the most important reason  is that they can't affordto  .Compare with education in big cities,they lack advanced teaching tools,good teachers and so on.
   Nowadays,each year many college students are willing to go to these poor and undeveloped areas and help the children .There are many advantages .On one hand ,the college students who had recieved good education have a better under standing of knowledge.They have the ability to teach them.And they share their wonderful experience with their students .On the other hand ,it relieves the pressure of local government on education .The government pay little attention on education on account of some finacial problems.Apart from that ,it is good to college students as well .They can learn many things.There is so many college students are moved by the children .As a result ,they build a good relationship with children and don't want to leave the children when the aid is end.It is a good chance to train themselves.
   From my standpoint ,it is a rewarding experience .As our country develops,there are poor areas and developed cities.We should care about the people in poor areas.They need help now!And we should help the children make their dream come to reality.It is our responsibility.




50.
   A great number of college students are inspired and encouraged to attend the Aid Education Programme in poverish areas every year.
   It is tough for those who live a comfortable life at home to adapt to the life in western China where food and water are even not enough and to the dry climate there.Not to mention that they need to manage to do the teaching at the same time.But it is the envirenment there which  has got a giant contrast with that in the better-developed areas that may change the value of world of those who give aid education .They may learn to value things and to love.As for students who receive aids,their horizon are broaden.It is likely that they will set their minds to endeavour to get a better education and hometowns.
   As I see it ,all the people who attend the Aid Education learn during the process,both teachers and students.The programme attracts attentions to the underdevelop reqion,thus bringing in more aids.
   The teaching life there remains an unfergettable memery for those college students.They can also present the hard life there to more people through their own experiences.As it is mentioned above,they may change the value of life.If there is a chance of attending the Aid Education Programe.I believe it is worth trying.





51.
   In today's China ,education gap between wealthy and poverty places is very large.In eastern China,it's easy to get education in good quality,but in western China in the same time,it's difficult to find a good teacher.Aid education is a good idea to solve this problem.
   Students in our school also take part in the aid education.They go to Guyuan,Ningxia province as a teacher.Aid education is benifit for students in poverty places,because they can get some new information and more qualified knowledge.And in the same time ,hard life there will let the aid educators know the responsibilities they should take,in some meaning,it's also a education for aid educators.
   As far as I'm concerned,aid education is a good way for the sloving of the education gap.We should encourage more college students to take participate in it.But other more powerful actions are needed to enlarge it.





52.
   For recent years,our country is developing fast.But many places are still very poor ,especially in the education .Then,more and more graduates are inspired to be a teacher in the poor places.
   This action ,Aid Education ,has made thousands of children get well education .From the teachers,the children know what is beyond the mountains,how is the city like and many other things about the world.They get the basic knowledge and ability to face the world when they put their feet on places outside homeown .
   From what I saw and what I heard in the last years,I think that the Aid Education can solve many problems.We all know that hundreds of thousands of graduates get out of their university every year.However,there aren't enough works for them in the cities,which makes the graduates hard to find a job.The Aid Education partly solved it ,and in the same time the graduates also get trained when they live in a place very poor.
   Children get well education ,graduate get job and training.What the good Aid Education in China!





53.
   Nowadays,students of universities are encouraged to go to the poor areas to help the aid education there.And in fact each year many of them are practising it and starting up their teaching career there as educators,probally not for a long time though.
   Obviously,it much benifits the children there and improve the quality of education of the vast poor areas.It is a fact that many poor areas are in great need of information and new knowledge from the outside ,but meanwhile there are few methods for them to keep up with the development of the science.the techology and the society.The group of universities' students take with them the advanced knowledge to the children and the new ways of edcation to the local educators.Apart from the knowledge,those young aid educators are encouraging the children and even the local adults,who might have designed all their life in their hometowns,to make an exploration in the outside world.
   At the same time,the students are getting much from their experiences of the aid education .Many studnets back from the aid education bave said that it allows them to know more about the society and his own responsibility to help solve some public problems,such as the education of poor areas.This precious experience contributes to improving their sense of responsibility as well as their ablity of using their knowledge.Identically,according to the practicors,it feels good to help others.
   From my standpoint ,it is much worthy attending the aid education ,both to the children there,who will probablly be helped to set up his dream to go outside,and to the young edcuators,who are to learn his own responsibility to the society.       





54.
   Nowadays,education has been widely spread among China,no matter the rich or the poor .Besides,as I known,a large amount of students of good universities have beem inspired to take the aid education of poor ares.
   There is no doubt that the aid education is really a meaningful activity.When it comes to the significance of the aid education,it benefits both the college students who join the program and the poor area students who recieve the aid education.On the one hand ,the college students are under a tough work aiming at helping others and improving themselves.On the other hand,the poor area students could increase their knowledge and widen their horizons through this way.In a nut shell, it's a wonderful experience to both of them.
   Moreover,from my perspective,I really  see high of the aid education on grounds of its benefits.Last but not the least,what I  want to say is that if I have the opportunity to take part in the aid education, I'll join it without any hesitation.






55.
   Anually,Many a college students are couraged to give aid Education to children in the undeveloped areas .It has almost become a popular trend recently and many college students are proud of such an experience.Indeed, aid education in China does many good not only to the children who receive the help but also to the persons who give it .Some people say that the presont education system is not perfct because we care more about knowledge than life experience.In case of this point,aid education give college students chances to get close to a totally different life .Meanwhile,it provides students opportunities to use their knowledge and help them develop practical skills.As for the pupils or mid-school students in the countryside,they can acquire knowledge and get more information about the world outside their hometown,which helps a lot in their development.
   As for myself.I think it meaningful to do such a thing.Although I have heard of the tough life in the remote espensibility sense to the country and the socity .Also, I'd like to develop a tough character in a different circnstance.I'm sure that experience can help me acquire the ability to face any deffieculties.The most important thing is .I hope I can help others with my knowledge, my ability.For the children longing for edcuation ,aid education is important.In some sense,It's necessary for them to be well edcuated if they want to achieve what they want.I'd like to give them a hand.So I will absolutely glad to give those children aid education if it permits. 






56.
   From this essay,I want to show my opinion about the aid education of colledge students to the poor areas.
   Each year,many students from university are ready to aid education to the poor areas.From my opinion,I think this is a great did for  the advantages the aid education bring about.
   At first, the poor areas are deeply absent from education,and the education from colledge students greatly make up for the education hole.That is ,the children from poor areas are probably given the chance to study.
   The second,to the olledge students themselves,aid education can be a chance to exercise and improve their mental and physical experiences.
   For myself, I totally agree with the atmosphere towards of aid education.Not only the economicalimprovements,but also the cultural developments are the results of aid education to show us.




57.
   every year,a large numbers of college students are couraged to aid education to the poor places.this is a very meaningful thing.First of all,it can improve the children that come from poor places'knowledge.The children will touch some new knowledge. The children will touch some new knowledge,and It will widen their knowledge,this is very important.Secondly,college students will give the childrenmore confidence.because confidence is very imfortant for the children to study.The other reason is that the poor places lack of teachers.So aid education will provide them young teachers that from colleges.Last but not least,college students are so young that they can get on well with the children and play will with them.It wil bring the happiness to the children.
   As I see it ,I am eagerly to join the Aid Education.I have a sense that every college students should do it.we should give our love to the little students that come from the poor places.It will help them to grow up more happily and healthy.







58.
   Every year,many university students are encouraged to go for  aid education to some poor places.As a developing country,there are still millions of children can't afford good education especially in western China.Aid education may not help all of them ,but it just can give them hope.
   And for the students,Most of them have a happy life but did not realize that,when they go on a vist to the poor villaged and fed the hardship of life ,they will be thankful.What's more,in the aid education,they can learn how to show their love to others and find the valuement of life.Moreover,in they spare time,they can do some research as well.In the end of aid education ,students can return with a lot of useful information.It will be very helpful for release the gap between the rich and poor.
   As a university student,my view on the aid education is that it's a good way to enrich our life in university and help others.






59.
   In china every years,there always are a lot of college student going to the poor area to aid edcuation .They do a big help to the edcuation in China.Aid edcuation is not only an important part of the education,but also a good thing to both student in college and the students in poor area.
   First,the student in the poor area can get well educated from the college students.As we know, the poor area always need good teachers to help the children get knowlegle,but there always is none teacher going there .So, aid education will help the chirdren,and also help the area get out of poor in future.
   Second,the students who go to aid education also get a exersice by this way .Now, lots of students just know how to learn the knowledge but can't teach others.They can't let the knowledge go out.So,the aid education will help them.
   In my opion,we should join in the aid education.We can help others and help ourselves,and I think if we can't join in it ,we can let the people know it and let more people join in the aid education.





60.
   Nowadays,an increasing number of university students has been encouraged to join aid edcuation in poor areas.And they are happy to help the children there.
   Aid edcuation has been founded for years.Joining the aid edcuation can rich our university students' knowledge about poor areas and the life there.
   Meanwhile,the children there can accept education normally.Since the areas are so poor and far away,there is no teacher who wants to work there.Then aid edcuation is important and necessary.During aid edcuation,many students have gained deeply friedship with the people there.
   In my opinion,aid education among university students is benifit to both people in poor area and ourselves.Our life is much better than before,so that there is less passion to work hard.All we want is enjoyment.However,large amounts of people in poor areas even can not go to primary school.So I think every student should take an active part in aid education .





61.
   In the morden world,the level of our life is increasing and improving,but there are still some place in China that the people there are poor and students there can't afford to study.Every year,more and more college students are inspired to give aid edcuation in the poor places.I think it's necessary.
   Firstly,the college students bring the hope and chance of edcuation to the children in poor places.They not only teach them the basic knowledge but also give new thoughts to them.Because of their coming from bigger cities,they can teach them with the newest things to spread the children's knowledge what's more,they can also help the people there with new technology.
   Secondly,giving aid edcuation in China can also test themselves.If a college student have the experience of giving aid education in China before his seeking job,he will obtain more chances because of his experience.It can also test his characteristic to become a strong person.
   In my opinion,it's necessary for college students to give aid edcuation in China .It can not only help others who are in poor but also make oneself grow more.As one of the college students,we should be for it and take part in it avtively,and the goverment and college should also make more chances for college students who want to give aid education .It's a great thing.






62.
   For thereare some areas still developping,these areas' educations are not well.Every year,many univercities have students to help these areas' education .I think it's a good thing.We developped cities have to help the developping areas.This action can help them make their educations well.Then,they will have abilities to develop well.
   In my idea,we are one country.Only we get rich is not enough.We should all get rich .And if they want to get rich ,they should get good education.Only when they have science and techledge,they could catch up with us.
   We should get aid edcuation of China,for a light funther of China.





63.
   Every year,a mount of college students are inspired to aid education in China .There is no point that it is a meanful action.
   As to students,an experience like this can improve themselves,They go to poor areas with a love heart.As everyone knows,experience is needed in job more than before.Hard-working ,the spirt of hever giving up,the ability of passing through difficulties.I am sure these will be gainned to them.Society is very different from school yard.It is time for them to exam me what they have learned.On the other hand,a deep visit to unknown places can help them to get to know the world.
   When it comes to county.it is a powerful way to cut the grip between rich places and poor areas.Our country sticks to education all the time ,There is no saying that they solve some job problems and develop education at the same time .
   To children in poor education means their lives change.
   I encourage university students to have a try.One or two years is also available to enrich oneself.If you have an oppoturnity,just take it!







64.
  China is a big country,and has the biggest population in the world.But,China is not a developed country,there are a lot of kids that they have no chance to get education or well education.Like Shantai,Beijing ,these cities are high developed,and also the education.The children there can buy series of very good books,their teachers are the best ones in China,while,there are also some country-side places that the kids there even don't have a classroom,a teacher,they have to do many hard work to live,they can't use well books,pencils. 
  For these situations,every year there are many high educated college students to pioneer to these places to teach childern there,and the government encourage more college students to do this,let them go to west parts of China.
  As a teacher,their responsibility is teaching children,no matter poor or wealthy ,teaching is a great job,all people respect them and need them.
  As far as I am concerned,there eight universities that are free but if you are one student in these universities,when you finish your college you must go tosome poor places to teach the children there.I think this is a good method to improve the education if those poor places. 






65.
   Each year,many students in universities or collages are inspired to give aid education in poor areas.
   Aid education is good for both the students and the kids in poverty.The kids can get education.But more important,the kids can know the world outside via their young teachers.They can know about the culture,the economic,the life style in the ourside world,whilch not only broaden their  horizens but also inspired them to make their effort to study and go outside.On the other hand ,the student or young teacher can learn about the country life .However,the more important is that,they may know from then on that our country is still poor,and there are still many people live in poverty in whose life every mimute is hard .That will encourage they to work hard to develop our nation and give a hand to the poor in their rest life
   As I see it ,aid education is something absolutely good.Maybe it should become a regulation or even a course in university for us students to give aid education.






66.
    In recent years,there are more and more students who study in university give the Aid Education to the poor place's student.Encouraged by the goverment and society,the number is raising so quickly.
    I think the Aid Education to low developed place is meaningful.In my idea,the people who can go to college have high education,the can help other people and teach them numbers of knowledges.The other meaning can be listed as followed.Poor places always have low development and often have few highly edcated persons.So there often no people to teach the children .Students in unversity have to do something for our country
    For the people who give Aid education to the poor place.It do good to themselves live them good experience and do helpful for their future.



   

67.
   Nowadays,more and more college students are encouraged to aid education for the poor area every year.Thus,it has developed into a tendenly and had enjoyed a great popularity among most college students. 
   Aid education in the remote area is of great significance.To begin with college student can provide high education for the children .So it will enhance the level of edcuation in the poor area.With more students sent to those area, those area will make bigger progress in education .What's more,it's benefical for the college students .When they are seat to aid education,they are practised at the same time，they can accomulate lots of experience and skills while aiding education in the areas.Last but not the least,our country and society will be developed in a long run.With the level of education enhanced,people may become richer.
   For my perspective ,I think the college students should be encouraged for there existing lots of meanings.But at the same time,the government and univercities should limit the quantity.When so many students flux into the remote area,it's a heavy burdon for the remote area.In a word,we should make a balance.

   There is a trend that many college students are inspired to help for aid education poor areas in China every year.They have themselves live there to improve the poor education condition of rural areas,on the other hand also to experience life .
   There are many advantages about aid education in China .It's a excellent way to reduce unbalance between east and west.For our own country,we spend much money to promote a collage student.Students learn a lot from further steudy after high school .The knowledge they receive will be back giving them the ablity to teach others.Viaing aid education ,the knowledge can be made best use.That is to say,the education in our country can be made a step further.For people in poor areas,it's a good oppprtunity to receive new things which they can't get even in their whole life in their hometown .They can learn the lastest technology,increations and other useful things.This help them to make up their mind to improve themselves.For collage students' themselves,it also a good way to put the knowledge they have learned in classes into pratice.It can enrich their experience of life.
   In my opinion,aid education is a great measure in our country.It can release the gap between poor and rich .It also help us to know the situation of our country.As a collage student,I think it's our duty to make our country stronger.Aid education is a suitable way to make our dreams come true.

   Every year,there are a lot of students from universities to go to aid education in the areas which are poor.They are encouraged by the government.
   It's obvious that the students can get a lot during aiding education.They can know different people and different cultures.The most important is that they will face lots of difficult problems.They will also get a lot of happiness when help others.The local children also get much .They can know the China better though the young teachers.They can also get a lot of knowledge.
   In my opinion,every side can get much benifits.The government can develop the local economy.The students from the universities can get a lot from aiding education The local children can get better education .





70.
   Every year,many students who are just educated from colleges are chaired to be a teacher at the poor places .Some people support it,and some people believe that it's a big waste.They all have their reasons.
   Some people think that aid education is a good choice for college students.To be a teacher at a poor place needs great courage.The life there must be very hard.And the hard life these students experienced would be much useful to there future.Hard life can make one person grow soon.These graduators who attend the aid education can also learn many things that they can't learn from books.On the other hand ,aid education is also useful to the development of the poor places.As the old saying goes,"knowledge is power".The knowledge which these graduates bring can do much to the development of the poor area.
   But there are also many people who are against this thing.They think that it's a waste of time and money.Our country spend much time and money on every students who are in college.So after they graducated,they should soon find a work and then work for the country,but not waste time on teaching kids how to work out problems like"1+1=?".They believe that using college graducates as teachers is a waste .They should spend time on things which are more meaningful than that.
   In my opinion,I suppor college graduates to do aid education .As a pend who is just graduated from school,he doesn't know how to use his knowledge to make money.Hard life can make people grow soon .Some years of aid education can let a person who knows nothing about how hard life is know more.And this experience can also let him know how to get money with his own hands.







71.
   As we all know that China are developing very fast,but there are still a group who cannot afford their edcuation .Based on this fact,many student in campus show their hearts:aiding education in poor areas.
   Why there are so many students in campus aiding?Most obviously,it let more children have oppotunities to study.Also ,this action reduce the burden of many families and then these families have more more fund to improve their children's living standard.
   As far as I concemed,this kind of behavior shows a phenomenon that people are happy to suspect aids.What's more ,it can accelorate the developing pace.Why?First ,these students help those children ,they also gain many experiences and make friends with childrens ,thus having a better ability to develop.Second ,it shows a spirt,which can't disappear in this society.Helping each other must help develop.So I think it observe to do.






72.
   At present,lots of college students are greatly ercouraged to make a contribution to aid education in less-developing area.USTC is not the exception.Three Down to Town is the typical and brand event which is one of the most popular campaign amony the students .
   As this aid education become so hot ,more and more people doubt what they can gain during it.As one of the volunteer,my roomate explain why he took part in it .Firstly,it help us understand how to deliver the love.It's unfamilior for us to give our cove to others,that is to asy ,we are a litter selfish.However,after aid education ,you are greated by changed soul.Secondly,you will turn into more experienced and acknowledged mind .In new place,you learn that everthing around you is fresh challenge,By solving these challenge,you life can meet a little but exciting change.Last but not the least,you will learn life is good.Comlaint,anxiety and angriness in the previous time is a joking .How couraged the people in less-developing area make a living?All in all,aid education in fact educate ourselves.
    Personaly I think ,the aid education is necessaty for us .Up to now,we gain a lot by parents.friends and society,it's time to send about we gain to society.The aid education is a good choice.As a college student in modern times,it is our responsibility to help the students in less-developing area.During it ,we re-recognize that how meaningful the life is.






73.
   Now,more and more college students,atter they graduate,make the decision to participate in aid education instead of finding a job
   Aid education is of great importance.The governmet also takes many policies into effect to encourage college students to devote to aid education 
   Firstly,many children in poor area,especially the west,don't have chance to study in school on account of the lack of teachers.So aid education can help solve the problem.Secondly,as we all know ,the gap between the east and the west is ecoming clearly.But how to solve the problem?I think aid education may be one way.Knowledge is money.So if we can provide them with good education ,they can live a better life.
   For my own part,I stand up for the aid education .Since many people can benefit a lot.Why don't we give a hand?But I also want to say that different people have different opinion on one thing,we encourage college students to join but we don't compell.






74.
   Nowadays,Aid Education becomes more and more populor in many universities and colleges.In addition ,many students in these schools are encouraged to aid education at poor-area in China.
   We cannot be emphesize the importance of Aid Education too much.Let's talk about the reason .At the begin with ,Aid Education can improve the growing of students.It may make them know what is life and what is love.Then,students may become more loveful during.they giving their love-heart to everyone who need help.It makes a great contribution to the health of students.Therefore,the students in poor-place not only be helped in education .but also they will find the main -idea of their life.The last but not the least,Aid Education benifits the growing of the Chinese education .
   In my opinion ,Aid Education is a necessary measure to high-schools so as the poor-schools,in order to "product" more fine students to improve the forward-steps  of our homeland.Even we can say that Aid Education is important for all human-beings.








75.
   Every year,a lot of college students are encouraged to aid education in the poor and distant areas,which has a great meaning both to individuals and our country.
   First to the poor areas,children there can receive enough and even good education to be well equipped to change their desting of being  trapped in the undeveloped villages.Kids apart,adults can also enrich their scientific knowledge to enhance their work ability.In addition,spreading knowledge can also improve the local residents' aware of modern civilization and help them get rid of some ridiculous traditions and belives.Second to those university students involved in aid education ,it's a very meaningful experience during their life and teach them about the great virtue of giving as much as they can.Although the life in poor areas may be too tough for them.,they may have more courage to face any diffficulty in the future if they can overcome the current obstacles.Last to our country,the program will help improve the general level of education of the mass and do a lot of benefits to the development of our country.
   In my opinion,it's a good idea to participate in the program of aid education .It really can broaden our horizons and improve our ability to communicate with others.I think it's duty for every one who has received education to repay our country by spreading education and knowledge to those poor areas. 






76.
   Every year ,many college graduations are encouraged to teach in poor countries,which makes a lot of differences.As we all know,some parts of China,such as western part,need teachers and education resources.Many children there can't get nomal education .They don't have new books or excellent teachers or even a wide and clean classroom .The moment we see their eyes full of inches for knowledge we can't help being inspred and lending them a hand .As a college student .It's a honor to give the poor children aid education me .Aid education makes a lot of differences. Aid education can help balance the education resources between developed and underdeveloped cities.What's more,aid education is also a chance for graduations of devoting their knoweldge to society.Repaying the society doesn't only mean manage a company or invent some new inventions .Some little things is also very  meaningful.Third,helping is also a traditional noble quatitisy.To make our motherland more prosper ,it's our duty to make a slight contribution to the society.
   As for me,I hope I can get a chance to teach poor children someday.I also hope many graduations choose this way,too.With such firce competetions for jobs.Choosing to poor parts to teach may be a good decision.






77.
   Each year,many graducated colledge students are inspired to teach in the rural area.
   As to this trendency,there is much point in aid education .Firstly,we can bring in many new methods to hlep the kids there pursuit their dreams just like ones in the other area.What's more,we are doing sth great to countribute to our nation.with improved education ,the rural area will catch up with other area gradually .So ,we are helping to narrow the gap between the poor and the rich.Besides,as to ourselves,it can help to enrich our life and receive much precious practical experience.
   As far as I'm concerned,I want to join them too.I think ,helping the kids can help me to realize my value as a college student .In addition, through the process,I can understand life better and lead a happier one.







78.
   There are many places in China now cannot offer enough education for the children,these places are poor .Children here must go to work to share their family's difficully.So there is no money and no time for them to go to school.But in fact,it is the most important thing that go to school for knowledge.So every year the universities in China inspire their students fo Aid education in the poor place.This work is very valueble for a university student.It can not noly offer students a job in order to make their society experience a prograss ,but also bring the knowledge to the poor children .
   In my opinion ,it is neccessary for a university student to aid education .because ,There are not many things to do for the university student in their spare time.Most of them go to see the films ,play computer games and sleep all day.So this work can make them use the time in the right way.And the poor children also have the rights to learn knowledge.So aid education is neccessary The young are the future,so let's do our best to make our future more wonderful.






79.
   Nowadays,a number of students who will graduate from the colleages are motivated to be a teacher in some remote or poor areas of the country.To make more students prefer to accepting the job, the government will provide some money or other reward to these students for their contribution .
   The phenomenon above is just a reflect of the activity named"Aid Education in China".Through the activity,the government hopes that the children in those areas would have access to better education .What's more,the local economical development is also likely to be promoted for the coming of those young people.Moreover,with the increase of our population,it's harder and harder for we students to find a job .The activity can decrease some pressure of the society for lack of chances of jobs.
   As far as I can see,to join in the activity is good for both our country and ourselves.Because we can gain a lot of working experience and broaden our horizon during the period of working in other areas .So it's reasonable for we students to take part in the activity.






80.
    At present ,more and more students in the college are encouraged to go to the poor places for aid education .This activity is of great benefits for both our college students and the poor places.
    For our college students,aid education is a new experience.We would enjoy the feeling of helping others with our knowledge.At the same time,we can know what life is like in the poor places,and this may change our attitude towards life ,may help us get rid of wasting money or other bad habits.For the poor places,aid education can bring more knowledge,help the children to study and make their life better and better.
    All education is really a good activity.But in my opinion,it's not a good choice for all the students.Students who come from the contryside have no need to join the activity and they should pay more attention to their studies.Students who choose aid education should make full use of this chance to help other people and improve themselves.Aid education can make more people have a briliant future.






81.
   Nowdays,"Aid education "have become more and more popular with colleague students.Lots of students are encouraged to serve as a teather in some poor areas.For example,our USTC have a group to serve for aid education in Gu Yuan,Ning Xia province.Generally,the time is one year
   Aid education is important to the development of poor areas and it can contribute to the development of colleague students.On one hand,education is the most important thing for the development of poor areas ,and aid education may be a good way to improve their standard of education .On the other hand,aid education can help enrich the experience of collegue students and help them to learn more about their country.What's more, collegue students can collect lots of information about poor aeras during their aid education.It can help the goverment to carry out right policies.
   In my opinion ,serving as a teacher in poor areas is a good way to contribute to our country and it is also a good way to enrich our experience and develop our ability





82.
   Aspired by the policy of developping the west for overall better off,many graducates are going to the west such as Tibet,Qinghai where the educational conditions are comparitively poor,with a promise of aid education 
   Aid education has at least three significant effects.Firstly speaking,it makes the students in poor regions have an access to a better education and become more likely to achieve success in the future.Then they can repay to the country.Second,via going to the poor area,colledge studetns could broaden their horizon and practice their ability.In the other hand ,let the graduates know that there are places in their country that need them,it's an insiration for them to set their great ambition and construct China .Last and most important ,aid education helps China develop in a balance way and has lasting effects.By bringing in elites to the poor region can help that area become prosper.
   In my opinion ,I totally support this policy.Because I was born in a poor province and I knew how eargly the poor regions need the help of aid edcation.As a member of colledge students,I will undoubtedly give my hand to the project of aid education if I have the opportunity.







83.
   There days we often hear that many students in college are encouraged to aid education in China .It common that the place that the student aid is very hard and poor.
   Therefore,why does such circom show we ocur inspire of social profect?For one thing Aiding education can devolop our ability to adapt the socity in the futrue.We can get many knowlegde what we can't get it in school.For another,aiding education can also help the children in the poor place.They need and want to teamknowledge too
   I am concemed the aiding education is a preferable thing than only learning in collage in many seuses.The reason is obvious Because a natural conclusion from the above words is that aid education not aslo help us ,but also help the children .As a collage student,I am supposed to take an achive part in aiding education in the future time.






84.
   Every year, a lot of college students are encouraged to aid education in those poor areas.They spend their summer holiday with those children teaching them and playing with them.
   It's really good for both college students and children in poor regions,To those college students, they could make a contribution to the education in China with what they have learned in the past years instead of playing computer games or surfing the Internet all the vocation.Then they can also learn how to work together with each other and how to communicate with workmates,which is very useful for their future.What's more,they will do this as their own jobs and could live a different life so that they may grab something or some thoughts about the life .On the other hand,it's more useful for those poor children .First ,they wounld learn more knowledge besides their textbook.Second ,they can see the different word from their own which may have an encouraging effect on their life.The last not the least,they will make friends with these college students and friends are always important on the road,as someone sail.
   On my persond note,it's no doubt a good choice to aid education in my summer or winter vecation,especially I would do something to the poor areas and the children living thee.I believe ,these poor regions will improved faster and faster,if more and more people including college students contributed themselves to them.





85.
   Nowadays,many college students are encouraged to go to some poor regions for aid edcuation each year.
   It means a lot ,not only because the college students can help improve the education quality in those area,but they slso borden the horizen of their students.Meanwhile,the knowlegable college students can bring something new to their students such as the ways of thinking and the frontier of science and technology which can make the younger ones more interested in the nature of the world.Still,college students can also benefit a lot from the aid education ,they can experience something that they cannot learn in the books,and through these activities,they will be more socialized too.
   As far as I am concerned,it is a good chance of us learn how poor some area is which will make us learn to cherich money,water supply,electric power and so on.We can learn through helping others.So why not take part in such meaningful activities?







86.
    Every year there are large number of students in colleges are encouraged to be a teacher in some parks of China where are poor.These colleges students are doing aid education.
    Most of them will not need too much many for their jobs or even they are free.They have a other name is volunteers.The aid education teachers are very important for society.In China ,many poor ereas have not encough teacher to teach so many students and some teachers in there maybe only graduated from middle school.They can't teach students very well because of their knowledge. The students from colleges,universities have enough knowledge to teach students in primer school or middle school.And they are younger enough to do something that are heavy.The students in poor areas could learn more things from the aid education teachers and they will have a brighter future.
   In my aponion ,college stduents to aid education is a meaningful things.During the aid education time,they can get large numbers of experience of society.If the students are come from developed cities they will know how hard the life is .These are also very helpful for their live and searching jobs in future.






87.
   As we know,many students in high school always make contributions to aid education in China every year.
   To be a teacher in some undeveloped place that couldn't make you money.The life of it may be very poor.But as we know.There are so many children can not go to school like us in so many place.Why?They may be too poor?Their family may be not let them go to school only because their parents want they to do some farm .There are also many children do not study at schoool but go out find a job in city.We have to say,the most important reason is poor.They are to poor!Our Party's aid is make all the people to be rich.All the people,not matter he or she is in city or in the town .Our Party must give them a good chance to sit at school be educated well .Knowledge is everything a man without any knowledge is knowledge with charge your life.We shoud make all the children in China even in the world can have a good education when they were young
   As a student in high school like as we should make us to know it to know there are even some children have no chance to go to school.We should.We should do something ,do something to change it!That's my opinion.


  




88.
   Every year,a lot of students in universities are encouraged to do aid education in some poor area in China.
   It is very important to the future of China.In some poor areas ,many children are desired to learn but there is no teacher to teach them.Some children may be born with talents.However,if college students teach them a lot of knowledges,their talents may be explored and they will be useful to the society.The knowledge is the power .If the children in poor area is well educated they may help their family to get rid of the poor situation.and even the poor area will be rich.So I think it is very important for college students to do so.
   As a student in university in my view,if I have a chance to do aid education .I'll do it without lestation .For me,I can expand my view help others and learn a lot .And it is also good for the country.In a word ,aid education is very important and helpful.






89.
   Trend has it that every year numerous college graduates are motivated to carry on aid education in the remote rural districts and backwaters in China,bringing the most up-to-date knowledge and information to the children who are equally eager to accept the same level of education just like their urban counterparts.Their approach,without doubt,is warmly welcomed by the residents who strive to cater to their basic material needs even though they themselves are struggling inspired by their students' instiable curiosity towards knowledge ,the college student fully devote themselves to the education career,genuinely hoping to assist them to gain self-improvement 
   Needless to say,the significannce of aid education is to strike a education balance between the rural area and the urban districts.By distibuting college students to the backwater in China,the government aims at provide the students there with equal access to the latest knowledge as well as the brand new technology simply for the for the fact that the college graduates are the ones who harboun the most advanced technology know-how .Besides,after experienced the inforion life in remote areas ,the college students also acquire a vivid lesson of society,with their resolution strengthered and resilence exercised Consequently,they may more likely to easily adapt to the ferocieus competition in their  future career and unfearful to deal with any conumdrums and dillemmas in the work.
   As far as I'm concerned ,the aid education activity is undoubtedly a reciprocal experience to both the students in the less-developed area and the college graduates merely because both sides are obtaining self-enhancement and positively influenciry each other during the process .Therefore,never should we pause our step to encourage college graduates to the rural areas and ever put forward new policies to appealing to more prospect.

   Every year,a large number of college students are encouraged to go to poor areas where they act as teachers.It is called "aid education".They stay there for couple of weeks and teach the children in poor areas.They also live with the kids and have a different time.The aid education is an activity that combines the college students,who are the base of country,with poor areas.The meaning of aid education is not only to help the local kids lrarn more and better,but to help the college students learn more as well.I think through aid education,the college students may have a deep impression on poor areas.By living with the kids there,they can tell how hard the life can be instead of learning it only from newspapers or TV.They may be touched,or inspired.They may want to work harder in order to rebuild the poor areas to So in my opinion,I think aid education in China is a great idea to make our world more beautiful and make our lives better.








91.
    It's widely known that many universities have taken measures,hightly inspiring their students to take aid education in some poor areas of China,every year.
    As for such kind of phoneomana,it is undoubtedly of much sense.First,it makes quite a lot contributions to the education career in our country.Those college stdudents bring advanced knowledge they have learnt in cities to the undeveloped and remote villiages,instilling the knowledge to the children who have no access to school,which will promote the growth of next generations to some degree.Second ,aid education is able to strengthen the bonds between people in rural areas and those in urban areas.When people in urban areas have much contact with those poor people in rural areas,they reconstruct their previous thoughts;they begin to show sympathy towards them but not contempts.In this way,people in our country are going to live harmoniously.Third,through aid education ,students (mostly from cities)experience the real big difference by themselves between prosperous cities and baren rural areas,which means a lot to themThey see some people are actually living a tough life.They will consider more when they blow money out on masses of nonsense staff.They grow up.
   As for me,I strongly support the measures .It should and requires to be encouraged.





92.
   In China ,a great number of graduates are encouraged to give aid education to the poor area who are from key universities of colleges each year.An increasing number of students go to the remote western areas when they just leave school with various young dreams.
   In a developing country like China,especially in its undeveloped western part,education should be attached great importance to.If the children in poor area can't be educated well there will be no chance for these areas to be developed.Give the next generation enough education and they will have opportunaties to go out and get back to make contribution to their hometown.But the resource of teacher within these area may not rich.So calling on the young to go west as teachers appears to be very necessary.
   From my veiwpoint at this thing,it is not only help to the undeveloped areas ,but also an exellent challenge for these young graduates who devote their best times to the education career.It will let them understand the significance of education and make their life they had owned more precious in their eyes which is without concern of clothes,food or the chance of going to school.





93.
   In 21th century,a lot of college students are encouraged to take part in aid education in poor places nearly every year.I notice the phenomenon and I believe the activity is very meaningful.
   Aid education give chances to both college students and poor children in some places without enough education source.Firstly,for college students,they can practise themselves to struggle with bad environments,by the time,they may get better understanging in developing of Chinese ecnomic.At the same time,for students who hoped for further education ,big brothers and sisters with modern knowedge would help them to rebuild their dreams about future.View of their eyes will be wildly open and that's exciting thing for both themselves and their parrents.
   Actually,I  joined the team of aid education in our school last summer.To tell the truth,it was difficult to sleep when there's not a fan to cool the room.But,I know I leaned a lot about farmland of China.I have to think a lot when something unbelieveable came into my eyes.By the time,our team build deep friendness with local children and it was obviously that everyone were happy with the activity.






94.
   Each year,most of college students were encouraged to do teaching in which were poor.It's very popular that time,with the science and technologe developed,more and more young people could choose their future to do the well things
   Aid education in China expecially in westren of China.It's good for our country in that time,but for our earth futurn.Because of our country don't develop well,lots of students in poor area can't go to schools,and the "aid education "is very well solve this problem one goes:"education  well and country better". we can let our children leave school even we are very poor.if you don't learning you can't get a well future.Also,the "aid education"get lots of job position for more and more young people ,they can develop very well from the "aid education "and then our country economic will raise and our live will better in the future.
   In my opinion,we must help each other and I agree with the aid education ,for we can stand at well study environment and set at worm classroom.We must help the students who can't learning and living in a poor family.if every one can do a small action to help the children .We are society will be more harmany and our country will be more light.







95.
   Now,our government takes many measures to help and encourge graducates to aid education in poor area especially the west of China.So,every year there are many graduates who are encouraged go to poor area to teach those children who are eager to study.
   No doubt,it has very large sense because those poor place are not attractive for many teachers,so the education quality of these places is quite low.However ,due to these graduates aiding education their education will improve and those educated children will use their knowledge to design their hometown .In other words,Aiding education can promote the economy improvement of those poor places.What's more,children are the flowers of the future.If more students get better education .it will have a large effect on the hometown even our country.
   In my opinion ,aiding education is very sensible.Maybe in the future I will join it and devote my knowledge to those children .






96.
   Every year,a lot of college students are called to aid education in pool place in China.In summer vocation ,a lot of students go to countries or others pool place with their teachers ,which is popular in college.
   Aid Education is a good thing for us and students aidded.At first,many college students had nothing to do in vocations,and it would be a waste of time.Aid education is a good practise for them.And then Aid education is good practise for them.At last aid education could devolop our country's education .Students which are aidded by them would have better thought in future.
   In my opinion,Aid Education in China is a good chance for college student.This is a good experience for us.





97.
   After opened the door,the economy of China didn't develop in balance in different districts.Some cities became prosperous while many places are still poor.As a result,a phenomenon mushroomed .In the recent years,more and more college students are couraged aiding education in the poor districts.
   No doubt,aiding education is a very meaningful and noble behavior.
   First of all,it helps the children gain more oppotunities to accept education in these area.It is crucial.In the poor region,the resource of education is scarce.But knowlegde is the most powerful weapon to get rid of poor .Aiding education satisfied their hot desination and probably change the children's lives.
   Further more,it is also significant to the college students themselves.I think that they must be moved by the children's desire of  knowledge.In aiding education ,they will learn much more which couldn't be seen in the textbook .It has benefits in their future lives.
   Aiding education shows the noble maralities of our Chinese nationalities.I think the scale should be further expanded.So more children sould be helped.More college student learn more as well.It is a reciprocal strategy!




98.
   Every year ,many college students are encouraged to aid education in poor areas.It's thought to be a valuable activity.
   On the one hand,college students can help these poor kids by aiding education .We all know that education resources are unequally  distributed in China.Those students from poor coutris,remote areas can only get some education of low quality .So with the help of college students ,they can get better education and open their horizens.On the other hand,at the  new of college students it's a rewarding activity.At the process of helping others,they not only make use of what they have learned but also find a way to make contributions to the society.They are also trained and getting experiences of life at the same time.
   At my standpoint,aiding education should be encouraged and praised.I come from a poor country where education can hardly be compared to it of the cities.The teachers are not quite qualified and only a few kinds of classes are awailable .So I know deeply in heart that aiding education is very important and means a lot.What's more,by aiding education ,we college students can learn the difficulties of life for poor people which will encourage us to study hard to help them and make contribution to our country. 






99.
   Every year,there are a large number of college students who are encouraged to aid education in poor areas.This is a good pheonomenen.As we all know ,the poor education level in poor areas has stopped the development of our country in some point .If children can not be well educated.they can't do more for the construction of our coutry.As it is ,knowledges is power.Knowledge can help us find new technology.So we can make more money.
   If somebody is well educated,he can do many good things for society.He will know what law is ,and will be careful no to do bad things .So Aid education in China is very important.
   As I see,I think it is a good choice to aid education in poor area when graduateed.It can help me touch much new things and I will know more .Otherwise ,I can do something for my country if I do so.It's a good chance ,isn't it?

   Every year,a lot of college students are encouraged to go to less developed area to aid education there.Taking my university for an example ,every summer there would be an activity called"Education ,science ,culture Going to the Countryside".Many students volurteer to help the children in the country to learn more and do some other things helpful to develop the economy.
   Aid education is very meaningful especially in China .As we all know ,the gap between rich and poor is very wide and the education resoure distribution is unbalanced.Commonly,education is one of the most important way of a poor child to climb the social ladder,and the unbalanced distriction resource may worsen the gap .So,it is necessary to do aid education in the countryside.On the other hand ,student themselves can also get a lot from the experience ,such as social responsibility teaching ability and the knowledge of what the real world is.
   From my standpoint of view,it is necessary for the goverment to carry out more policies like aid education and make it a rountine for college students to go down to the country.What's more,students should participate more in aid education and devote ourselves to make the society more harmounious.

   Today,Aid Education is more and more popular.Every year,There are many colleage students going to the poor mountain place and working as a teacher .
   In China ,many mountain place are lack of teachers.The children there are desired of education .So,Aid Education play a important pole in society activities.Aid Education can help the children who live in poor place learn more and help the children get a knowledge of the rich world.
   In my view,I agree with the aid education a lot .First,I am a volunteer.I have ever taken part in a aid Education .The children in the poor place are very lovely. they are desized of knowledge.You can't imagine how the aid education mean to these children .Their spirit of study move me.I think that work as a teacher in the poor place not only help the children ,but also help myself.Aid education let me know what I have done can help others much.Beside ,aid education let me know what I have done isn't enough.I must study hard,Then I will be able to help the children with education even their life in the future.I work more hard,Then I can help more.
