As the development of society in China,people focus more and more on poor areas .And each year,a lot ofcollage students go the those poor areas to offer aid education without any pay.
    Aid education is g good phenomenon that eve pay more attention to those kids who don't have the condition to learn .Aid education is right for this .It calls on people to do something to promote the kids'condition .Maybe,aid education can not solve the problem.However,it is a symbol which is inspiring us to help them and also informing us that there're still many kids who can not learn. 
    Last summer,some of my classmates parficipaee in aid education .They event to a very poor place called Jingzhai .After they came back,they told me what impresed them and I was impressed as well ."Kids are eager to learn "they said,"It's really a pity that you haven'tgo  with us ".I  am regretting that I haven't do them a favor.I thinks there should be more people involved in such activites so that those kids could be given more chances.

    Every year ,thousands of college students are encouraged to go to less-developed area for aid education .It has become a good way for students to use their knowledge to help society.
    Aid education is a successful route to improve students' ability.On one hand,aid education makes up the lack of education resources in poor area.Students who participate in it can use their knowledge to help those children .It's a good way to solve the unbalance in Chian education college students are easy for children to accept as they may have more commons than ordinary teachers.Young students can also bring new things these children have never seen before.On the other hand ,students' horiten are widen. Communication with these poor children will cause some meditation of  problems in society that will never happen in a university.It's a golden opportunity for students to adopt lives in socity.
    As I see it ,aid education will color my experience and it should count more support from citizens .I will undoubtfully participate in it if there's a chance.
