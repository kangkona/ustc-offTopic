    Every year, many high school students are enconraged to give aid education in poor areas
in China.They don't complain but just want to let more children to have educatin.
    Aid educatioon is not a new word now.Atlthough our country is becoming more and more    
prosperious,there are still many children in mountain or poor areas cannot get the 
education they deserve .The reason is obvious.First,they don't have enough money.Second,veey 
few teachers want to live there.Third,most people there don't regard education necessary.So 
many warm-hearted students get together to give aid education to those poor children.
    I preciate this kind behavior.And of course,it needs people's support and the government's 
awareness.And of possible,Iwill be glad to be one of those students who give aid education in 
poor areas.
<start>     Every year,a lot of college students are encouraged to do aid education in undeveloped areas.
As one of the volunteers of the onion "fang cao",I know that four new students will go to the 
west this year.What's more ,we have twelv graduaters in Ninxia for two years now .
     It's no doubt that aid education is of great importance .For those who are born poor ,the only
 way to improve living level is education. Aid education give them love and knowledge ,small but 
valuable.For those who just graduated,it's an opportunity to show his talent as well as make 
contribution to those poor children.They will learn what is most valuable in life.
     I think everyone should have this experience for long or short .Never can one just see the rich .
never can one just waste life ,never can one forget those children with strong desire to learn .Just 
do it and you will learn what you can't get in textbooks.
<start> In the modern society, there are a lot of college students who are encouraged to go to the poor 
villages to teach the children that live there and that can not afford the study.
     According to some books and papers about college students'going to the poor counties to teach,
it is very important to the development of our motherland.It can increase the development of the native 
education.At the same time,It makes a contribuation to improving the public knowledge level.
     As I see it,It is not only good for those poor children but also can train our college students that 
they go to the villages to help those children.The reason is that college students can add large amouts
of experience about how to live,work,communicate with others and even begin their own careers.What's more
,the college students can also find their own problems and study how to correct it during the course.
Therefore,from the standpoint of mine .It not only benifit for the children but also for the college            
students.
<start>     Each year,thoutands of college students are encouraged to aid education in poor area in China. Despite
frustration and hard ships,most of them find it meamhyful and helpful.
     From the standpoint of me,I support thisaid very much.This activity not only give these students a 
great opportunity to make contribution to our country's education,but also makethem feel that they are a 
part of the souety and must share the responsibility to give all the children a better life.
     In the process of aiding education,they will learn what it is like in poor area .They have to live the
 same poor life like their poor little students for a short time, which most of them would never see in big
 cities.They also can learn communication skills during teaching those kids.My sister once took part in an aid.
After she returned,she changed a lot .You can feel she is more polite and kinder to people.She would be 
stronger and positive whem facing difficalties.She even keeps helping those kids she told by writing letters 
to encourage them.I think that is what changes aiding education could bring to these college students.
     In a word, we should all take part in aid education if possible for the fate of these poor kids as well as    
ourselves
<start>    Nowadays,we live better as our country become powerful.But a few part of China are still poor .To develop those part of China,Aid Education appears.
    Every year, many students in colleges are couraged to go to those poor location to to becomea teacher.They help to develop their education.They give the children much new conception that the kids never heard.They bring hope to those boys and girls.
    Besides,it is meaningful for these students who take participate in Aid Education.Through Aid Education,students experience the poor life and then they would know how luchy they are. Maybe they will change a lot .Some bad manners will be dropped.
    For my own part,so,Aid Education not only can help those poor part in our country,but also it is a great experience for these students.It is meaningful for all of us.   
<start>    Yearly,many college students are encouraged to aid education in poor areas.
     Education is a very important part of a country.Every successful country put emphasis on education.Children are the future of a country.They bring new energy to the world.So their values and characters influence even control the world.
     The activity of aid education is of importance .Now,many college graduates can't find jobs in ig cities.So go to aid educatioon is a perfect choice for them.They are competent and their ability is not a waste.It's of good sence to the country.
     In my eyes,our country should insist on encouraging college students to aid education.Since our education level is very low in some poor areas.Our country should take measures to award the college students who are wiling to go to the poor areas.Because it's a big sacrifice.They use their youthand dreams to support our education.And they are faced with poor living conditions.
     So we should think their work is wonderful.We should understand them.
     I hope more and more college students want to go to aid education.I hope education in our country can be better and better.
<start>    Every year,a lot of college students are encouraged to aid education on the poor areas by school.Espcily in summer holiday.Many students start theirtrail to help the poor students.
    It's meaningful to aid education for those college students.First,most of them come from the city.They hardly know the develapment phenomon of the poor area.And it's a good chance to make them know these.Then,they can get connection with the socity .Aswe know,most of times of college students are spent on school live.They bave few chance to feel the socity.it's good for them on those Zone.Finally,the poor students can get so much thing from the things.they will get many knowlegd from college students.and be encouraged to hard work
    In my opinion,aiding education is a good things for college students and local students.It create many chance to feel socity for college students.It should be encouraged.
<start>    There years,it has become a tradition for more and more college students to offer aid education to poor areas.They're inspired by the society and government to give back their knowledge and love to those who can not afford to enjoy qualified education .
    Since the education of poor areas is weak,aid education becomes a rain to a land which hasn't been watered everysince.aid education gives the poor kids a chance to know what knowlege is.At the same time,college students will also tastethe hapiness of helping others.
    I think aid education is necessary for our country because it's not only a way to improve education qulities,butalso reflects the spirits which our harmony society needs most-kind devotion and love.
<start>    Each year,most of college students will went to the remote place foreducatation.Because there are lot of little boys and girls live in that place were need help.Their family not enough money to keep them for school.
    By this lot of poor children can learn about some new things,and they can find them really faviourate and other way that college students can steel themselves,they will find him/herself can do well anything if they do it by heart.
    In my opionion,This was but also good for that children,and a good playground for college students to make themselves more strong.If I have a change to do this,I will go first.

   There are more and more students going to the poverty places to help teach the children in China now.And the government is always encouraging the college students to take part in this activity.
   As we all know ,the aid education not only helps the poor children but also benefits to the aid teachers---the college students.of course,it helps the development of the education especially in the poor places.It is all known that our country lacks the  teachers especially the high-educated teachers.Then the college student is the best teacher of this kind.They could teach the children the newest knowledge.What is more,they could exercise themselves at the same time on the speeching communicating confidence and the rest!In a word,the aid education benefits both sides.
   In my opinion,the meaning of aid education is more important than itself .Because it tells the college students have the hot heartand are positive to join the activities which are very good to the public .And these spirits are priceless! 
<start>    Every year many college sstudents are inspired to aid education in these poor areas of China.
    It is meaningful to both the individuals and our country.We,college students,are living a colorful life and most of us need not worry about our everyday needs such as food,choth and so on .But what about the students in the poor areas?They bave to help support their family.They don't bave big classrooms.They never think about mordern equipment in the classroom.They also don't care about sharing books.All the things they may not care about.Because all the things can not decrease their desire for knowledge.But many teachers don't want to teach in these poor areas for the low wages and bad condition.So the college students are necessary.They bring knowledge to the kids and also send them the message that our country cares about them.
    As I see it,it is meaningful to aid education in poor areas.We can teach the kids better.Usually,they get a mixclass that is all the grades are taught by one teacheer in the same classroom.Also ,we can bring more attraction to the area to make it better.What's more,we can also gain our experience and improve our thought.So,why not?
<start>    As we know,education is the future of a country.Many countries are strong enough because people in these countries have good situations to study knowledge they want to know.
    To be a member of these strong countries,China can't fall behind in education .So many students graduated from colleges are encouraged to help teaching in many poor parts of China.Every year,a large quantity of college students take part in this encourageous activity.
    For many of them ,helping teaching is a chance to give thanks to our country,give thanks to their parents or just for examing themselves.But for these poor countries.children there can have the right to write,to read and to listen.These may help them do more to creative more chances to make their lives beautiful.
    Surely,as a college student,I'm willing to give a hand to this.Maybe we can't get benefits from it soon,but after a long time ,we may see the big change in China.That is,everyone can do help to our country because we are well educated.Maybe one day ,I will be a part of this team.
<start>    These years,many college students are encouraged by the goverment to teach in poor area,where teachers are lacked of.For our school ,students are often sended to Haiyuan,Ningxiaprovince.This activity is called Aid Education.
    The Aid Education is a good thing for the students of poor area without doubt.For poverty,those students often can't get enough education.Also,the activity is good for the poor area.The knowledge is the most valuable wealth at all.That activity is also a good matler for the society.It reduces the pressure of the job market.
    In my opinion ,aid education is also helpful for the helpers.That experience may help them know more and deeper about China and think more about the life.The Xu Benyu is just such a sample.I think it's rather good for college students to make a right attitude to life and society.
<start>    As we all know,many high school students are encouraged to aid education in poor area every year.This activity is significant.
    First,many students can know the important role they play in the society;they can also be trained,get to konw the sititution of education in poor are.Secondly,the activity can help to improve the education in poor area,also, those students will bring hope and new idea to poor area, not only knowledge. The children in poor area will be happier and feel be loved.Thirdly,the activity promotes love of our society,many people may feel it is necessary to care the poor area,thecountry may give more help to the poor area .
   In the eyes of myself,we should promote this activity to all the country,to all high school.We should weat it as our career.Of course,we must keep and improve the quality of this activity .Just do it!We will have a better society!
<start>    Because of various reasons, such as economy difference,the resourse of education doesn't distribute equally in every district.The lack of teachers and equipment for education in poor place is serious.So every year many students in universites are encouraged to give aid education in poor place .
    The action of students giving aid education help the children in poor place to know more about the world outside and learn more knowledge.This action can also improve the communication between teachers in poor places and university studernts .Besides,university students can improve their social activies and also know more about the need of education of poor places.
    From my viewpoint ,this activity is thoroughly meaningful for it is not only good for the education in poor places but also the university students.We should contime this activity and try our best to make it better.It will be an bonor for us to have a chance to participate in this activity.
<start>    Every year many college graduates are admired to educate in poor areas.
    In this way ,children in poor areas can get good education and can somehow change their fate.If they aren't able to get the good education,they have to continue what their parents do:live in poor condition and have children with poor education and have bad circle .When college students go to the rural areas,they bring some good thoughts there.Which can change mind of children and make them encouraged to make up their mind to make a good living .
    As far as I see it ,aid education is nothing bad  and can exercise college graduates' characters.But if they work there in their whole life,that is really something cruel.Because they may not have enough money to make a good living and reach their initial goal.Aid education should exist,in my opinion,and the graduates should be changed.That is to say graduates work there for only a few years and then be raged a position in a company or something else.
<start>    Every year ,there appears that many students time universities are encouraged to aid education in poor places as voluntiers in china.In a word ,it is a good photomena.
    Not only does it provide a good chance to train themselves in social life but also it does some help to China's education while the aid education becomes  so usual now .Tirsty,students can experience more and suffer more.At the same time ,they can make the best advantages of knowledge they have learnt in school and share them with others.Secondly,it makes their life more wonderful and challenging. As we know,it is more difficult to explain and express something you know to others dearly but rightly than to study and acquire it .At last,it provide abantant educational resurs such as knowledge and teachers how the poor places where many people can not afford enough money to pay how education .Evenly where people have no fund to luild a schooly and to have teachers.So aid education lings much hope to many poor children in mountains.
    I hold much hope in aid education.And I also have strong desire to participation aid education .I can experience much as well as make friends with many lovely children .We can living them knowledge,books,new information,especilly hope and love.
    As a students,especially a colledge students,it is the time we do our duty to our cournty and I think aid education is the best choos.
<start>   The education in China is not cuerage very much .For most time ,Do city children can get the best teachers and educational metential ,but our boy can't get into good schools . In our villige ,chare is a shot chat bave only one teacher,thirty students from grade One to grade Six .Ovn country is still poor nowadays ,so she can not give too much money for these areas.Under this situation,the government suggests the students that graduated from the colleges teaching the poor children in poor areas as aid Education.
   After this suggestion ,every year,there are many students from colleges go to the poor places as aid teachers.They know they are the members of the family that called China.
   This action has many benefits of diffirent aspects.First,they can spport the better education for the poor students.Second,they bring many educational machines for the school.Tirtd,there are rich students,they can bring westgation for the poor areas .The last one ,they can take the information to the all over the China.
   In my opinion ,I support this action .Because I am also a poor student from the northwest of China.I know the situation there.I wish there are more and more people support it.
    
<start>    As the development of society in China,people focus more and more on poor areas .And each year,a lot ofcollage students go the those poor areas to offer aid education without any pay.
    Aid education is g good phenomenon that eve pay more attention to those kids who don't have the condition to learn .Aid education is right for this .It calls on people to do something to promote the kids'condition .Maybe,aid education can not solve the problem.However,it is a symbol which is inspiring us to help them and also informing us that there're still many kids who can not learn. 
    Last summer,some of my classmates parficipaee in aid education .They event to a very poor place called Jingzhai .After they came back,they told me what impresed them and I was impressed as well ."Kids are eager to learn "they said,"It's really a pity that you haven'tgo  with us ".I  am regretting that I haven't do them a favor.I thinks there should be more people involved in such activites so that those kids could be given more chances.

    Every year ,thousands of college students are encouraged to go to less-developed area for aid education .It has become a good way for students to use their knowledge to help society.
    Aid education is a successful route to improve students' ability.On one hand,aid education makes up the lack of education resources in poor area.Students who participate in it can use their knowledge to help those children .It's a good way to solve the unbalance in Chian education college students are easy for children to accept as they may have more commons than ordinary teachers.Young students can also bring new things these children have never seen before.On the other hand ,students' horiten are widen. Communication with these poor children will cause some meditation of  problems in society that will never happen in a university.It's a golden opportunity for students to adopt lives in socity.
    As I see it ,aid education will color my experience and it should count more support from citizens .I will undoubtfully participate in it if there's a chance.

Beijing - Nearly 71 percent of China's fatal hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) cases were reported in rural areas, giving a clear sign of the huge rural-urban medical gap, the Ministry of Health said on Thursday.
The ministry vowed to further enhance medical responses, particularly in vast countryside areas, to curb the raging epidemic.
As of June 22, the common viral epidemic among children has sickened nearly 987,779 on the Chinese mainland. Of that total, 537 died. The majority of those who have gotten ill are younger than 3, said Wang Zijun, deputy director of the emergency response office under the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, at a press conference.
The epidemic control situation is grave in the country as the number of deaths caused by the disease stood at only 186 in the same period last year, Wang said.
"Rural doctors, who are less experienced than their urban counterparts in treating the infection, are finding it difficult to make timely diagnoses of the infection, with no lab screening capacity at grassroots-level facilities," said Lu Lianhe, veteran infectious disease doctor of the Beijing Ditan Hospital.
A late diagnosis might delay the effective treatment for the disease, which, in rare cases, can cause deadly complications like encephalitis, he said.
Usually, the infected person recovers without medication in seven to 10 days, experts said.
Relatively poor awareness of public hygiene and medical care among the rural population is also to blame for the higher fatality rate there, Wang said, urging parents there to practice better hygiene.
Among the fatal cases, about 92 percent were caused by entero virus 71 or EV71, which, like other strains such as the polio viruses, coxsackie viruses and echo viruses, can cause the disease, Wang said.
To address that, the CDC planned to introduce a quick test kit for EV71 among rural doctors to help facilitate early detection, according to Wang.
"Early detection and treatment is the key to averting death," he said.
Also, the ministry has been busy training all rural doctors in the nation for better HFMD response, said Yang Jinrui, deputy director of the ministry's information office.
The task will be completed by the end of June, according to Yang.
Previously, treatment guidelines for HFMD had been distributed to all medical facilities across the country.
In truth, apart from an unbalanced outbreak response between rural and urban areas in China, the long-existing gap in health conditions of minors is also widening, experts warned.
The prevalence of stunted growth among rural children younger than 5 is 17.3 percent, nearly four times that of urban children, official statistics show.
"And the gap shows no signs of shrinking," said Song Wenxiu, division director of the National Working Committee on Children and Women under the State Council.
Also, they are more susceptible to incidents such as the fake milk powder, she said.
