Private Tutoring1 Nowadays, because of the bad grades of their children, more and more parents try to let tirtles[fm1, tutors] to make up[wd2, make up for] it. They think it is a good way to improve their children's grades. But wheather[fm1, whether] it's right is in doubt. 
Some people hold the view that it is helpful. Children can learn more in they[sw, the] way. What more[s2, what's more], they can be taught face to face, which make[vp2, makes] easier to find what they don't know.
But others disagree with[wd2, to] it. They think it is a weast[fm1, waste] of both of time and money, they can learn what they need from their teacher[np1, teachers].[sn1]
There is no need spending so much money to teach[wd2, in teaching] what they have been taught again.
As far as I concerned[wd2, I'm concerned], I think it's unnessuary[fm1, unnecessary]. If we pay attention to what our teacher have taught us and spend enough time, we can get good grades easily. We shouldn't spend extra money.
