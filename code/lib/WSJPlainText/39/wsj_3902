Airgas Inc. said it completed the sale of Jackson Products Inc., a safety products maker, to Jackson Acquisition Co. for about $70 million. 

Airgas said it expects after-tax proceeds of about $49 million, including $6 million of long-term debt assumed by Jackson Acquisition, a new corporation controlled by H&M Group, a Dallas investment company, and H&M's principals, Robert B. Haas and James N. Mills.
Airgas said the sale was in line with its long-term strategy to emphasize gas distribution.
The Radnor, Pa., company said proceeds will be used to pay down debt and continue acquisitions in the industrial gas distribution business. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Airgas shares closed at $22.25, up 25 cents.
