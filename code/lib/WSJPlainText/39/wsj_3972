Rexene Corp. said it will consolidate or eliminate about 135 jobs, reducing its work force by about 10%. 

The maker of plastic resins and petrochemical products said that eliminating the jobs is expected to cost it about $1 million and should save about $12 million a year.
Rexene said jobs will be eliminated at its Dallas headquarters and its Odessa, Texas, manufacturing plants. 

The company said the move resulted from its recent recapitalization, in which it borrowed about $500 million to pay a special $7 a share dividend.
