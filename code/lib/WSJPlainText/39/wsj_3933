First Financial Management Corp. said it signed a letter of intent to acquire Atlanta-based Microbilt Corp. in a stock swap valued at $130 million, after Microbilt's proposed acquisition by H&R Block Inc. fell apart. 

The companies said the terms of the agreement call for Microbilt shareholders to receive 0.435 share of First Financial, also based in Atlanta, for each of the eight million shares of Microbilt outstanding. 

They said the transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests and is subject to approval by both boards and by Microbilt's shareholders. 

On Friday, Microbilt announced that plans to be acquired by H&R Block in a deal calling for Microbilt holders to receive stock valued at $18 a share had hit a snag.
Microbilt also said it had received an unsolicited offer from another party. 

First Financial is an information services company that provides data processing services for various clients, including banks and other financial institutions.
