Preussag AG said it will issue new shares after a special shareholders meeting in December to help finance its planned acquisition of the Salzgitter steelmaking and engineering group from the West German government. 

Preussag Chairman Erwin Moeller wouldn't disclose the volume or the price of the planned stock offering.
A Preussag spokesman separately confirmed that Bonn's asking price for Salzgitter would be around two billion marks ($1.06 billion). 

News of the stock dilution and skepticism over the move pummeled Preussag's shares in Frankfurt stock exchange trading yesterday, where they dropped 18 marks each, to close at 317 marks.
Preussag, a West German metals, energy and trading concern, is roughly equal in size with Salzgitter.
Their combined annual sales approach 27 billion marks. 

Bonn's plan to sell Salzgitter to Preussag isn't expected to raise any antitrust objections, and it is assured easy passage by the West German parliament.
