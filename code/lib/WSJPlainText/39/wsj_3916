Eurotunnel PLC said it likely will turn to shareholders together with its creditor bankers to raise the funds needed to meet the escalating costs of its English Channel tunnel project sometime in 1990 or 1991. 

The Anglo-French group said talks with its banks since it announced extensive cost overruns in July have yet to produce a final agreement on a new financing package but are expected to do so by early next year. 

The company said about 75% of any additional funding is expected to come from the banks, with the remainder "probably coming from a rights issue in 1990 or 1991, possibly supplemented by subordinated debt." 

The difficulties lie in reaching agreement with the banks and Eurotunnel's chief contracting party, TransmancheLink, on a forecast of costs. 

Eurotunnel estimates the cost to complete the project at #4 billion ($6.48 billion), raising the total cost of the project to #6.96 billion.
Transmanche-Link estimates #4.27 billion will be needed to complete the project, while technical advisers to the creditor banks estimate another #4.6 billion will be needed. 

In late July, when Eurotunnel first publicly acknowledged it would need more money for the project, its shares were trading close to #10.
On London's Stock Exchange, Eurotunnel shares closed yesterday at 650 pence, down from 695 pence Friday.
