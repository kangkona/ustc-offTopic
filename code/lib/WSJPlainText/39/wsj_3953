Groupe AG, Belgium's largest insurer, said first-half premium collections were up by more than 10% from the year-earlier period and that financial income had increased by 11%. 

As a result, AG said, the company expects 1989 earnings to exceed 1988's, allowing a dividend increase and increased allocations to reserves.
Last year's dividend was 130 Belgian francs ($3.30) a share, up from 115 francs in 1987. 

Technical charges, relating to claims and commissions, were lower than in the year-earlier first half, AG said.
Operating costs had risen during the first half, in part because of the integration of French insurance company Euralliance, acquired earlier this year.
Higher personnel costs and start-up charges related to new information systems also boosted costs. 

AG said its balance-sheet total climbed by more than one billion francs as of June 30.
