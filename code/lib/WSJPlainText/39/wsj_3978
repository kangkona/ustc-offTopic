CSX Corp. said third-quarter net income fell 27% because a coal-miners strike and a weak industrial economy decreased the company's overall traffic. 

The Richmond, Va., transportation company said service disruptions and damage caused by Hurricane Hugo also contributed to the earnings decline. 

Net was $94 million, or 91 cents a share, compared with $120 million, or 75 cents a share, a year earlier.
Per-share figures reflect a stock repurchase program launched in October 1988. 

Rail operating profit declined 55% to $110 million, from $170 million.
The drop resulted mainly from declines in almost all commodity groups, including coal. 

Revenue was flat at $1.89 billion. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, CSX closed at $35.25 a share, up 62.5 cents.
