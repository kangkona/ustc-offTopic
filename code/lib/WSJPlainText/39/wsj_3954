General Homes Corp. said it signed a new credit agreement with its senior secured lenders to restructure about $250 million in debt. 

The Houston-based homebuilder said the agreement, part of a larger debt restructuring, calls for the old loan to be replaced by a $100 million revolving loan, a $90 million amortizing, term loan and a $60 million non-amortizing term loan. 

General Homes also is seeking to exchange about $140 million in subordinated debt for a new issue of convertible preferred stock.
If that offer is successful, General Homes will amend its new credit agreement to allow it to issue stock instead of paying interest on the $60 million loan. 

All the new loans will mature Sept. 30, 1994, but will be payable on demand until the proposed exchange offers for the subordinated debt are completed.
