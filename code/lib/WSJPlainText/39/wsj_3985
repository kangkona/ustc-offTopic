Audi of America Inc. lowered base prices of its 1990 luxury cars as much as 5.5%, or $2,100, in hopes of reviving its lagging sales. 

However, some of the impact of the cuts may never reach consumers, because the Volkswagen of America Inc. unit reduced prices for dealers less than it cut prices for consumers.
As a result, Audi dealers said they will have less of a margin to swing deals.
Audi of America and Volkswagen of America are units of West German auto maker Volkswagen AG. 

Audi officials said prices on 1990 models dropped an average of 8.2% compared with prices of comparably equipped 1989 models.
Audi added air bags on its 1990 cars and leather upholstery as a standard feature on some models. 

Here's how the pricing works: The base price for a 1990-model Audi 200 Quattro is $35,805, or $2,100 less than the $37,905 1989 base price.
That works out to a 5.5% price decrease.
The price of a 1989 Audi 200 Quattro equipped with features standard on 1990 models would have been $38,475, making the comparably equipped price reduction $2,670, or 6.9%. 

But Audi dealers said the price they pay for the car fell just $1,170 to $29,763 from $30,933.
That dropped the margin on each 200 Quattro $930 to $6,042.
In the past, when companies have cut dealer profit margins on cars, the dealers often made up the difference by trying to sell more add-ons to consumers.
Some Audi dealers said they'd accept the lower margins, however, if the move helped improve sales. 

Audi is likely to sell about as many cars this year as the 22,936 cars it sold last year.
At its peak in the U.S. market, in 1985, Audi sold 74,241 cars. 

Audi officials told dealers at a meeting in Dallas last week to expect smaller rebates in the coming year as a result of the price cuts.
Audi officials also said they expect to sell 2,500 cars a month in the model year that began yesterday.
Still, they cautioned that Audi may need to shed about 100 of its 365 U.S. dealers who have lost interest in the franchise.
