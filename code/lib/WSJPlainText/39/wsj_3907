President Bush has named Edward Fleischman acting chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a post he will occupy until the president's nominee for the job is confirmed. 

The president previously nominated White House aide Richard Breeden to become the SEC chairman.
The Senate Banking Committee has held hearings on the nomination, and is expected to recommend soon that the full Senate confirm Mr. Breeden. 

Mr. Fleischman, a current SEC member, will succeed David Ruder, who is departing from the SEC.
