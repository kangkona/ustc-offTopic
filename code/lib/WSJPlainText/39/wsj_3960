MLX Corp., Troy, Mich., said it is negotiating with 12 senior lenders to possibly restructure $188.5 million in debt held by its refrigeration and air-conditioning group.
The company said the debt was accumulated during its acquisition of nine individual businesses that make up the group, the biggest portion of which was the 1986 purchase of a Hillman Co. unit. 

MLX has said it formally requested a rescheduling of a $21.1 million payment due yesterday by the group. 

MLX said it made the request in light of its Securities and Exchange Commission filing to issue $120 million in subordinated notes and warrants with a 10-year maturity.
The company said its existing debt comes due in 1994.
MLX and its lenders agreed to a two-week delay of the $21.1 million debt payment to explore a restructuring.
