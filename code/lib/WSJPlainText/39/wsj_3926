Score another one for Voyager 2. 

Photos from the robot spacecraft, analyzed a month after it skimmed past Neptune, show a geyser on Neptune's moon of Triton tossing material five miles outward. 

The discovery makes Triton only the second world outside Earth where active geysers have been confirmed.
Voyager photographed eight geysers on Jupiter's moon of Io in 1979 shooting sulfur nearly 200 miles above the surface. 

The photograph also is a triumph for Lawrence Soderblom, a scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey and a member of the Voyager scientific team.
In late August, a few days after the best Triton photos were received on Earth, he suggested what he called the "crazy idea" that Triton may have frozen geysers that spew nitrogen crystals and organic compounds high above the surface.
The most recent photos show that his idea wasn't so nutty after all. 

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., the NASA center responsible for Voyager, said the plumes from the geyser rise vertically about five miles, then form a cloud that drifts 90 miles westward in Triton's winds.
