Newsweek Inc. named Don Durgin, a former president of the National Broadcasting Co. network, vice chairman of the weekly news magazine. 

Mr. Durgin, 65, succeeds Gerard Smith, who is leaving the company and who until last year was publisher of Newsweek. 

Mr. Durgin's appointment marks the second major change at Newsweek recently.
Last week, Newsweek's parent, Washington Post Co., appointed Alan Spoon as president, a post that had been vacant since the departure of Christopher Little last January to become president of Cowles Magazine Inc. 

Newsweek said Mr. Durgin will oversee "client development" and other business departments.
Mr. Durgin has been a consultant to the office of the president at Newsweek since March 1988.
Before that, he was executive vice president at Dun & Bradstreet Corp., where he was responsible for the company's magazine and broadcasting operations. 

He was president of General Electric Co. 's NBC network from 1966 to 1973.
Later, he was president of McCaffrey & McCall Inc., an advertising agency. 

Gerard Smith had been publisher from July 1985 to September 1988, when Howard Smith, who isn't related to him, was named to succeed him.
During his tenure, the magazine went through a weak U.S. ad market and severe cost-cutting measures.
