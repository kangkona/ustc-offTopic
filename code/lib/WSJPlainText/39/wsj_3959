Anchor Savings Bank shares fell 7.4% in heavy over-the-counter trading after the Hewlett, N.Y., banking concern disclosed that its president and chief operating officer, William G. Schneider Jr., submitted his resignation Sept. 20. 

In a proxy statement, Anchor said Mr. Schneider resigned, effective in two months, because his duties had been reduced by a recent reorganization.
The proxy said Mr. Schneider feels that under his employment contract he is entitled to about $960,000, or about three times his annual salary, plus full pension and retirement benefits.
Mr. Schneider couldn't be reached for comment. 

Martin Coopersmith, first senior vice president, said the bank hadn't determined whether Mr. Schneider's duties were reduced or whether he is entitled to the compensation.
Mr. Coopersmith questioned whether the drop in the stock price was due to the resignation, saying, "We've had days like this before." 

Still, Mr. Coopersmith said, most Anchor Savings holders probably received their proxy statements Friday or Saturday.
Anchor Savings common fell 25 cents a share to $3.125 on volume of 200,000 shares, roughly triple its average daily volume.
