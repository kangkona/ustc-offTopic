The U.S. government filed a suit in federal court here to seek to collect about $15 million in back taxes from Bernard Cornfeld, a flamboyant founder of "go-go" offshore mutual funds who ran afoul of securities regulations in the 1960s. 

The suit seeks to reduce a number of tax assessments to judgment.
According to the government, Mr. Cornfeld owes back taxes for 12 years in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. 

The government said it hopes this week to obtain information on his assets but it hasn't yet found him to serve him with a subpoena to appear. 

Mr. Cornfeld is said to own homes in Paris, London and Beverly Hills.
In the late 1960s, he headed Investors Overseas Services Ltd., which had offices in 100 countries and $2.5 billion under management.
His company fell apart in the market collapse of 1968-70, and he was toppled in a corporate coup.
In 1973, the Swiss jailed him for nearly a year on fraud charges but he was acquitted in a 1979 jury trial.
Mr. Cornfeld couldn't be reached for comment on the current suit.
