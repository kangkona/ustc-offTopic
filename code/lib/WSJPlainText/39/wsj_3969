Tokyo stocks closed easier as profit-taking and futures-related selling wiped out the session's early gains in a wide range of issues. 

In London, shares were moderately lower in thin trading on continued fears that higher interest rates are coming, a concern that weighed down many other European markets as well. 

Masami Okuma, a senior trader in Tokyo for UBS Phillips & Drew International, said Japanese institutional investors were on the selling side of the market as the second half of the nation's fiscal year began because they wanted to lock in profits before buying more shares. 

Several rounds of arbitrage selling also lowered the index, traders said.
The Nikkei index of 225 issues, which declined 53.22 points Friday, fell 13.79 to 35622.97.
Volume on the first section was estimated at 750 million shares, compared with 943 million Friday.
However, advancing issues outnumbered declining issues 608-386, with 139 unchanged. 

The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the first section, which gained 6.04 points Friday, was up 1.36, or 0.05%, to 2703.58. 

In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index eased 33.65 points to 35589.32. 

Among losers Monday were blue-chip electricals, which were sold on profit-taking, traders said. 

Pioneer Electronic was down 80 yen to 5,250 yen ($37.77) a share, and TDK lost 60 to 5,700. 

Financial issues were lower.
Sumitomo Bank fell 90 to 3,450, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank lost 40 to 3,450, and Mitsubishi Bank slipped 10 to 3,200. 

Securities issues ended generally easier as investors decided to pocket some of last week's gains.
Some also were sold after opposition political parties suggested raising taxes on capital gains, a trader said. 

Nomura Securities lost 40 to 3,230, and Yamaichi Securities fell 10 to 1,860. 

Other losers included pharmaceuticals. 

Sankyo lost 40 to 3,190, Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical fell 30 to 3,870, and Mochida Pharmaceutical was down 40 to close at 3,850. 

Real estate issues ended mixed.
Some continued to attract investors interested in their property holdings, but others were sold on profit-taking. 

Sumitomo Realty Development was up 30 at 2,200, while Mitsubishi Estate was down 10 at 2,480. 

Textiles were among the gainers as their growing earning prospects and laggard status attracted investors, traders said. 

Kanebo gained 12 to 887 yen, Unitika rose 9 to 799, Nitto Boseki was up 20 at 1,010, and Kuraray ended at 1,670, up 10. 

London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, the most closely watched market measure, closed 10.2 points lower at 2289.2.
The narrower Financial Times 30-share index finished 8.8 points lower at 1876.9.
Volume was 403.8 million shares, compared Friday's already thin trading of 495.1 million. 

The market's early sharp losses were linked largely to ex-dividend trading in some blue-chip stocks.
The FT-SE 100's modest rebound over the rest of the session was attributed to some bargain-hunting after Wall Street opened higher.
But dealers said the market is still broadly pressured by concerns that U.K. interest rates may be about to rise further. 

They said the market's current focus on the West German central bank council's Thursday meeting is damping interest in stock trading.
The main concerns are over a potential rate increase by the Bundesbank that could then set off a flurry of similar moves by several other major industrialized nations. 

Dealers said yesterday's declines on thin volume were symptomatic of the market's current wait-and-see attitude, particularly with some market commentators now downplaying chances of an imminent rate increase in the U.K. 

Leading stocks that traded ex-dividend included Glaxo Holdings, which fell 25 pence to #14.64 ($23.72) a share.
Builder Tarmac dropped 1 to 288, electricals and cable concern BICC lost 7 to 507, and Rolls-Royce fell 2 to 181. 

Australian Mutual Provident bid 605 pence a share for British life insurer Pearl Group, valuing the company at #1.1 billion.
Pearl's shares surged 87 to 639.
Other life insurers gained as well, with Legal & General up 4 at 363 and London & Manchester Group up 10 to 314.
Sun Life, which was trading ex-dividend, rose at first but ended at #11.00, off 15 pence. 

Elsewhere around the market, Eurotunnel skidded 45 to 650 after the Anglo-French consortium said it probably will turn to shareholders and bankers to raise funds to meet the escalating cost of its English Channel tunnel project. 

Food retailer Polly Peck slipped 2 to 331 on its first day as one of the FT-SE 100 shares.
Volume was a light 390,000 shares. 

British clothing, textile and thread maker Tootal Group fell 1 1/2 to 127 after it reported only a 1% gain in interim pretax profit. 

WCRS Group, a U.K. advertising concern, rose 4 to 316 after it reported fullyear profit more than doubled.
The gain, which applied to a 14-month fiscal year because of a change of reporting dates, was largely attributed to the direct-marketing concern Carat Group Holdings, in which it holds a 50% stake and plans to buy more. 

In other European markets, Frankfurt shares rose in moderate trading, but the gains were pruned by caution ahead of the Bundesbank council meeting.
Fears of higher rates also were cited by many analysts and traders throughout Europe as prices fell in Paris, Zurich, Amsterdam, Brussels, Milan and Stockholm.
South African gold stocks closed lower. 

Elsewhere, shares declined in Taipei, Manila, Hong Kong and Wellington, were higher in Sydney and were mixed in Singapore.
The Seoul market was closed for a holiday. 

Taipei shares fell for the fifth successive session, and the decline was accelerated as the Weighted Index sank below 10000.
The index ended at 9911.15, off 269.69 points, or 2.6%.
