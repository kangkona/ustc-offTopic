Federal officials said it will cost the savings-and-loan industry about $42 million this year to underwrite the new agency that oversees S&Ls. 

Under the regulatory structure created in the S&L legislation enacted in August, thrifts will pay 1/315th of 1% of their assets to finance the operations of the newly created Office of Thrift Supervision.
The assessment will raise $42.3 million for the agency's operating expenses through the end of the year, and will establish a capital fund to offset future fluctuations in the assessment. 

For more than 60% of the industry, the assessment will be less than $5,000, said the Office of Thrift Supervision. 

The fee, which wasn't specifically set by the legislation, was roughly what industry officials expected, although they had braced themselves for other assessments. 

"This could go up," said James Grohl of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, a trade group based in Washington. "Every time we turn around, another shoe drops." Thrifts will also pay insurance premiums to the new Savings Association Insurance Fund, which will be 23 cents for every $100 in deposits beginning in January 1991.
