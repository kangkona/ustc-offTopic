Stone Container Corp., Chicago, said its Stone-Consolidated Inc. subsidiary plans to make a C$11.25-a-share (US$9.55) offer for the 20% of CB Pak Inc. common shares that it doesn't already own. 

Stone Container said a special committee of CB Pak's board had reviewed the C$46.5 million offer for CB Pak's 4,135,160 shares outstanding and determined that it was fair and should be accepted by the company's shareholders. 

Stone-Consolidated, previously named Consolidated Bathurst Inc., is a major Canadian pulp and paper producer that was purchased by paper products maker Stone Container in March.
CB Pak is a publicly traded unit of Stone-Consolidated, but it no longer has any active businesses, a Stone Container official said. 

Famcorp Inc., a holder of 100,000 CB Pak shares, said it wouldn't accept the offer.
Famcorp, the holding company of Montreal's Gagne family, said the C$11.25-a-share offer is "a rip-off," adding that a fair price would be about C$15 a CB Pak share.
