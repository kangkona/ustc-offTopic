The Canadian government introduced in Parliament a bill to extend Canadian laws to oil rigs and other marine installations on the continental shelf beyond Canada's 12-mile territorial limit. 

Canada currently has jurisdiction over only its natural resources in this area, the Canadian Justice Department said. 

The bill also extends provincial laws to offshore areas and extends Canadian criminal law to Canadian ships world-wide. 

Canadian criminal law will also apply to vessels in Canada's 200-mile fishing zones.
It would extend to offenses against Canadian-fisheries officials carrying out duties on foreign vessels. 

Justice Minister Doug Lewis said this provision will enhance Canada's "ability to protect Canadian-fisheries officers in our fishing zones and on the high seas in hot pursuit of suspected offenders." 

Other countries including the U.S., Britain and Australia have enacted similar offshore legislation.
