Optek Technology Inc. of Carrollton, Texas, said it expects to "roughly break even" for the fourth quarter ending Oct. 27 because of reduced orders and order delays. 

Revenue is expected to be $13.5 million to $14 million. 

The maker of opto-electronic parts and fiber optic equipment had net income of $519,000, or 17 cents a share, on revenue of $15.7 million a year earlier. 

The company said that higher costs and lower shipments related to its rearrangement of manufacturing facilities and processes in the U.S. and Mexico also contributed to the lower quarterly results. 

Optek also said that it expects its operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 1990 to be similar to the fourth quarter although it expects fiscal 1990 overall to be better than fiscal 1989. 

The company didn't project year end results, but it had net of $1.3 million, or 35 cents a share, in the first nine months on revenue of $43.8 million.
