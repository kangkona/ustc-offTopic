George E. Johnson's divorce settlement means as much to his career as to his marital status: He ceded his chairman's job and 61% of the stock in Johnson Products Co. to his ex-wife, Joan B. Johnson. 

Mrs. Johnson will be adding the chairman's job to the treasurer post she already holds.
The stock she'll receive is valued at about $5.5 million. 

Meanwhile, Eric G. Johnson, 37, son of the couple, was named chief executive officer.
He remains president.
A source close to the company said the son, in effect, has been managing day-to-day operations of the company for more than a year.
His father will remain a consultant. 

None of the principals in the change of command returned phone calls seeking comment. 

The 62-year-old George Johnson, who founded the company in 1954 with a $250 loan, leaves a troubled legacy.
In fiscal 1988 Johnson Products posted a loss of $3.8 million, or about 94 cents a share.
The company manufactures hair-care and cosmetics products aimed at the black-consumer market, including the Ultra Sheen and Classy Curl brands. 

Sales at Johnson, the nation's 18th-largest black-owned company, have eroded considerably since $40.9 million in 1983, mainly because of competition.
In 1988 sales totaled $29.1 million.
