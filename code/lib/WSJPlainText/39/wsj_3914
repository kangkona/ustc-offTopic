WCRS Group PLC, a U.K. advertising and communications concern, said pretax profit for the 14 months ended June 30 more than doubled from the previous year. 

In addition to the change in its reporting dates, it cited sales growth in Europe resulting from its acquisition of a stake in Carat S.A., a media-buying concern. 

Pretax profit in fiscal 1989 rose to #38.1 million ($61.7 million) from #18.3 million in the 12 months ended April 30, 1988.
Profit after tax, minority interests and extraordinary items, known as net profit attributable to shareholders, rose 25% to #13.7 million from #10.9 million. 

The company, which purchased a 50% stake in Carat in May 1988, didn't provide a full breakdown of that affiliate's contribution to its results.
But it said the contribution to pretax profit made by its European operations leaped to #30.3 million from #7.3 million.
It also said it is interested in increasing its stake in Carat.
