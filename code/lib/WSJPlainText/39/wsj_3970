The United Mine Workers union said it called a selective strike against six coal companies in West Virginia and Kentucky that it says are supplying coal to Pittston Co., which the union has been striking since April. 

The strikes, which began yesterday, were called at M&H Coal Co., War Eagle Construction, Auger Resources and GAR Mining, all near Mallory, W. Va.
Strikes were also called at Mine 29 Mining & Processing Inc. and Sun Glo Coal Co. near Pikeville, Ky. 

It wasn't immediately known how many workers were involved in the latest strikes.
