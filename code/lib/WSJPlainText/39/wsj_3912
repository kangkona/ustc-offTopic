Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. should be broken up to create more competition in the Japanese telecommunications market, says a report prepared for Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. 

The report proposes three options for an NTT breakup.
The ministry is expected to decide on how to proceed by the end of March. 

The first option -- to divide NTT into one long-distance company and 11 local-service companies -- would be most effective in encouraging greater competition and rationalizing NTT's operations.
But such a break-up would cost 300 billion yen ($2.16 billion), and of the 11 local-service companies, only those in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya would be profitable, according to the report. 

The second option -- breaking NTT into several regional firms -- wouldn't secure fair competition, the report said, because NTT's competitors in long-distance services would have to connect to their competitors' local networks. 

The third option -- to divide NTT into one long-distance and one local-service company -- wouldn't end the current monopoly on local services. 

The report said the second and third options would cost less than the first. 

Reacting to the report, NTT President Haruo Yamaguchi said deregulation of the market, and not a break-up of NTT, would best foster competition.
He said breaking up NTT would obstruct the smooth operation of digitalized networks and diminish the company's research-and-development capability.
