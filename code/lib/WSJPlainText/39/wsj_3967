Citing lower-than-expected orders, KLA Instruments Corp. said it expects to report earnings in its fiscal first quarter were about 15% lower than a year earlier. 

In the year-earlier quarter, the maker of industrial image automation systems posted net income of $2.8 million, or 16 cents a share, on revenue of $38.8 million.
KLA said it expects sales in this year's first quarter, ended Sept. 30, will be between $41 million and $42 million. 

The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company said orders for its printed circuit board inspection systems fell short of its expectations because of lower capital spending by U.S. makers of printed circuit boards.
