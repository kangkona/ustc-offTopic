Motorola Inc., in a bid to cut expenses, said it plans to trim its work force by about 2,500 workers, or 2.4%, and will take a $43 million pretax charge to cover costs associated with the move. 

The Schaumburg, Ill., maker of electronic equipment and semiconductor chips, which has 105,000 employees world-wide, said the staff reductions will be centered in its semiconductor and communications-equipment segments. 

"We retain our confidence in the company's growth prospects," said George Fisher, chief executive officer and president. "This program simply reflects what we at Motorola consider to be good and prudent management." Motorola said the payroll-reduction program "emphasizes enhanced voluntary severance primarily for salaried employees." The early-departure package will be restricted generally to employees in U.S. operations, starting immediately and running until mid-November.
Motorola has about 65,000 workers in the U.S. 

For the first six months of this year, Motorola had net income of $277 million, or $2.13 a share, on sales of $4.56 billion. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Motorola shares slipped 62.5 cents to $57.125.
