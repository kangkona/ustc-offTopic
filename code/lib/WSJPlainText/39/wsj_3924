Standard & Poor's Corp. said it would add American Greetings Corp. Class A stock to its 500-stock index at the close of trading Wednesday.
Concurrently, S&P will delete Squibb Corp. 

The early announcement is S&P's first under an experimental plan designed to head off disruptions in trading resulting from changes in the broad-based index, which is widely duplicated by investment managers.
When stocks have been added to the S&P 500 in the past, a flurry of buy orders often forced the exchanges to halt trading because of an imbalance. 

S&P previously announced changes as it made them, after trading on Wednesdays.
The rating and publishing concern initially said it would announce changes a week in advance.
No spokesman was available to comment on the policy yesterday. 

Squibb, a Princeton, N.J., pharmaceuticals maker, has agreed to merge with Bristol-Myers Co. 

In over-the-counter trading yesterday, the Class A shares of Cleveland-based American Greetings closed at $32.50, up 25 cents.
