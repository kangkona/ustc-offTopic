MBIA Inc. said it agreed in principle to buy Bond Investors Group Inc., a closely held concern, for $275 million.
The two companies are municipal bond insurers. 

MBIA Chairman William O. Bailey said the company decided to buy Bond Investors "when presented with the opportunity" and recognized the "economies of administration we could realize." 

MBIA is the holding company of Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corp. BIG is the parent company of Bond Investors Guaranty Insurance Co.
The shareholders of Bond Investors Group include American International Group Inc., Bankers Trust New York Corp., Government Employees Insurance Co., Salomon Inc. and Xerox Credit Corp. 

Robert Barbanell, managing director of BT Securities, a unit of Bankers Trust, said the group decided to sell because of "differing views" among the members over the direction of BIG's business. "We didn't always have consensus on issues so we decided to sell when the opportunity came along," he said. 

He said the group would realize $50 million in premium over book value from the sale. 

MBIA said that in the first six months of this year it accounted for 37% of the insured new-issues municipal bond market.
BIG had a 13% share in the same period. 

Upon completion of the transaction, BIG's municipal bond insurance portfolio will be reinsured by MBIA.
The unearned premium reserve and contingency reserve from BIG will increase MBIA's capital base to $650 million from $565 million on June 30, and the policyholders' reserve will increase to about $1.5 billion from $1.2 billion.
The agreement is subject to regulatory approvals.
