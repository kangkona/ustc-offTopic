Former House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho, who resigned from Congress in July over a mishandled $7,000 profit on junk bonds, will become a managing director of a New York investment banking house at an annual salary reported to be near $1 million. 

Mr. Coelho is joining Wertheim, Schroder & Co. to handle what the company describes as major client responsibilities in investment banking and asset management in New York, London and Tokyo.
Mr. Coelho said yesterday that he also will be involved in Wertheim's mergers and acquisitions business. 

He said he will avoid lobbying activities. "I wanted a career," he said. "I'm determined to be as successful here as I was in the political world." 

Mr. Coelho zoomed to national prominence in the 1980s as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and assumed the No. 3 post in the party's House leadership in 

He abruptly ended his political career four months ago, saying he was doing so to spare his party and his family a prolonged ethics inquiry into a short-term profit he made in 1986 on a $100,000 investment in junk bonds underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
He conceded that he hadn't disclosed the transaction fully on personal financial reports and probably would have to pay back taxes and interest because he had claimed favorable capital-gains treatment to which he wasn't entitled. 

He blamed the errors on his accountant. "In 1986 I didn't even know what a junk bond was," he said then. 

Yesterday, Mr. Coelho said Wertheim is hiring him for his experience in national affairs -- 13 years as a legislative aide and 11 as a House member. "They are interested in me bringing to the table my perspective . . . . Twenty-four years are in my computer," he said.
