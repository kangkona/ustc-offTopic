FileNet Corp. of Costa Mesa, Calif., said its third-quarter net income was about $120,000, or one cent a share, well below analysts' expectations of $2 million to $2.5 million, or 19 cents to 26 cents a share. 

The maker of document image processing equipment blamed the lower-than-expected earnings on delays in concluding contract negotiations with several customers and delays installing ordered equipment for some customers. 

Revenue for the quarter was about $18.5 million, below analysts' forecasts of $22.5 million to $23.5 million. 

For the year-earlier third quarter, FileNet had a net loss of $2.2 million, or 22 cents a share, on revenue of $12.6 million. 

FileNet said it expects to report third-quarter results by Oct. 23.
