Donald E. Nickelson, president of PaineWebber Group Inc., will retire after 22 years at the brokerage firm and its predecessors. 

Mr. Nickelson's role at PaineWebber had been trimmed recently and his retirement was expected.
Mr. Nickelson, 56 years old, gave up significant day-to-day responsibility in March 1988 when he left the presidency of PaineWebber Inc. and became president of the parent holding company. 

"I just decided I wanted to do something else, even though I don't know what that something is," Mr. Nickelson said. "My only immediate plan is to go fishing in Argentina." 

Although PaineWebber didn't announce Mr. Nickelson's retirement, Donald B. Marron, PaineWebber chairman and chief executive officer, told officers in an internal memo that Mr. Nickelson will retire effective Jan. 31.
He said Mr. Nickelson had "made outstanding and unique contributions to the management of our firm" and would be missed. 

PaineWebber said Mr. Nickelson will continue to serve on the PaineWebber board, and, under an agreement previously disclosed in regulatory filings, become a $22,916-a-month consultant to the firm until he is 65.
Mr. Nickelson is also a board member at Braniff Inc. and other firms in which PaineWebber has been involved as an investment banker.
But Mr. Nickelson said, "I think over time I'll phase out of most of my PaineWebber-involved boards." 

A PaineWebber spokesman said the PaineWebber Group presidency won't immediately be filled.
He said David Gallitano, a 41-year-old executive vice president, would assume Mr. Nickelson's responsibilities for running the firm's merchant banking operations.
