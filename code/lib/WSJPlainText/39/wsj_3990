Is the Clean Air bill being Bowenized?
In 1987 HHS Secretary Otis Bowen sent Congress a "modest" proposal on catastrophic-health insurance coverage and Congress promptly loaded it with costly add-ons, plus a financing surtax.
It now appears that the House wants to similarly "strengthen" the Bush Clean Air bill by requiring cars sold anywhere in the U.S. to comply with the super-strict pollution requirements of smog-ridden California.
We can't imagine that rural America will much like paying more for already-expensive new cars because the environmental lobby in Washington thinks the air in Houston and New York has too much nitrogen oxide.
If indeed the Bush administration is conceding Congress carte blanche on this legislation, we may all end up paying for a catastrophically expensive clean-air law.
