British clothing, textile and thread maker Tootal Group PLC said conditions in international textile markets remained difficult during its latest half year, as it reported a 1% gain in interim pretax profit. 

Last June, Tootal consented to a friendly #395 million ($639.7 million) takeover from a much larger textile group, Coats Viyella PLC, but the linkup between the two has been put on ice for the moment as the U.K. Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigates the possibility that the combination of the two companies' British thread interests could be anti-competitive. 

In the six months ended July 31, profit before tax rose to #19.2 million from #19 million in the year-earlier period. 

During the interim period, sales rose about 6% to #254 million from #238.8 million a year earlier. 

Meanwhile, profit attributable to shareholders, or profit after tax and minority interests, rose 4% to #13.3 million from #12.8 million a year earlier.
The company took no extraordinary or exceptional items in either reporting period.
