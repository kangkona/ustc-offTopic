Hammond Co. said Fidelity National Financial Inc. agreed not to purchase any more of the mortgage banker's common stock through Oct. 12. 

Fidelity, Irvine, Calif., has increased its stake in Hammond, Newport Beach, Calif., to 23.57% in recent months.
Statements made in Securities and Exchange Commission filings prompted Hammond to ask for a standstill agreement.
In national over-the-counter trading, Hammond closed at $5.875 a share, up $1.50. 

Fidelity's stock purchases are for investment only, said Bill Foley II, president and chief executive officer of the title-insurance underwriter, "although we want the Hammond Co. to receive our input." Mr. Foley, elected a Hammond director in July, said Fidelity and Hammond continue to have a "very friendly relationship." 

Fidelity didn't agree to the standstill but did agree to meet with Hammond this week and also said it wouldn't make further Hammond stock purchases for a two-week period, which began Friday.
