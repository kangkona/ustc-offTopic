American Airlines said it ordered six Airbus Industrie wide-body planes with options to acquire six more in a transaction valued at approximately $642 million. 

The addition of six A300-600R and options on six additional jets would increase American's fleet of the aircraft to 37.
The planes will be delivered in 1991 and 1992.
American, a unit of AMR Corp., Fort Worth, Texas, said it plans to fly the planes in the Caribbean and return some wide-body DC-10s for use in the U.S. 

The airline wouldn't disclose the price, but industry analysts say it paid approximately $53.5 million each.
The planes will be powered by General Electric Co. CF680C2 engines. 

As part of an aggressive fleet expansion plan, American has ordered 251 jets and put options on another 308 from manufacturers including Boeing Co., Fokker Aircraft and Airbus.
In all, American will spend $14 billion on new planes by 1994 if it exercises all the options.
