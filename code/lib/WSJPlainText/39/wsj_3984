Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. said it sold an office building complex in Paris for about $600 million to an international group of investors headed by Kowa Real Estate, a unit of Industrial Bank of Japan. 

Kaufman & Broad, a home-building concern, and Banque IndoSuez are joint-venture partners, with Kaufman & Broad responsible for development of the project. 

The site, near the Champs Elysees, is the French headquarters of Shell Oil Co. Kaufman & Broad, which sells its commercial real estate projects in France prior to development, said it believes this sale is the largest single commercial real estate transaction in French history. 

The project will consist of a renovation of two existing facades, which will be retained to preserve the historical significance of the current building, and the construction of five buildings totaling 560,000 square feet and five levels of subterranean parking.
The site is 2.2 acres, and will be called Washington Plaza. 

Construction is scheduled to begin in December 1990, when Shell moves out of the existing building, and will be completed by the spring of 1993.
Buildings in the complex will have floor sizes averaging 11,000 to 14,000 square feet. 

Bruce Karatz, president of Kaufman & Broad, said that offices in the project will be constructed around patio gardens.
With this sale, the company will have sold more than $1.3 billion in commercial real estate in France over the past four years, he said.
