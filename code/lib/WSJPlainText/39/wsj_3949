Stung by shrinking sales, Hyundai Motor Co. 's U.S. unit said it is scaling back operations by eliminating 50 jobs and leaving unfilled 11 open positions. 

Hyundai Motor America, based in Garden Grove, Calif., said it was forced to cut its number of employees because staffing was based on projected sales of 300,000 cars a year.
Now, though, the company said projected annual sales have been reduced to 200,000 cars.
The company put a freeze on hiring in June. 

The cuts represent at least 8% of Hyundai Motor America's 600 employees from its administration and support staff.
A company spokesperson said that about 40 workers voluntarily accepted a severance package and the rest were discharged.
The company wouldn't disclose terms of the package. 

Through the first eight months of this year, Hyundai sold 132,440 cars in the U.S., down 33% from a year ago.
