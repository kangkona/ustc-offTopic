Armstrong World Industries Inc. said two affiliates of the Belzberg family of Canada and two other shareholders are seeking to amend the Lancaster, Pa., company's articles of incorporation regarding shareholder rights. 

Armstrong said the Belzberg family, which acquired a 9.85% stake in the maker of coverings and building products in July, is attempting to have the company adopt provisions that would make "certain sections" of the new Pennsylvania corporation law inapplicable. 

The company is seeking to allow shareholders with a stake of 10% to propose amendments to its articles of incorporation and to allow holders with a 20% interest to call a meeting.
The new law doesn't allow such actions to holders with those stakes. 

A company can amend its articles of incorporation to avoid parts of the new law. 

An Armstrong spokesman said the company is examining the matter.
