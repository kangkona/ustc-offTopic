Consolidated Capital Equities Corp. said it filed a plan of reorganization in bankruptcy court and hopes to emerge from proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code before year end. 

The Dallas real estate investment company, which manages real estate limited partnerships, said its general, unsecured creditors will receive 49% of the stock in the reorganized company, plus proceeds from a $3.5 million note issued by an employee stock ownership plan, which will own 51% of the company. 

The unsecured creditors, by far the biggest creditor group, are owed about $33.2 million. 

Consolidated Capital, a unit of Consolidated Cos., once was one of the nation's largest syndicator of real-estate limited partnerships, but was battered by changes in tax laws that made tax shelters unattractive.
Consolidated Cos. also is operating under Chapter 11 and isn't a part of Consolidated Capital's reorganization. 

Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate but is protected from creditors while it tries to work out a plan to pay its debt.
