James G. Bellows, a former executive editor of the syndicated program "USA Today on TV," has filed a $1.8 million suit alleging he was fired without warning or cause by the program's producer, GTG East, a subsidiary of GTG Entertainment. 

Mr. Bellows was fired last week; he joined GTG, a co-venture between Gannett Co. and former National Broadcasting Co. president Grant A. Tinker, in November 1988. 

Mr. Bellows declined to comment on the suit.
His attorney, Michael Zweig of New York-based Loeb & Loeb, said, "My client was terminated without warning on Sept. 26," adding that Mr. Bellows has one year remaining on his two-year contract. 

GTG said it doesn't comment on matters in litigation. 

In the suit, filed in federal court, Mr. Bellows also alleged that he "supplied the idea and format" for a new show that GTG is producing for syndication, said Mr. Zweig.
The show Mr. Bellows said he submitted was called "Star Track," a celebrity-driven program. 

GTG recently announced it was producing "Celebrity Update." 

Mr. Bellows was hired by GTG East as a savior for its first effort in syndication, "USA Today on TV," which had been touted by its creators as a sure-fire hit for the 1988-89 television season.
The show immediately had problems, however. 

Mr. Bellows, a former managing editor of the successful syndicated TV show "Entertainment Tonight" and editor of the Los Angeles Herald Examiner and the Washington Star, was brought in to rescue the show.
But GTG replaced Mr. Bellows five months later. 

Since March, Mr. Bellows, 65 years old, has been working on unspecified projects at GTG East's New York headquarters.
