Stocks finished higher because of late buying generated by computer-guided program trading strategies and a flight to some big blue-chip shares that investors consider safe from earnings disappointments. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 20.90 to 2713.72, a sharper gain than Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which closed 1.72 higher at 350.87.
Big gainers in the industrial average were Philip Morris, which gained 2 to 166 5/8; Procter & Gamble, which jumped 1 1/2 to 121 1/2, and DuPont, which added 2 1/4 to 122. 

Other industrial average stocks also rose after corporate announcements.
Coca Cola gained 1 1/2 to 68 1/2.
The company said it would post a $530 million gain in the fourth quarter on the sale of its 49% stake in Columbia Pictures Entertainment.

USX closed up 1 3/4 to 34 7/8 after announcing plans to sell certain oil and natural gas assets. 

Another factor boosting the industrial average was program buying in the Major Market Index, a 20-stock measure that includes 17 of the 30 stocks in the industrial average.
Traders said Drexel Burnham Lambert, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley executed arbitrage buy programs at about 3:30 p.m. EDT. Prices of Major Market futures rose to a premium, allowing program-trading companies to lock in profits by buying stock and selling the overpriced Major Market contracts. 

For all that, trading was sluggish.

Other blue chips contributing to the rise in the industrial average included Eastman Kodak, up 1 5/8 to 48; Westinghouse Electric, up 1 1/8 to 68 5/8, and General Electric, up 1 1/4 to 57 3/4.
