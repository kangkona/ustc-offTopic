Citing a slump in personal computer sales, Businessland Inc. said it will report lower-than-expected sales and earnings for its first quarter ended Sept. 30. 

The company's stock plunged 12% yesterday in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, despite the fact the announcement came after the market closed.
The shares closed at $11.875, down $1.625. 

The drop in the stock price was an indication that word of the disappointing quarter had leaked out. "The rumor mill flies fast and furious in this industry," a spokeswoman said.
She noted other computer retailers are also experiencing softening sales, and said she couldn't speculate further on the reason for the stock decline. 

The company said it expects to report sales of about $310 million in its first fiscal quarter, down from previously anticipated sales of more than $320 million.
Net income, on a per-share basis, is expected to be between 14 cents a share and 17 cents a share, the company said.
As of June, the company had about 33 million shares outstanding, indicating net income of between $4.6 million and $5.6 million. 

Even if the company meets the high end of that range, the results will still represent a sharp decline from the year before, when Businessland posted net income of $7.5 million, or 25 cents a share, on revenue of $272 million. 

Businessland considers the results an anomaly -- a temporary slowdown while buyers evaluate recently introduced products. 

The company said it sees continuing strong demand for high-end computers, and "hopes to be back on plan" in the current quarter. 

Apparently, last Friday's resignation of Businessland's chief financial officer, John Russell, has prompted some concern among analysts.
The Businessland spokeswoman said Mr. Russell's resignation, after about six months on the job, had "absolutely nothing to do with" the lower-than-expected results.
