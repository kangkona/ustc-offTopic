American Health Properties Inc. said it completed a $21 million participating first mortgage loan to Four Winds Chicago Limited Partnership, owner of the Four Winds Chicago Psychiatric Hospital of Lemont, Ill. 

American Health, a Los Angeles real estate investment trust specializing in health care facilities, said it expects to advance an additional $14 million to complete the remaining phases of the hospital project.
Four Winds opened the initial 60-bed phase of the 165-bed hospital in June.
The loan calls for payment of base interest plus a participation in the revenue growth and value appreciation of the hospital. 

American Health also said it has agreed to construct and own a $12.5 million, 60-bed free-standing rehabilitation hospital in the Dallas suburb of Plano.
