Laidlaw Transportation Ltd., Burlington, Ontario, said it acquired 10 firms in the waste services area, two landfill sites and three school bus concerns.
Terms weren't disclosed. 

Laidlaw said the acquired assets, which are in the U.S. and Canada, together with new transit contracts, will add more than $100 million to the company's annual revenue, which reached $1.18 billion in fiscal 1988. 

Laidlaw, 47% held by Canadian Pacific Ltd. of Montreal, is North America's largest school bus operator and third-largest waste services concern.
