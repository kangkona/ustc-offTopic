Rochester Telephone Corp. said it expects to report that third-quarter and fourth-quarter operating results trailed year-earlier periods and said it will report "somewhat lower" year-end operating profit than 1988. 

"Consolidated expenses will be higher than anticipated as a result of certain nonrecurring expenses, including legal fees," the company said, adding also that revenue has been below its projections. 

In the past year, Rochester Telephone, which serves more than 570,000 lines, mainly in Western-Central New York, has acquired or announced agreements to acquire nine Midwestern telephone companies -- five in Illinois, three in Wisconsin and one in Indiana. 

The company said it had previously projected moderately higher 1989 earnings from operations, but because of competitive pressures and expenses associated with the acquisition program, gross margins are expected to be lower.
