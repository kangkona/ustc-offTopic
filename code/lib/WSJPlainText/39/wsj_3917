The Securities and Exchange Commission accused a broker who formerly worked at Merrill Lynch & Co. and at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. of stealing $500,000 from his clients and using at least $131,000 of the money to pay gambling debts. 

In a civil suit filed in federal court in Manhattan, the SEC asked the court to force Marc Stuart Weiner to disgorge the money he allegedly misappropriated from 15 clients' accounts.
The lawsuit says that Mr. Weiner transferred $99,000 to his own account and that he benefited directly or indirectly from the transfer of the rest of the money to other accounts. 

Joseph Ostrowsky, an attorney for Mr. Weiner, declined to comment, saying he hadn't seen the lawsuit. 

The alleged fraud and securities-law violations began in April 1986, and the coverup continued into early 1988, the SEC said.
Mr. Weiner was a broker in the Forest Hills, N.Y., office of Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. from June 1983 through August 1987.
He worked at Prudential-Bache from August 1987 through April 1988. 

A spokesman for Merrill Lynch said the company discovered discrepancies in the accounts of Mr. Weiner's former clients after the broker joined Prudential-Bache.
Merrill Lynch then notified regulators and law-enforcement agencies, as well as Prudential-Bache.
The spokesman added that Merrill Lynch has resolved all customer complaints related to the matter. 

A Prudential-Bache spokeswoman said the firm had cooperated with the investigation and that no money had been taken from Prudential-Bache accounts.
She wouldn't say whether Mr. Weiner's resignation from the company was related to the SEC investigation.
Prudential-Bache is a subsidiary of Prudential Insurance Co. of America. 

The amounts allegedly stolen from Mr. Weiner's clients at Merrill Lynch ranged from $5,000 to $120,000.
The SEC said $120,000 was stolen from Maria Maier, an elderly widow, who invested $200,000 with Mr. Weiner.
The SEC alleges the broker invested only $80,000 and deposited the remaining $120,000 in other accounts, including $90,000 to pay gambling debts. 

When Ms. Maier received her monthly account statement, she noticed that only $80,000 had been credited to her account.
But the SEC says the broker assured her the money was invested and safe.
