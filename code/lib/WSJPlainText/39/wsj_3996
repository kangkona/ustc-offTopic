West Germany is selling 48% in Deutsche Siedlungs' & Landesrentenbank (DSL Bank) for 408.7 million marks ($218.4 million), launching the largest initial public-stock offering of the year. 

The West German government will offer 2.1 million shares in DSL Holding AG at 195 marks ($104.21) each to the public between Wednesday and Friday, lead manager Dresdner Bank AG said.
DSL Holding, which was set up specifically for the public offering, holds 48% of the wholesale and commercial bank, while the government and several regional states have 52%. 

The partial sale of West Germany's 16th-largest bank is the first major public offering since May 1988, when the government sold its remaining 60% interest in aluminum, energy, and chemical concern Viag AG. 

The government's net receipts from the offering will amount to only 250 million marks.
A total of 150 million marks will be used for a capital increase at DSL Bank, and another nine million marks will go into the reserves of the holding company. 

The complex holding company construction will permit DSL Bank to maintain its public-sector status, which gives the bank a better credit rating and allows the placement of debt instruments with government guarantees.
