Corvus Systems Inc., citing losses from its overseas subsidiaries, reported a net loss of $1.4 million for the fiscal-fourth quarter. 

The troubled maker of computer products, operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankrupty Code, had a net loss of $3.8 million in the year-earlier period.
Sales for the quarter ended May 31 fell 12% to $3 million from $3.4 million. 

Timothy R. Larkin, president and chief executive officer, attributed the results primarily to losses incurred by its French subsidiary and to write-offs of investments in its French and Canadian units. 

For the year, Corvus had a net loss of $2.8 million compared with year-earlier net income of $2.3 million, or eight cents a share.
The most recent year included an extraordinary credit of $179,000 resulting from early extinguishment of debt and tax-loss carry-forwards. 

In 1988, net included an extraordinary credit $930,000, or three cents a share, from tax-loss carry-forwards.
Sales for the year declined 41% to $15 million from $25.4 million a year ago. 

Corvus, which filed for Chapter 11 in June 1988, said year-end results were affected by lower customer sales resulting from uncertainty because of the filing.
Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditors while it works out a plan to pay its debt.
The company also said year-end results were affected by price reductions on products in response to increased competition. 

Corvus said its stock was delisted from Nasdaq because it no longer satisfied capital requirements, although it said the stock would continue to be listed on the National Daily Quotation Service pink sheets published by the National Quotation Bureau.
