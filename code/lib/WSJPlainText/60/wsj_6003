LONDON - Britain's current account was in deficit by a revised #4.86 billion ($7.59 billion) in the second quarter, the U.K. Central Statistical Office said. 

The revision reflects a slight widening of Britain's trade surplus in services, particularly in tourism, and a narrowing of the surplus in interest, profits and dividends.
