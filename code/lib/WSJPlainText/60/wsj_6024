Scientists at the University of Washington and at the Oncogen division of Bristol-Myers Co. said they developed a live genetically engineered vaccine that protected macaque monkeys against infection by simian AIDS virus. 

Four animals immunized with the vaccine were exposed to the simian AIDS virus, and all four have remained healthy and virus-free throughout a 32-week follow-up period.
Three of the study's four non-vaccinated control animals became infected within two weeks.
A fourth control animal remained uninfected. 

While other scientists, notably polio pioneer Jonas Salk and Ronald DesRosiers of Harvard University, have recently reported strides in animal vaccine development, Oncogen said its work represents another kind of first. 

"We believe that this is the first live, recombinant vaccine that protects primates against a retrovirus that causes AIDS-like diseases," said Shiu-Lok Hu, who is director of vaccine research at Oncogen and the senior author of a report on the work published in the current issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
He cautioned that the findings aren't directly transferrable to human AIDS, but said the methodology offers promise for further research. 

The study animals were innoculated with two doses of vaccine spaced 16 weeks apart, and then exposed to live simian AIDS virus 12 weeks after the second innoculation. 

The vaccine, called v-senv5 splices together part of the virus's protein coat to the vaccinia or cowpox virus, long used in smallpox immunization. 

Scientists said the advantage of a live, recombinant virus vaccine is that it continues to offer protection even when exposure to the virus occurs long after immunization.
