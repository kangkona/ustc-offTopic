Last year, 4.2 million Americans between the ages of 16 and 24 dropped out of high school and failed to get a diploma, for a dropout rate of 12.9%, the Education Department reported. 

This figure -- the so-called status-dropout rate, which measures the number of people who left high school before graduation and failed to get a diploma by age 24 -- is down from 16.2% in 1968.
But Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said the dropout rate is still too high. 

Last year, the dropout rate was 35.8% for Hispanics, 14.9% for blacks and 12.7% for whites.
Since 1968, the dropout rate for blacks has fallen by nearly half, a substantial improvement. 

The National Center for Education Statistics reported the new figures in its first report on dropout rates, as required by Congress in a law passed last year. 

Preparations for President Bush's education summit with the nation's governors later this month in Charlottesville, Va., is generating support for the establishment of national education goals, including a significant reduction in the dropout rate. 

The 12.9% dropout rate differs sharply from many reports that cite a dropout rate of 25%.
The higher figure refers to the proportion of 17-year-olds who haven't graduated from high school, and doesn't take into account people who finish school after age 17.
