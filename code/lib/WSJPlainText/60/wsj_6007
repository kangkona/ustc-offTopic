Canada's merchandise trade surplus widened to 1.03 billion Canadian dollars (US$869 million) in July, partly as a result of a drop in imports of automotive products, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said. 

The July surplus was the largest since a surplus of C$1.10 billion in January.
The June surplus was C$222 million. 

The July decline in automotive-product imports was attributed to a 3.9% drop in new motor vehicle sales in Canada during the first seven months of the year.
