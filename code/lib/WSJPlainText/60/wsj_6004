The Italian government expects inflation to ease to a year-on-year rate of 5.5% by December, down from 6.8% in August, and reach an average of 4.5% in 1990, according to a senior official. 

The projection is part of the annual Economic Forecast and Planning Report, which the government will present to Parliament by the end of this month with next year's budget proposal. 

According to the draft report, gross domestic product (GDP) will grow a real, or inflation-adjusted 3.5% in 1989 and slow marginally to a 3.2% growth rate in 1990. "The economy is no longer showing the signs of overheating it did at the beginning of the year," the official said.
The economy expanded by 3.9% in 1988.
