Norton Opax PLC, a specialty-printing company, said it will allow its hostile #688 million ($1.07 billion) offer for De La Rue Co. to lapse. 

Norton, which itself is subject to a #382 million bid by Bowater Industries PLC, said it realized the linkup with De La Rue wasn't going to receive shareholder approval at an annual general meeting scheduled for today, chiefly because Bowater has recently lifted its stake in Norton to 29.9%. 

Norton also said it entered into discussions with Bowater which may "lead to a recommendation of those offers." Previously, Norton fiercely resisted Bowater's takeover overtures. 

In trading on London's Stock Exchange, Norton shares rose two pence each to 219 pence; Bowater rose two pence to 503 pence, and De La Rue fell nine pence to 338 pence. 

Norton's announcement helps resolve the three-cornered takeover battle, by removing De La Rue from the fray. 

Bowater is involved in several different activities, ranging from printing and packaging to engineering. 

Bowater bought a 25% stake in Norton earlier this year from British Publisher Robert Maxwell, with the view to "develop both companies." However, when Norton bid for De La Rue without soliciting Bowater's advice, Bowater decided to thwart the move by bidding for Norton.
Analysts say Bowater is likely to succeed in its bid.
