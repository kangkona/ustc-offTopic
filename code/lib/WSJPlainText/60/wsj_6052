Fingerprints that remain invisible to present developing techniques can be made visible with a method devised by a cell biologist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. 

The U.S.-owned lab said latent fingerprints, palm prints and footprints can be developed on plastic, metal, paper, glass, and porous and non-porous surfaces with a technique invented for the Secret Service by George Saunders. 

Mr. Saunder's technique "led to the arrest of a criminal suspect for the first time in March," the laboratory said. "Palm prints were developed on a blank government check stolen from a military facility in Pennsylvania," it said. 

The print-developing method is based on a technique biologists use to stain proteins.
The surface holding a latent fingerprint is washed for about 30 minutes in a buffer solution of citric acid that contains suspended particles of gold.
An image begins to emerge as the gold particles are electrically attracted to the proteins of the fingerprint.
The print is then bathed in a silver solution that highlights the gold particles.
The technique works on the original surface and on a print "lifted" from the surface on a nitrocellulose membrane. 

The method can develop prints on adhesive tape used to wrap drugs, counterfeit money and bombs.
It also can develop on computer disks, credit cards, bullet cartridges and wet paper. 

Both the Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are now using the technique, the lab said.
