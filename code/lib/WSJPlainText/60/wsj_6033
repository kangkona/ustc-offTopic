Maxicare Health Plans Inc. said the U.S. Bankruptcy Court here granted a preliminary injunction to restrain health-care providers from billing consumers directly for medical services that are the financial responsibility of Maxicare. 

"This will ease the concerns of our customers, the employers.
Further, it should accelerate our efforts toward reorganization," said Peter J. Ratican, Maxicare's chairman and chief executive officer. 

Maxicare, a Los Angeles-based owner and operator of health maintenance organizations, has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection since March.
Maxicare said it is prohibited by law from paying claims filed before the bankruptcy action until the court approves the company's reorganization plan, which Maxicare expects to make public within a month.
Under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, a company is shielded from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay off its debts. 

The injunction applies to all providers who render services to members of any of Maxicare's 33 health maintenance organizations, and it applies to those that don't have any formal contracts with Maxicare, the company said.
However, the ruling doesn't limit the right of providers to petition the bankruptcy court for relief from the injunction if they can show undue hardship.
