News Corp., the Australian media company controlled by Rupert Murdoch, said it bought 50% of two Hungarian newspapers, its first paper publishing venture in Eastern Europe. 

Terms weren't disclosed for the investment in the Budapest newspaper company, which remains half owned by Hungary's Credit Bank and other investors there. 

Reform, the nation's first independent weekly tabloid when it was launched last year, has circulation of 380,000.
Mai Nap, a daily paper started in February, has circulation of 80,000. 

Mr. Murdoch said in a statement that publishing in the eastern bloc is "a most interesting step."
