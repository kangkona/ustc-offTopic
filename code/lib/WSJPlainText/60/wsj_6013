In his Aug. 23 letter, Robert Russell concludes that a decline in college-completion rates is due to exorbitant increases in higher-education costs in the past 10 years.
Price increases at many institutions have topped the inflation rate for the past six years, but the increases are economically justified. 

Our largest cost component is labor.
According to the Education Department's 1988 Education Indicators, faculty salaries have actually eroded relative to inflation over the past 20 years.
Faculty salary increases were minimal or nonexistent during the 1970s, when inflation was rampant.
We are attempting to right this wrong now.
There are several other expense items that have outpaced inflation, including employee-benefits costs and technological changes. 

We also find that talented faculty and potential faculty are looking to business careers for the "hefty" salaries Mr. Russell claims exist in higher education.
More ominous are the forecasts of a diminishing number of faculty members.
The time may arrive -- and justifiably so -- when significantly higher faculty salaries will be required just to continue operating. 

The cost of a degree has escalated, but so has university-funded financial aid.
At Transylvania, 70% of the students receive some form of financial aid. 

Finally, noneconomic factors also play a major role in why students drop out.
Our annual surveys of students who don't return cite reasons ranging from illness to boredom to broken hearts.
And yes, some do indicate financial problems are to blame -- but not in sufficient numbers to support the claim that we lose scholars to dollars.
