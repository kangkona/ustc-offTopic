Synbiotics Corp. said it received approval to market nationally a vaccine against feline leukemia virus. 

The vaccine, called VacSYN/FeLV, has been marketed in California under an intrastate license for a year by its owner, closely held Bio-Trends International Inc., West Sacramento, Calif. 

The action by the U.S. Department of Agriculture will allow Synbiotics to market the vaccine to veterinarians in the rest of the country under a licensing agreement with Bio-Trends.
Synbiotics also has a licensing agreement to market the vaccine world-wide, except in Latin America, when it receives approval. 

Synbiotics develops and makes antibody-based products that prevent, treat and diagnose diseases.
