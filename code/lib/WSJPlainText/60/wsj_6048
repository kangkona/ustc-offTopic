From an interview in PR Reporter with Frank Mankiewicz of the public-relations firm, Hill & Knowlton: 

The notion of public relations as a profession is as absurd as bartenders calling themselves "mixologists." A profession is a skill -- PR is not.
Lawyers, accountants and doctors can be good PR people.
All that's required is a sense of public opinion.
A profession has standards and schools.
The Public Relations Society of America's PR degrees, all of it's silly.
If a person has a PR degree, all it indicates is that he wasted a lot of time that could have been spent studying worthwhile subjects like history or economics.
It's about as useful as a degree in astrology.
Well, maybe not quite that bad.
