The government's foreign exchange office said gross foreign exchange trading volume in Italy averaged an estimated $15 billion a day in April. 

The office was issuing results of a survey of 22 major Italian banks about their activities in the foreign exchange market.
A comparison with other surveys showed that the Italian foreign exchange market was equal in size to the one in Canada and just behind the Dutch market, which had daily volume of $16 billion.
The British foreign exchange market, with a daily turnover of $187 billion, was by far the world's largest.
