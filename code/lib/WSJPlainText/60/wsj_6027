Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second largest car manufacturer, said it plans to build a major production plant in southwestern Japan. 

Nissan officials said the plant in Kyushu, the country's southernmost main island, will be equipped with a "flexible manufacturing system" capable of producing a variety of models. 

They declined to provide details, but a local news report said the plant will have a capacity of 240,000 cars a year.
Construction, at a cost of 50 billion yen ($341.7 million), will start before the end of this year, and the plant will go into operation in the autumn of 1991, it said. 

Officials said Nissan decided to build the facility to prevent a possible decline in output as the company upgrades aging production lines.
Nissan has five production plants in Japan, but the lines in some of those near Tokyo are becoming outdated, they said. 

"Though domestic demand is strong, this isn't designed to boost production," one Nissan official said.
Car sales in the Japanese market are continuing to climb rapidly, though exports have become sluggish since many Japanese auto makers have started building cars overseas.
