Thank you for your page-one story on groundless child-abuse charges as a growing national problem (Aug. 23). 

Recently, when it was known that I would be a candidate for governor of Florida, I became the victim of a fraudulent child-abuse complaint.
I thus have firsthand knowledge of the ridiculous state of child-abuse investigations in Florida.
Anyone can make an anonymous phone call, and this call serves as a pretext to invade your home, even if the complaint is flagrantly frivolous and groundless, or motivated by malice as was the situation in my case. 

You are not allowed to know who filed the complaint, or what the factual basis of the complaint is.
Rather than knuckle under to these Gestapo-style perversions of the law by Florida officials, I chose to fight, and we are joined in battle.
As a retaliation, Florida officials appeared before a judge secretly, and procured a bogus arrest warrant to seize my small children (ages 3 1/2 and 5 1/2).
Obviously, as a candidate, I have significant resources to throw against the child-protection mafia, but what of parents without my resources?
As documented in your article, the average parent is at the mercy of the state. 

The great tragedy in all of this is that because of the fact that Florida officials pursue ridiculous complaints, legitimate complaints are underinvestigated.
There were more than 150,000 "hot line" calls last year.
The morning children's cartoon programs are full of "public service" ads agitating children to believe they may be victims of child abuse.
We are creating our own monster and, in the process, spreading resources too thinly that need to be focused on genuine crisis situations.
