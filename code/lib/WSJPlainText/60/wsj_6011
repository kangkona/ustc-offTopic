HCC Industries Inc. said a special committee of its board retained Bear, Stearns & Co. as its financial adviser in connection with a leveraged buy-out proposal from an investor group headed by some of the company's officers, and any other acquisition proposals that may surface. 

The management-led investor group is proposing to buy the 1.2 million common shares of HCC it doesn't already own for $8.50 each, or an indicated $10.2 million.
The maker of precision electronic parts has about 1.7 million common shares outstanding. 

Yesterday, in national over-the-counter trading, HCC common closed at $7.50 a share, off 25 cents on volume of 12,900 shares. 

Last month, HCC shareholders filed a lawsuit seeking to block the proposed buyout.
The suit is pending.
