Kroger Co. said it has reached agreements or is in discussions to sell 11 food manufacturing businesses which it expects will result in an after-tax gain of about $260 million. 

The businesses were earmarked for sale in January as part of the company's restructuring program. 

A letter of intent has been signed to sell eight of the businesses to a corporation to be formed by Eli S. Jacobs, New York City, and Engles Capital Corp., Dallas.
Included in the sale are North Coast Bakery, Delight Products, Kenlake Foods, Pontiac Foods, State Avenue, Tara Foods, K.B. Specialty Foods and Pace Dairy. 

Under terms of the agreement, expected to be completed by mid-November, the new owners will continue to provide Kroger with private-label products. 

Kroger also said it reached an agreement to sell its Meadowland Creamery in Conroe, Texas to Borden Inc. Negotiations are underway with Alpha Baking Co., Chicago, for the sale of Kroger's Gateway Bakery in St. Louis, as well as with an unidentified prospective buyer for its Heartland Farms Dairy in St. Louis.
