Bio-Response Inc. said it filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. 

The filing wasn't a surprise as the company said last week that it believed a Chapter 11 filing was imminent because of an inability to meet financial obligations to debenture holders.
Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditors while it works out a plan to pay its debt. 

More than 95% of its debentures outstanding were tendered for redemption by the company on Sept. 1 at an aggregate redemption price of about $22.4 million.
The biotechnology concern said it attempted to seek an arrangement with debenture holders that would permit the company to operate outside bankruptcy proceedings, but the firm said those efforts were unsuccessful. 

Bio-Response, which develops commercial applications of products derived from mamalian cells, said the filing wouldn't interfere with existing projects.
The company said it has a backlog of orders amounting to nearly $1 million. 

It also said it intensified its efforts to find a buyer for the company, but wasn't more specific.
