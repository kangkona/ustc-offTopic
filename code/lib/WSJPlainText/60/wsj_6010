Vestar Inc. said it received a patent covering the freeze-drying of certain liposomes. 

The process lengthens the shelf life of liposomes -- microscopic spheres made up of fat molecules -- that can be used to reduce the toxicity of certain drugs administered intravenously to treat cancer and acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 

Vestar develops drug delivery systems for diagnosis and treatment of cancer and AIDS.
It said its products are being tested in Europe but not yet marketed.
