Alpine Group Inc., aiming to cut interest costs, will offer a package of cash and securities for its $43.7 million debt outstanding. 

Alpine, a maker of specialty coatings and developer of information-display technologies, said that for each $1,000 face amount of its 13.5% senior subordinated debentures, due October 1996, it will offer $400 face amount of notes due March 1996, 10 shares of common and $175 in cash. 

The offer will be subject to holders' tendering at least 80% of the debentures; a total of $50 million of them was issued in October 1986.
Alpine would save some $2 million a year in interest costs if 80% of debentures are exchanged and $2.5 million if 100% are exchanged, said Steven S. Elbaum, chairman and chief executive officer. 

If all the debentures outstanding are tendered, Alpine will lay out $7.6 million of cash, $17.5 million of new notes and 436,000 new shares, resulting in a 9% total stake in the shares by the debenture holders.
Mr. Elbaum said the swap would expand the company's equity base by increasing the number of shares outstanding and by retiring the debentures below face amount, with the difference recorded as equity, Mr. Elbaum said. 

The new notes to be issued would be senior to any of the debentures that aren't tendered, Mr. Elbaum said.
In May, Moody's Investors Service Inc. cut its rating on the debentures to single-B-3 from single-B-2. 

Mr. Elbaum said the debentures are held primarily by institutions, though he declined to identify any major holders.
Alpine is confident that it will complete the swap, he added. 

In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Alpine common shares rose 12.5 cents, to $3.
