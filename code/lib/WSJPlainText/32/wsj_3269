Pakistan's Air Force has formalized its intent to purchase 60 General Dynamics Corp. F-16 A-B fighters powered by Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-200 engines, the two companies said. 

The transaction's total value is $1.4 billion, according to St. Louis-based General Dynamics, with the sale worth about $220 million to Pratt & Whitney, a unit of Hartford-based United Technologies Corp. Delivery of the aircraft is scheduled to begin in September 1992 and continue at the rate of 15 aircraft a year. 

The Pakistan Air Force also plans to upgrade the engines of the remaining F-16 A-B aircraft already in its inventory.
