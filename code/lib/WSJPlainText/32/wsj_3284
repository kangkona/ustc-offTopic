Help-wanted advertising, an indicator of future employment levels, slipped in August to a level substantially below a year earlier. 

The Conference Board's help-wanted advertising index fell to 148 in August, down two points from July.
In August 1988 the index, which uses a base of 100 in 1967, was 161. 

An economist for the nonprofit, industry-supported group waved off suggestions that the labor market is drying up. "Only a few short months ago, there was concern that the labor market in particular, and the economy in general, were heading for a slowdown, perhaps even a recession," economist Kenneth Goldstein said. "Subsequent economic readings confirm that the expansion is losing some steam but not enough to warrant concern about a recession." 

Volume of advertising, which is gauged in 51 major U.S. newspapers, rose in three regions and fell in six. 

In August, only 35% of newspapers had rising advertising volumes, compared with 63% in July and 49% in August 1988.
In June, 22% had rising volumes.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics's unemployment rate was static at 5.2% in July and August but off from 5.6% in August 1988. 

The steepest drop in August was 11.4% in the West South Central region, which includes New Orleans, Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Okla., and Dallas and San Antonio, Texas.
