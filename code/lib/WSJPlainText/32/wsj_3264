Renaissance Energy Ltd. said that it expects to report record results this year and that it should see cash flow and earnings levels rise about 25% in 1990 if oil and gas prices are stable. 

Ronald Greene, chairman and chief executive officer of Renaissance, an oil and gas producer, said in an interview, "In terms of 1989 cash flow and earnings, unquestionably, it (1989) will be our best year ever by a significant factor." He wouldn't offer a specific forecast, but he said an analyst's projection calling for net of 66 Canadian cents (U.S.56 cents) a share and cash flow of C$2.40 a share in the year ending Dec. 31 is "within the ballpark." 

Renaissance had 1988 net of C$7.9 million, or 27 Canadian cents a share, and cash flow of C$40 million, or C$1.56 a share, on revenue of C$86.2 million.
The company had first-half net of C$7.3 million or 25 Canadian cents, and cash flow of C$29.8 million or C$1.03 a share, on revenue of C$57.9 million. 

Mr. Greene said increasing production and higher oil and gas prices are behind the company's upbeat outlook.
For 1990, he said, "I'd say we'll be looking at a 25% increase in cash flow, in dollar terms, and roughly a 25% increase in earnings, predicated on an $18 price" next year for West Texas Intermediate crude, a benchmark grade.
Renaissance locked in an $18 price for its 1989 oil output last spring by selling forward its current-year production. 

Mr. Greene said that daily oil output should reach about 14,000 barrels a day this year and that natural gas production should be about 95 million cubic feet, up from a first-half average of 12,403 barrels of oil and 86.7 million cubic feet of gas. "For 1990, we're calling for oil production of just over 15,000 barrels per day and natural gas production of 135" million cubic feet, he said.
Renaissance's oil and gas properties are mainly located in southern and central Alberta. 

Mr. Greene said prices for natural gas, which have been depressed for years, are beginning to move higher and should bolster the prospects for Renaissance and other producers. "We are seeing a turning point" in gas prices, he said. 

He said the second-quarter increase Renaissance recorded in its average realized natural gas price, to C$1.45 per thousand cubic feet from C$1.31 a year earlier, marked the first year-over-year gain for the company in six years. "And we know that prices are higher on new contracts that we've signed, so for us, the price of gas has turned," he said. 

Next year, Renaissance expects to match or increase its 1989 capital spending budget of C$92 million, assuming oil prices remain stable, he said.
