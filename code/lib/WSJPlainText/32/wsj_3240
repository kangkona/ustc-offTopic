Hong Kong's government announced that the banking license of Wells Fargo & Co. has been revoked at its request. 

The San Francisco-based bank is to retain a representative's office in Hong Kong. 

Wells Fargo's local operations were sold to Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. in April at the same time it disposed of its Tokyo, Seoul and Singapore operations. 

A government official said Wells Fargo is scaling down its international business so as to concentrate on its business in California. 

Keith Wu of Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers HK Ltd. and Christopher Chong of James Capel (Far East) Ltd., banking analysts in Hong Kong, said there isn't any reason for Wells Fargo to hold a separate license since its operations have been absorbed into Hongkong Bank.
