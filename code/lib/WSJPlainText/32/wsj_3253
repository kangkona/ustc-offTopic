Himont Inc. said a special committee of directors unanimously found that Montedison S.p.
A.'s bid for the 19% of the company it doesn't already own is "not fair" to shareholders. 

In August, Montedison offered, for each share of Himont, $47 in cash and a warrant to purchase one share of Montedison stock, valued at $2, for a total of $49.
The Milan-based chemicals and pharmaceutical concern holds 81% of Himont, the world's leading supplier of polypropylene. 

Some Wall Street analysts said Himont's decision may force Montedison to increase its offer. 

"I don't think you'll see a lot of controversy in this," said Leonard Bogner, a Prudential-Bache chemicals analyst. "Montedison will raise its bid." 

Mr. Bogner expects Montedison to raise its offer to about $50 a share to $53 a share.
Although, he adds, "I would quibble that $55 is really a fair price." 

In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Himont shares closed up 87.5 cents, at $48.375.
