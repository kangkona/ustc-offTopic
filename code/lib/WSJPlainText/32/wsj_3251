Tokyo share prices dropped sharply Friday amid fears that the Bank of Japan may have to follow the latest round of European interest-rate increases. 

London shares ended slightly weaker but well above intraday lows as the market rallied on takeover speculation. 

Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 stocks fell 313.64 to close at 35209.35 in moderate trading.
The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of first-section issues lost 17.61 to 2659.38.
Volume on the first section was estimated at 700 million shares, compared with 910 million Thursday.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers 656-334. 

In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei index rose 69.95 points to 35279.30. 

Analysts said investment trusts were the big sellers Friday and that brokers tried to support the market during the afternoon.
Last month, investment trusts reportedly were heavy buyers, so many of them are starting to unwind their positions, analysts said. 

There was speculation that the Bank of Japan might decide to raise its discount rate over the weekend in the aftermath of Thursday's round of rate rises around Europe, led by the West German Bundesbank.
But many analysts said they think the central bank will wait a little longer before making a move. "They only have one shot and they want to do it right," said David Keller, head of equity research at Credit Lyonnais Securities (Japan). 

Still, Mr. Keller and other analysts said, the Bank of Japan is worried about inflationary pressures building up as the Japanese economy grows and companies face labor and capacity shortages.
The official discount rate currently stands at 3 1/4%. 

Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto denied that a change in monetary policy is being considered.
But Chiharu Sumita, an economist at UBS Phillips & Drew International, said markets can't lower their guard against a possible increase in Japan's discount rate unless concern about inflation disappears. 

Analysts said fear of higher interest rates prompted investors to sell large-capitalization issues, which are driven by excess liquidity in the market, in favor of smaller companies.
As a result, the index for the second section of the Tokyo stock market, dominated by small companies, rose 1.42%. "People are starting to prefer smaller stocks -- the smaller the better," Mr. Keller said. 

Some selling was also attributed to investors taking profits before retreating to the sidelines in response to the European interest-rate increases.
Takeshi Murakami, deputy branch manager at Schroder Securities (Japan), said investors were waiting to see how stock markets in other countries react to the rate increases. 

Nippon Steel fell 9 yen to 717 yen ($5.04) a share, Sumitomo Metal lost 7 to 695, and Kawasaki Steel was down 17 at 765.
Kawasaki Heavy Industry lost 24 to 975, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industry dropped 30 to 1,050. 

Construction issues were lower across the board.
Maeda lost 20 to 1,880, Kumagai Gumi fell 50 to 1,440, and Kajima was down 40 at 2,020. 

Other losers among rate-sensitive issues included banks.
Mitsubishi Bank fell 40 to 3,150 and Mitsui Bank was down 20 to 2,510. 

Real estate, railway, paper and pulp, and petroleum issues also fell. 

On the other hand, Fuji Photo Film surged 400 to a record price of 5,280.
Seven-Eleven was up 200 to 9,400, Pioneer Electronic gained 130 to 6,160, Yamatake Honeywell advanced 200 to 3,690 and Sumitomo Bank rose 30 to 3,390. 

London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended down 4.1 points at 2277.5, but it had been down more than 30 at its intraday low.
The narrower Financial Times 30-share index was down 8.4 at 1857.8.
Volume was a fairly heavy 505.5 million shares, compared with 491.4 million Thursday. 

The market opened weak in continued reaction to Thursday's rise in U.K. base lending rates to 15% from 14%.
But a surge of buying interest in Jaguar and Saatchi & Saatchi materialized to push prices up. 

"The market just didn't want to fall," one trader said, adding that there seems to be support for shares around the 2250 level on the FT-SE 100. 

"The market's rise was very encouraging," another dealer said. "There was a lot of bargain-hunting at lower levels, and people are still on the outlook for the next bid." 

Some players said the rise in interest rates, though undesirable, will help to damp U.K. inflationary pressures. "If {Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel} Lawson is going to use the high interest rate medicine, he might as well make the tonic strong," one dealer said. 

Jaguar again stole the market's attention, roaring ahead 62 pence to 731 pence ($11.79) a share on volume of 13 million shares.
Ford U.K. Motor, a subsidiary of U.S. car maker Ford Motor, said it received U.S. regulatory clearance to begin buying as much as 15% of Jaguar. "There's all kinds of stories centering on Jaguar," one dealer said, "including the possibility that it might turn to a European suitor as an alternative to both General Motors and Ford." 

Takeover rumors also surrounded Saatchi & Saatchi, with talk that a Swiss concern will offer 375 pence a share for the advertising group.
Saatchi rose 40 to 340 on volume of 10 million shares. 

Guinness climbed 25 to 597 on followthrough buying after a strong interim earnings report Thursday and on the growing perception that its 24% beneficial interest in French luxury goods maker Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey will prove a good investment. 

Tobacco stocks rallied strongly as dealers considered the defensive qualities of the stocks, with Rothmans International closing 18 higher at 643. 

B.A.T rose 14 1/2 to 850 1/2 after an announcement from Hoylake Investments that it intends to make a new offer for B.A.T once it has received clearance from U.S. insurance regulators. 

Among other big gainers, brewer Scottish & Newcastle rose 14 to 375 on rumors of stake-building by an unidentified investor. 

In other European markets, shares closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich and Stockholm, lower in Milan and mixed in Amsterdam and Brussels.
South African gold stocks closed lower. 

Elsewhere, prices rose in Hong Kong, Singapore, Manila, Taipei and Wellington, lower in Seoul and little changed in Sydney. 

Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.
