Lindsay Manufacturing Co. said it expects to report earnings for the fiscal year ended Aug. 31 in the range of $7.2 million to $7.5 million, or $3.50 to $3.60 a share. 

In fiscal 1988, the maker of irrigation systems earned $3.8 million, or $1.82 a share. 

Lindsay also estimated revenue for fiscal 1989 rose 22% to $92.6 million from $76.1 million a year earlier. 

The company cited continued strong international and significantly increased domestic sales of irrigation equipment, higher revenue from diversified manufacturing services and a more efficient manufacturing facility for the record earnings. 

Lindsay added that an order backlog of $22.7 million at Aug. 31, almost even with the backlog of $23.3 million a year earlier, indicates that the company should also experience a strong first quarter.
