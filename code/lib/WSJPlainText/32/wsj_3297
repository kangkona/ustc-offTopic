The U.S. attorney's office in Boston said the government has filed a five-count civil complaint against Data Translation Inc. alleging the company submitted false information to the General Services Administration in order to procure a government contract. 

Data Translation, a Marlborough, Mass. maker of computer products, announced in August that the government had informed it that it was considering such a suit. 

The complaint alleges that in 1983, Data Translation and the GSA entered into negotiations for a contract involving the sale of automatic data processing equipment and software to federal agencies.
It also claims Data Translation provided false and incomplete information about its sales and discount practices in 1983, when the contract was negotiated, and in 1984, when it was renewed. 

The government said Data Translation is liable for treble damages of $1,318,242, and penalties of as much as $10,000 for each false claim submitted to the government. 

Data Translation said its actions "were proper at all times." It also said it has "meritorious defenses" and the "resulting liabilty, if any, won't have a material effect on the company's financial position or results of operations."
