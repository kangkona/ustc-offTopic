Margaux Inc. emerged from Chapter 11 following approval of its reorganization plan by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 

The plan calls for full repayment of secured and unsecured debt during a four-year period, with an option for secured creditors to convert to common stock.
Assuming all secured creditors converted, the company said it would issue about 6.4 million common shares. 

Margaux, a Newark, Calif., maker of supermarket-refrigeration systems, filed for Chapter 11 in March, citing pressure from its main lender.
The company said the lender, Citizens & Southern National Bank, a unit of Citizens & Southern Corp. was pushing a plan to liquidate it. 

Under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, a company operates under protection from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its debts.
