Super Club N.V. will announce today a definitive agreement to acquire Turtle's Inc., a Marietta, Ga., chain of audio and video stores, a spokeswoman for the Belgian video concern said.
Terms weren't disclosed. 

Turtle's, currently owned by Clinton Holdings Inc. and affiliates, operates 114 stores in Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Florida. 

The accord comes a week after Super Club announced a definitive agreement to buy Record Bar Inc., of Durham, N.C., for more than $50 million.
Record Bar has 167 stores in the Southeast and middle Atlantic states. 

The two acquisitions would give Super Club about 330 "home entertainment" stores in the U.S.
The company also rents video films through about 30 vending machines in the U.S., and operates about 160 video stores in Europe, mostly in Belgium, the Netherlands and West Germany. 

Turtle's was founded 12 years ago by Alan Levenson, who agreed to remain president of the chain after Super Club takes control.
The Turtle's stores offer compact disks, tapes and records as well as sales and rental of video films.
The chain plans to open six stores within the next six months.
