Sandy Mac Food Co., a New Jersey meat-processing company, agreed to pay a record $1 million fine after pleading guilty to bribing federal meat inspectors and selling canned hams with excessive amounts of water, the Agriculture Department said. 

Three corporate officials also pleaded guilty to fraud and bribery charges in U.S. District Court in Camden, N.J., and agreed to pay fines totaling $1 million, according to the department.
The $1 million fine against Sandy Mac is the largest in the agency's history. 

Under a plea-bargain agreement, they have sold their stake in the Pennsauken, N.J., company, which markets ham products throughout the U.S. 

Sandy Mac's president, Merton Zitin of Bala Cynwyd, Pa., agreed to a $500,000 fine and faces a maximum sentence of eight years in jail, the department said.
Michael Zitin of Narberth, Pa., vice president, and Robert Zitin of Philadelphia, treasurer, agreed to $250,000 fines each.
Both face up to three years in jail at sentencing.
The three are expected to be sentenced by federal Judge John F. Gerry on Dec. 8. 

Gregory T. Magarity, attorney for Sandy Mac at the Philadelphia law firm Wolf Block Schorr & Solis-Cohen, said it is important "to recognize, as the government did, that there was no health hazard created" by the company's actions. 

A federal grand jury has indicted five meat inspectors and a inspection supervisor in connection with the Sandy Mac case.
They are expected to arraigned on bribery and other charges Oct. 16. 

"This action sends a signal that the USDA and Justice Department will cooperate fully in bringing to justice those who would cheat or harm food consumers," said Lester Crawford, administrator of the department's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
