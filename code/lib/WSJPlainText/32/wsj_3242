Michael Blair resigned as president and chief executive officer of Enfield Corp., where he has been involved in a quarrel with Hees International Bancorp.
Inc., which controls Enfield's largest shareholder. 

Enfield's board last month named a three-man committee to oversee the management of the company.
Mr. Blair said "rather than stay on in title . . . I thought it was appropriate that I accept my dismissal." He said he will try to regain his positions at a special meeting of Enfield shareholders to be held Oct. 31. 

Willard L'Heureux, president of Hees, was named interim president of Enfield and James Meekison, a Toronto businessman, has been appointed to the board and named chairman until the Oct. 31 meeting.
The post of chairman has been vacant for some time; no one has been named to succeed Mr. Blair as chief executive of Enfield. 

The Ontario Supreme Court recently upheld the election of Hees Chairman Timothy Price to Enfield's board, even though Mr. Blair had disallowed ballots favoring Mr. Price at the company's annual meeting. 

Hees, a holding company controlled by Toronto financiers Peter and Edward Bronfman, controls Canadian Express Ltd., which owns about 39% of Enfield. 

Mr. Blair is the founder and second-largest shareholder of Enfield, a Toronto holding company, with an 18% stake.
