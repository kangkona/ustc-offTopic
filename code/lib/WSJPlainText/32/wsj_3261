Vitro S.A. said its THR Corp. unit extended the expiration date to October 13 on its $20-a-share tender offer for all Anchor Glass Container Corp. shares outstanding. 

The offer by the Monterrey, Mexico-based conglomerate had been scheduled to expire Oct 5. 

The company said it has been advised that 8.9 million shares have been tendered, which along with the 1.4 million it owns, total about 75% of the shares outstanding. 

The company also said it signed a confidentiality agreement with Anchor Glass in order to gain access to confidential information it has provided to third parties. 

A spokesman for Anchor Glass said the confidential data provided to Vitro "will demonstrate the soundness and quality of the company" and "ensure the best possible offer from all interested parties."
