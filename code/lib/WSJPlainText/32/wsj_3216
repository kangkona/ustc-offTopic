Rykoff-Sexton Inc. said it amended its shareholder rights plan, but stressed that the move wasn't a defensive one. 

The amendment cuts to 25% from 50% the percentage of the company's common shares that a potential suitor could accumulate before the rights would become exercisable.
Rights holders would then be able to buy the company's stock at half the then current market price. 

Rykoff-Sexton, a Los Angeles-based food service specialist for restaurants and institutions, said in a statement that the amendment wasn't in response to an overture from a possible acquirer. 

The company added that its board also wasn't aware of any such effort. "We just wanted to update the plan to make it more consistent" with those of other companies, a spokesman said.
