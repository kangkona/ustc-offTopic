CAE Industries Ltd., which claims it was overcharged when it bought Singer Co. 's simulation and training business last year for $560 million, reshuffled its balance sheet by 85 million Canadian dollars ($US72.3 million) to reflect the value it now puts on the assets. 

Toronto based-CAE also said it has written down earnings for its second quarter, which ended Sept. 30, by C$10.5 million ($US8.9 million) to reflect cost overruns in two production programs that were part of the purchase. 

As previously reported, CAE brought an action against Singer earlier this year in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, claiming the net worth of the simulation and training business was overstated by US$65 million.
Singer, a Stamford, Conn., defense electronics concern, denied the accusation. 

CAE, which makes electronic and aviation equipment, reported net income of C$42.7 million on revenue of C$838.8 million for the fiscal year ended March 31.
