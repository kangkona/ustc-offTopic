Properties of America Inc. said it filed Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Code petitions for itself and 12 subsidiaries with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court at Worcester, Mass. 

The company, which assists in the planning of the purchase of large land tracts, reported $6.5 million in losses in its year ended June 30.
The Williamstown, Mass.-based company blamed its losses on several factors, including the economic climate and unanticipated delays in gaining regulatory approval for contracts. 

Several companies and individuals have expressed interest in purchasing the principal assets of the company, it said. 

Properties of America and its units have a stake in about 87 different East Coast developments, valued at more than $10 million.
