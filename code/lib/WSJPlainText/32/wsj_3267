Pantera's Corp., Dallas, said it got approval from U.S. Bankruptcy Court to continue operating its restaurants, using its revenues and proceeding with efforts to reorganize. 

According to Pantera's, lenders had cash collateral liens on the company.
Those liens would have impeded its attempts to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code if the court hadn't approved the pizza company's request to use its revenues in operations.
Pantera's filed for protection from creditors in late September, when secured lenders terminated a waiver and called in debts of $35.5 million. 

The company said it closed or is trying to sell 40 of its 180 pizza restaurants, which operate under the Pizza Inn trademark.
Pantera's also said it's trying to revise marketing efforts as a result of the poor performance of its Italian buffet concept. 

Pantera's also will be late filing its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission for its June 30 year.
