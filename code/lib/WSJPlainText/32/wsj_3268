GTE Corp., Stamford, Conn., said its GTE Mobile Communications Group joined a consortium to compete for the license to construct and operate a private, digital, mobile-telecommunications system in Germany. 

The proposed system, called "D2," will span Germany and have the potential to serve more than 60 million people, GTE said. 

Other members of the consortium, operating under the name Deutsche Mobilfunk G.m.b.
H., are: Harperner AG, a Dortmund, Germany, conglomerate active in over-land shipping, real estate and energy; WAZ Group, an Essen, Germany, newspaper publisher; the Berliner Bank; and STC Ltd., a U.K. telecommunications concern. 

GTE said 10 groups are competing for the license, which Bonn has said it will issue in December.
