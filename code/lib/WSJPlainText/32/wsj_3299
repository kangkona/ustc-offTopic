Capital Cities/ABC Inc. 's Kansas City Star Co. announced it will combine its afternoon paper, the Kansas City Star, with its morning Kansas City Times. 

The move -- for which no date has been set -- represents another indication of the growing ascendancy of morning papers, as the readership of afternoon papers is eroded by television and other news sources.
Just this week, the Raleigh (N.C.) Times, published in the afternoon for more than a century, announced that it will cease publication Nov. 

Kansas City Star said a month ago that it was mulling a merger of the two papers, in order to put both in "the best possible strategic position for the long term." 

The surviving paper will be known as the Kansas City Star, but it will use the Times' print type and layout.
In a memo to employees, publisher James H. Hale said there won't be any layoffs because of the merger. 

The Star's daily circulation of about 171,000 has been declining steadily in recent years, while the Times' has grown to its current total of about 267,000.
