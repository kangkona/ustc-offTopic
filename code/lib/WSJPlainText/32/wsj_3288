Applied Magnetics Corp. said it expects to report substantially lower fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $460,000, or three cents a share, on sales of $80.8 million. 

In the year-ago quarter ended Sept. 30, the company had net income of $6.7 million, or 41 cents a share, on sales of $87 million. 

"Too many people on the street had estimates that were considerably higher," said Ben J. Newitt, chairman of this maker of magnetic recording heads.
He said the estimates ranged from 10 cents to 20 cents a share. 

Mr. Newitt said the company has experienced sales and earnings declines since the fourth quarter of 1988 because three of its 10 major customers overextended themselves last year, couldn't pay their bills, and reduced their orders.
Now, the three have reduced their excess inventory and are reordering from Applied Magnetics, Mr. Newitt said.
The company's backlog at Sept. 30 was at $108 million, compared with $116 million a year ago. 

He added that he expects a 15% to 20% increase in sales in fiscal 1990, and believes analysts earnings projections for the year of between $17 million and $20 million, or $1 to $1.25 a share, are on target.
For the year-ago period, the company had net of $23.7 million, or $1.54 a share, on sales of $293 million. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Applied Magnetics closed unchanged yesterday at $11.25 a share.
