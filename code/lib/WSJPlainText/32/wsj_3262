The Energy Department said it will begin negotiations with three groups of companies to design two types of nuclear reactors. 

The department wants to build two reactors to replace its aging and crippled tritium reactors at Savannah River, S.C.
The estimated cost of the new reactors is $6.8 billion.
Many lawmkers, however, contend that only one new reactor is needed.
Tritium is a perishable, radioactive gas that enhances the power of nuclear bombs. 

Westinghouse Electric Corp. and Bechtel National Inc., a unit of Bechtel Group Inc., have teamed up to seek a contract from the department to design a heavy-water reactor.
They are competing against a consortium consisting of Ebasco Services Inc., a subsidiary of Enserch Corp.; Combustion Engineering Inc.; Babcock & Wilcox Co., a subsidiary of McDermott Inc.; NUS Corp., a unit of Halliburton Co.; Rockwell International Corp.; Battelle Memorial Institute, and Sulzer Brothers Ltd. 

The current Savannah River reactors are heavy-water reactors, meaning they use deuterium to cool the fuel. 

For the other contract, to design a modular, high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor, the agency will negotiate with a consortium consisting of General Atomics/Combustion Engineering Inc., Stone & Webster Engineering Co. and Burns & Roe Co.
This type of reactor, based on a relatively new technology, would use a helium coolant. 

The contracts will require the companies to prepare a conceptual design for the reactors with options for preliminary and detailed design and engineering inspection services during construction.
