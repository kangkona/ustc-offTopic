San Diego-based Medi-Mail Inc. said it plans a venture with Indiana's Miami Indian tribe to form a company to distribute pharmaceuticals to 500 tribes and several government agencies that deal with Indian health. 

Medi-Mail hopes that the Native American Pharmacy Inc. venture can begin operating Nov. 1.
The company expects to sign final contracts by the middle of this month and to establish offices for the Indiana venture in the Muncie-Peru area, where about a quarter of the approximately 6,000 U.S. Miami tribe members live. 

Because the federal Indian Health Services alone has an estimated annual pharmacy budget of $75 million, Native American could potentially become a big company very quickly. 

Medi-Mail will provide management services to the company, and although Medi-Mail declined to speculate on the possible size of the venture, Deanna L. Smith, corporate secretary, said "the market is enormous." 

Raymond O. White Jr., Miami tribal chairman, called the agreement "the first major step in the tribe's economic development program." The tribe has offices in Peru. 

For the nine months ended April 30, Medi-Mail reported a net loss of $790,094 on sales of $758,454, compared with a net loss of $251,254 on sales of $108,790 a year before.
The company said it expects to break even sometime in the year that began Aug. 1. 

Medi-Mail, formed in 1985 as a pharmaceutical mail-order business, two years later began concentrating on alliances with such organizations such as health maintenance organizations and the Hadassah, a national Jewish women's organization.
In all, the company, which sells both generic and brand-name drugs, claims between three million and five million customers.
