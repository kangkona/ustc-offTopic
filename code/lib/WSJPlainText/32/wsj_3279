British Steel PLC, Europe's largest publicly owned steelmaker, announced it is buying C. Walker & Sons (Holdings) Ltd, a United Kingdom steel stockholder, for #330 million ($528.7 million). 

British Steel said the acquisition -- which is the largest it has made since it was offered to the public by the U.K. government in November -- will help it strengthen its market position and marks a "further step in its strategy to enhance the quality of earnings and service to customers." 

The Walker group, which has bases in 50 locations in Britain and Ireland and about 3,400 employees, is the largest stockholder in the U.K. and British Steel's largest customer. 

Walker recorded profit before tax and extraordinary items of #48.4 million, for the year ended June 3, on sales of #624 million.
British Steel said Walker will help "improve its distribution network for finished products and complement its existing stockholding operations in the U.K., continental Europe and North America." 

The deal is subject to approval from the usual regulatory bodies.
