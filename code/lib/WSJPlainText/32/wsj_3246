Rexene Corp. said it expects to report a loss for the third quarter because of lower polyethylene, polypropylene and styrene prices.
In the 1988 third quarter, the company earned $35.5 million, or $1.21 a share. 

The chemicals concern said it also expects to report sales for the quarter of $141 million, compared with $186 million the year before.
Earlier last week, the company announced it would cut its work force about 10%, eliminating 135 jobs. 

In addition, the company said it has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement for the resale of $500 million in increasing-rate notes sold in private placements in July. 

Rexene sold the notes to raise money to pay a $7-a-share dividend July 27.
The dividend appeared to be an attempt to transfer some of the value of the company to its shareholders, which included several current and former employees and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
The dividend plan resulted in a class-action lawsuit brought by employees who worked at the company in 1984 and 1985. 

Rexene also said it has announced a price increase of three cents a pound for its polyethylene product line, effective Nov. 1. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Rexene closed at $7.50, down 50 cents.
