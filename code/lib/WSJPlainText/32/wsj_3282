President Bush is scheduled to undergo minor surgery today to remove a cyst from a finger on his right hand, the White House said. 

The procedure, which is to be performed at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, should take about an hour, Marlin Fitzwater, White House press secretary, said.
Mr. Bush will receive a local anesthetic and will be awake through the procedure, the spokesman added. 

Mr. Bush has had the cyst for several years, and Mr. Fitzwater said that he is having it removed now because it has become a nuisance.
Doctors consider the cyst benign, but will perform a biopsy on it after it is removed, the White House said.
