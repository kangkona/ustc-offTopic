Western Micro Technology Inc., Saratoga, Calif., said it expects to report a "small loss" for the third quarter.
The company wouldn't be more specific, and wouldn't comment on sales. 

In the year-earlier quarter, the company posted net income of $840,000, or 29 cents a share, on sales of $25.8 million. 

The electronics-distribution concern attributed the loss to costs associated with starting new branches in Texas and New Jersey, lower-than-expected revenue in its test division, and continued pricing pressure in the memory business.
Western Micro said it expects "these issues will be favorably managed during the next two quarters."
