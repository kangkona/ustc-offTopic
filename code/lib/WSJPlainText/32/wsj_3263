Du Pont Co. and Fuji Photo Film Co. said they completed the previously announced acquisition of a printing-equipment business from De La Rue Co. for about $370 million. 

The De La Rue unit, Hemel Hempstead, England-based Crosfield Electronics Ltd., makes digital scanners, page-composition systems and other equipment used by printers to produce high-resolution color images, such as those in glossy magazines. 

The acquisition allows Du Pont, a diversified chemicals company based here, and Fuji, an imaging and information-products company based in Tokyo, to cooperate in markets where they don't traditionally compete.
