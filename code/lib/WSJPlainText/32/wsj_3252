Roy F. Weston Inc. said it expects to report a net loss for the third quarter. 

Roy F. Weston, chairman and chief executive officer of the consulting engineering concern, said operations will be "near break-even" because of a shortfall in the operating results from the consulting and laboratory divisions and delays in the start-up of field thermal treatment units. 

In the 1988 third quarter, the company had net income of $1.6 million, or 20 cents a share, on revenue of $35 million. 

In this year's third quarter, Weston set up several reserves and made certain adjustments, which will amount to about $2.5 million, net of income taxes. 

Weston said one reserve was established for an anticipated settlement resulting from a recent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency investigation of the company's Lionville Analytical Laboratory.
Another reserve was set up to cover restructuring costs for its consulting divisions and administrative staffs, the company said. 

Weston said it also will write off costs related to its equipment services group and systems development areas, and uncollectable revenue related to several projects.
