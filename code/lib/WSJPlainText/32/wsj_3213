Unum Corp. said it expects to pay $41.50 each for 5,089,958 common shares that were tendered at $41.50 or less in a Dutch auction tender offer that expired Oct. 6. 

The insurance holding company, based in Portland, Maine, declined to give the total number of shares tendered.
In a Dutch auction, the buyer sets a price range and holders give a price in the range at which they are willing to sell shares.
The buyer then picks a price and buys shares at that price from holders who offered to sell at that price or lower. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Unum closed at $41.50, down 12.5 cents. 

Unum last month launched a Dutch auction offer to buy five million shares in the range of $37.50 to $43.00 a common share.
To avoid proration, the company exercised its right to increase the number of shares purchased. 

With the completion of the offer, Unum had 35,493,771 shares outstanding.
