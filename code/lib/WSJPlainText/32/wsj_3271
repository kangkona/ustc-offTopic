Federal Industries Ltd. said its consumer group agreed to acquire W.H. Smith Canada Ltd., operator of Canada's largest chain of book stores, for 54 million Canadian dollars ($US45.9 million) from W.H. Smith Group PLC of Britain and various institutional investors. 

The Manitoba-based retailing, metals distribution and transportation concern, said W.H. Smith Canada had sales of C$157.8 million for the year ended June 3, 1989.
No management changes are planned for the company, which has 306 retail outlets and owns a wholesale foreign newspaper and magazine operation. 

Federal Industries said the acquisition, which is conditional on approval of the landlords of W.H. Smith's stores, is a strategic addition to its consumer group, which operates stationary and greeting card operations, among other things.
