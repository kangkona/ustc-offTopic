Aca Joe Inc., which recently emerged from Chapter 11, said it posted a second-quarter loss of about $2.2 million and expects losses for the rest of the year. 

The San Francisco clothing retailer said the loss in the quarter ended July 29 was on revenue of about $2.5 million.
The company blamed sluggish sales and restructuring costs associated with its Chapter 11 reorganization. 

Aca Joe incurred heavy losses from growing too fast on inadequate capital and encountering problems with suppliers.
The chain filed for protection from creditors under the federal Bankruptcy Code in May 1988.
In April, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco approved its plan of reorganization. 

Aca Joe estimates that, as of June 19, it had assets of $8.3 million, and liabilities of $12.3 million.
The company said it expects to meet demand for working capital by drawing on a line of credit made available by United Trend Investment Ltd. as part of the plan of reorganization. 

Hong Kong-based United Trend, which has served as Aca Joe's general manager and owns 65% of the company, has agreed to make $15 million available; as of Oct. 4, Aca Joe said it had borrowed about $12.5 million of that line of credit.
