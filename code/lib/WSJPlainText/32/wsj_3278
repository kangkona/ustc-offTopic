The Treasury Department plans to propose that banks be required to keep information on international wire transfers in an effort to combat money laundering. 

Under the proposal, large banks would be required to keep records of the names and account information of the originator and recipient of funds wired internationally.
Salvatore Martoche, assistant Treasury secretary for enforcement, mentioned the proposal in Senate testimony this week.
Details haven't been worked out. 

Currently, banks are required to submit to the government written reports on any cash deposit larger than $10,000.
But wire transfers -- even those bigger than $10,000 -- from a standing account aren't reported.
Regulators and criminal justice officials believe international drug businesses are trying to disguise their payments by wiring money back and forth between several countries. 

Mr. Martoche also said the Treasury intends to propose that banks report cash transactions on computer tape rather than in written reports, so they can be processed more efficiently. 

John Byrne, an American Bankers Association official, said banks would cooperate with the initiatives.
But he said the plans may run into difficulty abroad because some foreign countries prohibit banks from taking identifying information about wire transfers.
