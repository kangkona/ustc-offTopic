HAL Inc., Honolulu, said a group seeking to acquire the company reached agreements with its unions, allowing the bid to proceed. 

The group, which includes former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth, has offered $22 a share, or about $21.9 million, for 51% of HAL.
The offer was subject to certain conditions, including reaching agreements with the company's unions, by last Friday. 

HAL, the parent company of island-hopping Hawaiian Airlines, said a condition that the group arrange preliminary financing commitments was waived.
The company's directors plan to meet today to review preliminary financing commitments from Security Pacific Merchant Bank.
The financing commitments propose certain amendments to the offer, but the price isn't affected, HAL said.
Officials weren't immediately available to elaborate. 

The offer is scheduled to expire tomorrow, but the group said it plans to extend the offer to three business days after a special meeting of shareholders to consider the proposal.
That meeting is expected to be held in early November.
