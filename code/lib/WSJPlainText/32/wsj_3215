National Bancorp of Alaska, Anchorage, said third-quarter net income jumped to $6.5 million, or $1.09 a share, from the year-earlier $307,000, or five cents a share, partly because of cash pumped into the economy after the massive oil spill. 

The tanker Exxon Valdez ran into a reef in March, spilling 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound.
The thousands of people who came to Alaska following the spill, including scientists, government workers and those involved in cleanup efforts, "definitely had a clear impact" on the bank's quarter by helping the overall economy, a spokeswoman said. 

"Many of our customers are experiencing their first good season in years" because of cash brought in by the spill, increased economic activity and a decrease in overall competition, the bank said.
For the nine months, the bank holding concern posted net income of $16.8 million, or $2.81 a share, up from $5.5 million, or 92 cents a share, a year earlier.
