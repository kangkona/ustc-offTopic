The Senate confirmed Gerard Scannell as assistant secretary of labor for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 

Mr. Scannell, 54 years old, for the past 10 years was director of safety and environmental affairs for Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, N.J., the big health-care products company.
He was an official of OSHA, a Labor Department unit, between 1971 and 1979. 

Though OSHA is a controversial agency, subject to frequent congressional criticism as being lax in worker safety and health protection, the Senate Labor Committee earlier took the unusual action of approving Mr. Scannell's nomination without holding a confirmation hearing.
He has been outspoken about his plans to vigorously expand OSHA's programs, and his selection engendered little opposition from business or labor groups.
