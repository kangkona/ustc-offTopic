USX Corp. said it filed a lawsuit against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., charging that a Drexel client defaulted on $23.9 million of commercial paper Drexel sold to USX earlier last year. 

The suit, filed in U.S. District Court here, alleges that USX wasn't advised by Drexel of the client's financial condition and that Drexel knew there was a risk of default by the firm.
Drexel sold Integrated Resources Inc. 's commercial paper to USX in May, and Integrated stopped making the payments on or around June 9, USX said. 

A spokesman for Drexel said the Wall Street brokerage firm believes it fulfilled its obligations on Integrated's paper. "We have not seen the complaint yet," a spokesman at Drexel said. "But we believe we have fulfilled our obligations to purchasers of Integrated commercial paper." 

Integrated Resources, a New York-based financial services and insurance firm, recently signed an agreement to sell most of its businesses to Whitehall Financial Group, a partnership of a branch of Canada's Bronfman family and Mandy Moross, a London investor, for $310 million. 

The firm has been racing to complete the transaction by its Oct. 15 deadline to avoid a bankruptcy filing, after having failed to make interest payments in June on nearly $1 billion of debt.
The company owes about $1.8 billion to creditors. 

USX, a steel, oil and chemical concern, declined to comment on the suit.
