Bond prices ended unchanged to modestly lower as investors kept a close watch on the dollar. 

The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell less than 1/8 point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount, while the yield moved to 8.25% from 8.24%.
Corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities were essentially unchanged, but municipal bonds ended as much as 1/4 point higher, aided by strong demand for new issues. 

In the Treasury market, traders said bonds were narrowly mixed for most of the day, rising and falling by modest amounts in sympathy with the U.S. currency.
Although international efforts to force the dollar down continued, the currency was resilient in New York and was slightly higher in overnight trading in Tokyo. 

Responding to the dollar's buoyancy, Japanese, British and French government bonds ended lower, while West German government bonds were mixed. 

At midday, U.S. Treasurys were as much as 1/4 point lower.
Later, however, they recovered slightly on the belief that the Resolution Funding Corp. might not hold its initial bond offering as soon as expected.
For weeks, bond investors have worried about the impact of the agency's bonds on a market that is struggling to digest $20 billion of Treasury and agency securities auctioned this week. 

Resolution Funding is a new government agency created to raise money to rescue the U.S.'s ailing savings and loan associations. 

In the mortgage market, traders said New York-based Seaman's Bank for Savings sold as much as $1 billion of derivative securities, sparking interest in an otherwise quiet market. 

Although officials at Seaman's wouldn't comment, traders said the thrift sold an unusual package of mortgage products that included interest-only classes, inverse floating-rate securities and real estate mortgage investment conduit, or Remic, residuals. 

Some of these securities, such as the inverse floating-rate issues, have rarely been seen since they were issued in a brief period in 1987 when mortgage rates were at a low for the decade. 

As the name implies, inverse floating-rate securities' yields rise when interest rates fall and drop when rates rise.
A few Wall Street underwriters ran up large losses in April 1987 when they mispriced hundreds of millions of dollars of inverse floating-rate issues and saw prices drop as interest rates soared. 

Traders said the interest-only securities were backed by high-coupon issues such as Government National Mortgage Association 11 1/2% securities.
These interest-only securities, which appreciate when rates rise, also were issued primarily in 1987. 

The Department of Commerce is due to release the U.S. index of leading economic indicators for August today.
Fourteen economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report expect, on average, a 0.3% increase in the index.
The leading indicators rose 0.2% in July and were unchanged in June after a 1.3% drop in May. 

Treasury Securities 

Treasury bonds ended slightly lower in light trading. 

The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 98 15/32 compared with 98 18/32 Wednesday.
The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 97 26/32 to yield 8.31% compared with 97 30/32 to yield 8.29%. 

Short-term rates moved higher.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was quoted at 7.89% for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.14%, while the discount rate on six-month Treasury bills was 7.84% for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.26%. 

Bonds had been down as much as 1/4 point at midday, but they recovered slightly later in the day on perceptions that Resolution Funding Corp. might not hold its initial bond offering as soon as expected.
For weeks, bond market analysts have maintained that Refcorp, a new agency created to raise money to rescue the ailing savings and loan associaitons, was ready to announce details of its first bond auction. 

Foreign Bonds 

Most foreign bonds ended lower as the dollar held its ground against continued central bank intervention. 

The dollar ended a little higher in New York and was resilient in overnight trading in Tokyo and Europe. 

In Japan, the dollar had been expected to decline.
When it didn't, yen-denominated government bonds retreated.
The dollar ended in Tokyo at 140.85 yen, up from 140.7 at the opening and above late Wednesday's 140.15 yen in New York. 

Japan's benchmark No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 fell 0.09 point to end on brokers' screens at 96.33.
The issue's yield rose 0.15 percentage point to 5.210%. 

Most of the 500 billion yen ($3.57 billion) of 4.9% government bonds -- 200 billion yen of which were put on the block, with the balance placed through an underwriting syndicate -- were expected to sit with dealers. 

"The market is very, very volatile," said one dealer. "Investors can't make up their minds" about what and when to buy. 

The dollar also ended higher in Europe.
It was quoted at 1.8810 marks, compared with 1.8794 marks late Wednesday in New York.
Sterling ended the European trading day at $1.6085, down from $1.6173 in New York late Wednesday. 

Meanwhile, Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 fell 7/32 to 111 15/32 to yield 10.15%, while the 11 3/4% notes due 1991 fell 2/32 to 98 19/32 to yield 12.89%. 

Besides the gyrations of the currency markets, British investors were focusing on today's scheduled "reverse auction," in which the Bank of England will buy as much as #400 million ($646.9 million) of issues outstanding in the seven-year to 15-year range on a competitive basis. 

In West Germany, government bond prices ended narrowly mixed.
The Treasury's 6 3/4% issue due June 1999 rose 0.05 point to close at 98.25 to yield 7%, while the 6 3/4% notes due 1994 rose 0.025 point to 98.175 to yield 7.22%. 

Corporate Issues 

Corporate bonds closed unchanged in quiet, directionless trading. 

Metropolis of Tokyo offered investors a $175 million issue of guaranteed bonds in its first appearance in the Yankee market this year. "Yankee" bonds are issued in the U.S. by foreign companies. 

The 10-year issue, which is guaranteed by Japan, was priced at 99.9 to yield 8.715% through an underwriting syndicate led by Goldman, Sachs & Co. 

Metropolis of Tokyo is a periodic borrower in the Yankee market, and its issues generally meet with strong investor demand.
Yesterday's issue was sold out before pricing, according to syndicate officials. 

In other new-issue activity, BankAmerica Corp. tapped the market yesterday with a $150 million issue of three-year floating-rate notes.
The notes were priced with an interest rate that will float even with the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate, and they were being offered to investors at various prices. 

The size of the issue was increased from an originally planned $100 million. 

Municipals 

A successful reception for the week's more than $2.4 billion of new municipal debt and a lighter supply overhang helped municipals climb 1/8 to 1/4 in late dealings. 

The modest price advances posted by many seasoned dollar bond issues put them ahead of long Treasurys, which were little changed on the day. 

In the secondary market, New Jersey Turnpike Authority 7.20% issue of 2018 was locked at 96 3/4, up 1/4 from late Wednesday's 96 1/2 to 96 5/8.
The issue yielded about 7.48%, or .01 percentage point less than late Wednesday. 

Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority 7 1/8% issue of 2019 was at 95 5/8 to 95 3/4, up 1/4 for the session. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities 

Mortgage securities ended narrowly mixed after moderate dealings. 

Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities ended at 96 5/8, down 2/32, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9% securities gained 1/32 to 96.
