Arco Chemical Co. agreed to purchase two chemicals businesses from Union Carbide Corp. for $220 million. 

Arco Chemical will acquire plants and other assets involved in production of propylene glycols -- which are used in making personal care products such as shampoo -- and urethane polyols, used in making polyurethane foam found in furniture cushioning and other products.
The transaction is subject to governmental reviews. 

Arco Chemical is 83%-owned by Atlantic Richfield Co., a Los Angeles-based oil company. 

Carbide, a chemical company based in Danbury, Conn., said it will record a third-quarter gain on the sale of $62 million.
But it said the gain will be largely offset by a charge of $55 million in the same quarter from a write-down in its polysilicon business. 

Carbide said the write-down recognizes the true value of the business "in the current competitive environment." Polysilicon is a raw material used in making integrated circuits.
