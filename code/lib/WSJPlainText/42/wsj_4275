Artra Group Inc. said it has received an offer to buy a unit of Sage Group, a closely-held company that is majority owned by Artra's top two officers. 

The company said the proposal calls for Artra to issue 772,000 of its common shares for Bagcraft Corp. of America, a Chicago-based maker of flexible packaging products with annual sales of more than $110 million.
In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Artra shares closed at $18.875, up 12.5 cents, giving the transaction an indicated value of $14.6 million. 

Artra has interests in fashion jewelry and assessories and food-industry supplies.
It said its chairman, John J. Harvey, and its president, Peter R. Harvey, who are brothers, also own 13% of Artra's 3.1 million common shares outstanding.
The transaction, which is expected to close by Dec. 31, is subject to approval by Artra shareholders.
