Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it raised the ratings on about $3 billion of senior long-term debt and commercial paper of Enron Corp. 

The ratings concern said the changes recognize expected improvement in Enron's capital structure and operating position, resulting from planned financings, as well as a better outlook for its business segments. 

Among the natural gas transmission concern's securities upgraded by Moody's are its senior subordinated notes, to Baa-3 from Ba-2; its U.S. commercial paper and Eurocommercial paper, to Prime-2 from Prime-3; and InterNorth Inc. Eurobonds, notes and debentures, to Baa-2 from Baa-3.
Enron was formerly InterNorth Inc. 

Additionally, the pending sale of a 12% interest in Enron Oil & Gas, which Moody's expects to generate proceeds of at least $130 million, will enable Enron to continue its ongoing debt-reduction program and reduce its interest burden, Moody's said.
