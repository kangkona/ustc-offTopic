The Bush administration is beginning to consider new steps to aid Poland, including naming a special coordinator for Polish assistance and sending over teams of economic experts, a senior official said. 

Consideration of additional steps to aid Poland has been prompted by two developments, the official said.
Administration aides are pleased with meetings they held this week with Poland's new, non-Communist foreign and finance ministers, who presented their plans for economic change.
President Bush has insisted that additional U.S. aid should come only after changes in Poland's socialist economic system are under way. 

Secondly, the administration has concluded that Congress is determined to vote more aid for Poland than the $100 million in food assistance President Bush has requested, so officials want to lay plans to spend additional aid wisely. 

The new special coordinator for Poland would be a presidential "point man" charged with ensuring that steps taken within the U.S. government to help Poland are being coordinated.
The experts sent to Poland would, among other things, advise the Poles on how to formulate new economic plans that would meet the approval of the International Monetary Fund.
