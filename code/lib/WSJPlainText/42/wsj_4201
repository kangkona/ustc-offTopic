Foxboro Co., citing "unabsorbed" overhead expenses and costs associated with delayed shipments of its Intelligent Automation series, said "gross margins will not fulfill our expectations for the balance of 1989." 

The maker of industrial-automation products said earnings for the third quarter, which ends tomorrow,will be higher than last year because of a one-time gain from the sale of a facility. 

Last year, the company had net income of $2.7 million, or 22 cents a share, on sales of $127.6 million. 

The company said earnings for 1989 will be ahead of last year when it had net of $9.8 million, or 80 cents a share, on sales of $539.9 million. 

The concern declined to make specific earnings projections for the third quarter or year. 

Jay D. Hobson, manager of corporate services and investments, predicted gross margins of as low as 35% for the year while analysts have predicted gross margins of 39% or higher.
Mr. Hobson also said analysts have predicted earnings of $1.30 to $1.60 a share for the year. 

To improve results, the company said is offering a smaller version of the I/A system, with potentially higher margins, for smaller users.
In addition, the company said its sales and service personnel will target new markets for the system. 

Debugging the software for the two-year old I/A series was "far more complex than . . . with our earlier lines," but "is now in place and functioning." 

The company also said it is instituting a cost-containment program to reduce redundancies and manufacturing space.
No layoffs are planned. 

Mr. Hobson said Foxboro currently has "the highest backlog in its history, but not all for the right reasons."
