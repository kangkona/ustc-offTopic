Lomas Financial Corp. 's commercial leasing unit said it has fallen behind on payments of some notes and is attempting to restructure $633.9 million of its debt. 

The unit, Equitable Lomas Leasing Corp., San Diego, has remained out of bankruptcy court despite its parent's decision to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from creditors last week. 

Equitable said it has failed to pay about $8 million in privately placed notes as they fell due during the past month, but added that the creditors haven't declared them in default.
It said those notes would be included in a restructuring of about half of its $1.18 billion of total debt. 

Equitable said it expects to reach an agreement in principle shortly with creditors that would permit it to forgo payments of principal, but not of interest, on the $633.9 million in debt through Nov. 30 while it negotiates a longer-term restructuring.
It added that it is currently paying interest on all its debt and principal payments on its publicly held medium-term notes as they fall due. 

Lomas, a financial services and real estate concern that filed for Chapter 11 after failing to reach a restructuring accord with its creditors, is seeking a buyer for Equitable Lomas.
