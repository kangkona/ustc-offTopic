Summcorp said its directors adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to block a hostile takeover. 

The bank holding company said it isn't aware of any takeover threat. 

Under the plan, shareholders of record date Oct. 13 will receive one right for each share held.
Under certain conditions, each right would entitle its holder to buy shares of an acquiring company.
The rights expire Oct. 15, 1999. 

In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Summcorp closed at $22.25, unchanged.
