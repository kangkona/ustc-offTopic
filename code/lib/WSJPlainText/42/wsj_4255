Anti-nuclear activists sued the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the president to stop the Oct. 12 launch of the Galileo probe to Jupiter, citing safety risks. 

The three groups, the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice, the Christic Institute and the Foundation on Economic Trends, alleged in U.S. court here that NASA had underestimated the risks of the launch.
They said NASA hadn't planned how to evacuate people around Kennedy Space Center in case the shuttle Atlantis exploded.
Atlantis will boost Galileo, which carries 50 pounds of radioactive plutonium for power. 

Galileo "will condemn thousands of persons residing in eastern Florida to a wholly unnecessary and virtual certainty of contracting cancer in the event of a shuttle accident resulting in the release of plutonium," the groups said. 

NASA and the White House have long contended Galileo is safe.
In nearly all potential accidents, according to NASA's impact statement, the plutonium release would be so small it wouldn't cause any cancer deaths. 

A separate interagency panel also rated the safety of Galileo, and came up with some substantially different risk assessments than NASA.
To pick up enough speed to reach Jupiter, for instance, Galileo must fly twice past Earth.
If the craft crashes into Earth, NASA estimated that only nine cancer deaths could result.
The interagency panel, however, said the cancer death count could total, at worst, 2,000.
