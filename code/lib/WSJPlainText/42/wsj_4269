Interlake Corp. on Sept. 27 paid a previously announced $45-a-share special dividend to shareholders of record Aug. 21. 

The company, which makes engineered materials and handling and packaging systems, declared the special $455 million pay-out in August, as part of a restructuring designed to thwart potential suitor Mark IV Industries Inc. 

Mark IV of Pittsburgh disclosed in July that it was seeking regulators' permission to buy an Interlake stake of up to 14.9%. 

Under Interlake's restructuring plan, which is generally thought to have deflected any possible Mark IV interest, the company also borrowed $550 million to pay for the dividend and to refinance previous debt holdings.
Interlake shares will begin trading on an ex-dividend basis today.
