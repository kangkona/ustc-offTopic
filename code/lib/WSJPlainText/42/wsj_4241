Damages caused by Hurricane Hugo in the southeastern U.S. and in the Caribbean will cost insurers an estimated $3.98 billion, according to the property-claims-service division of the American Insurance Service Group. 

Approximately $500 million more in flood losses will be covered by the National Flood Insurance Program and "Write Your Own" insurance programs. 

The industry trade group said the worst damage, an estimated $2.55 billion, occurred in South Carolina, where the coastal counties of Charleston, Horry, Georgetown and Berkeley were battered by the storm a week ago.
Losses in North Carolina were estimated at $275 million, while insured losses in Georgia and Virginia were estimated at $1 million and $5 million respectively.
More than 360,000 hurricane-related claims are expected. 

In Puerto Rico, insured property losses were estimated at $700 million, and Virgin Islands losses were estimated at $450 million.
