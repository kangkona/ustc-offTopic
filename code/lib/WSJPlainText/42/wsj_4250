Canadian regulators approved the 606 million Canadian dollar (US$513.6 million) purchase by Maclean Hunter Ltd. of Selkirk Communications Ltd., a Toronto-based television and radio broadcaster. 

However, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission rejected part of a plan by Maclean Hunter to sell some Selkirk TV and radio operations.
Maclean Hunter is a Toronto-based publishing and broadcasting company. 

The commission rejected Maclean Hunter's proposal to sell two Edmonton, Alberta, radio stations to Westcom Radio Group Ltd., a subsidiary of WIC Western International Communications Ltd., Vancouver.
The commission said it wasn't satisfied with Westcom's plans for operating the stations. 

The regulators also rejected Maclean Hunter's proposal to sell a Hamilton, Ontario, television station to Blackburn Group Inc., a closely held publishing and broadcasting company based in London, Ontario, saying they weren't satisfied with the prospective buyer's plans for strengthening the station's operations. 

The panel approved Maclean Hunter's plans to sell Selkirk's television operations in Alberta and British Columbia to Western International Communications and to sell Selkirk's radio operations in the same two provinces to Toronto-based Rogers Communications Inc. 

The federal agency ordered Maclean Hunter to invest C$21.2 million in a fund to be used to strengthen the Canadian broadcasting system.
It said the sum represented the difference between the estimated C$627.2 million value of Selkirk's assets and the C$606 million that Maclean Hunter paid for them.
The agency opposes capital gains by companies on the purchase and sale of broadcasting assets.
