Sogo Co., a Japanese department-store chain, is considering bidding for the Saks Fifth Avenue retail chain expected to be sold by B.A.T Industries PLC, according to executives familiar with the situation. 

For the year ended Feb. 28, Sogo, of Osaka, had net income of 3.14 billion yen ($22.4 million) on revenue of 262 billion yen ($1.87 billion). 

Sogo officials couldn't be reached for comment.
According to sources, Sogo is negotiating to hire an investment banking firm to advise it on a Saks bid. 

Pending shareholder approval, B.A.T, a London tobacco conglomerate, plans to sell all its U.S. retailing operations, including Saks and Marshall Field.
The managements at both chains have indicated they intend to propose leveraged buy-outs.
