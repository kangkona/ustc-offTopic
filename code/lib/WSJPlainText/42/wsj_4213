The suspension of trading in shares of Cie. de Navigation Mixte and its three listed insurance subsidiaries has sparked rumors of an impending defensive alliance with other European insurance or banking groups. 

Paris's Cie.
Financiere de Paribas and Assurances Generales de France and Munich's Allianz AG all are being mentioned as likely partners for the French holding company.
The most persistent rumor is that one or more of them would invest in Navigation Mixte or in its insurance units, possibly accompanied by a Navigation Mixte reorganization. 

All concerned parties declined to comment.
Navigation Mixte has scheduled an announcement for Monday.
Its shares were suspended Wednesday at its request, pending that announcement. 

Navigation Mixte, whose shares are broadly held, has been the target of heavy trading and takeover rumors off and on for years.
Trading has been heavy again since August.
It has long been expected to announce some form of anti-takeover move. 

Most recently, state-owned Assurances Generales de France announced in a regulatory filing that it built up a stake of more than 5% in Navigation Mixte.
Brokers said it was uncertain whether the state group was friend or foe. 

The trading suspension affected Navigation Mixte, as well as its units Via Assurances Iard on the cash market, Via S.A. on the unlisted market and Rhin et Moselle Vie on the Nancy unlisted market. 

The suspension didn't affect Navigation Mixte's listed non-insurance units.
Navigation Mixte holds majority holdings in such varied concerns as Via Banque, Cie.
Francaise de Sucrerie, Cie.
Generale de Transport et d'Industrie, and Saupiquet S.A., a canned-food concern.
It also holds stakes in a wide variety of other businesses, including a large baking concern. 

In 1988, Navigation Mixte had net income of 989 million francs ($155.3 million) on revenue of 18.13 billion francs.
