Gillette Co. reached an agreement with California's attorney general and three environmental groups to remove a potentially cancer-causing chemical from its widely used Liquid Paper typing correction products and to pay $300,000 in fines and legal costs. 

The formal settlement, signed yesterday, calls for Gillette to eliminate trichloroethylene, a chemical used to make Liquid Paper dry faster. 

The agreement was concluded under California's Proposition 65, a 1986 voter initiative that includes broad labeling requirements for products containing any of about 400 suspected carcinogenic chemicals.
According to the parties, it is the first case in which a manufacturer has agreed to eliminate potential carcinogens from a product after a public complaint filed under the law. 

A lawyer acting for Gillette said the company quickly agreed to make the change "to eliminate any confusion or concern about the product." The lawyer, Michele Corash, added that "Gillette believes that Liquid Paper is safe." 

While the settlement requires changing the formulation of Liquid Paper for the California market only, it's likely that trichloroethylene will be removed from the product in all markets, Ms. Corash said.
