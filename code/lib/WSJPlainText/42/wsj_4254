Stock speculator Ivan Boesky secretly tape-recorded three conversations with indicted junk-bond financier Michael Milken in 1986 shortly before Mr. Boesky was publicly named as a government informant, court documents indicate. 

The nature of the discussions wasn't disclosed and prosecutors and defense lawyers declined to discuss their content.
But the tapes could emerge as critical evidence in Mr. Milken's scheduled March 1990 trial on fraud and racketeering charges. 

The tape recordings, made on Oct. 1, Oct. 9 and Nov. 6, 1986, were mentioned in a letter from the government to lawyers representing Mr. Milken.
The letter was attached to a recent filing in U.S. District Court in New York. 

The final recorded conversation occurred just eight days before the disclosure that Mr. Boesky made a deal to cooperate with prosecutors in their investigation of Wall Street corruption. 

Milken, the former head of junk-bond operations for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., was indicted in March on 98 counts of fraud and racketeering.
Mr. Boesky in November 1986 agreed to plead guilty to one criminal count of filing false information with the government and is serving a three-year jail term. 

Arthur Liman, an attorney for Mr. Milken, said in a statement: "As we've said in the past, we will not try this case in the press, and we look forward to a full hearing in court."
