William G. Remington, 58 years old, relinquished his posts as chairman and president of Peerless Tube Co., partly "for health reasons," the company said.
It didn't elaborate. 

He was named vice chairman of Peerless, a newly created, less active post at the maker of metal and plastic tubes and aerosol cans. 

He is succeeded as chairman by his brother Frederic Remington Jr., 59, and as president by Richard Potts, 52. 

This year the company's sales have been weak and the costs of aluminum -- the company's primary raw material -- have been high, denting earnings.
The company in May announced that it was cutting the quarterly dividend in half to five cents a share as a result. 

In July, the company reported that six-month sales fell to $26.4 million, from $27.2 million a year earlier.
Net income dropped to $15,910 from $642,916. 

Frederic Remington, who had been senior vice president of engineering, also takes the new post of chief executive officer.
Mr. Potts, formerly senior vice president of production, was also named chief operating officer, another new post. 

The Remingtons and their family control about 32.3% of Peerless, which was formed by their father.
A spokesman said no other upper management changes are expected.
