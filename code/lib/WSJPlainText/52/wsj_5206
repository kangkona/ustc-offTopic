New England Electric System and a nonprofit environmental organization proposed an energy conservation program under which New England Electric would be allowed a return for savings it achieves by improving energy efficiency in customers' buildings. 

Under the plan, submitted to state regulators for approval, the utility would receive about 15% of measured savings from installing high-efficiency electric lighting, heating, cooling and motor-drive equipment into homes, offices and factories.
The utility, which expects to spend $40 million on such measures this year without the return-on-savings incentive, would increase its spending to $65 million in 1990 and more in future years, if the proposal is approved. 

Armond Cohen, a senior attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation, Boston, said the program would be the first in the country that ties the utility's return to the amount of energy saved, rather than to the amount of money invested.
That makes the returns for the utility potentially larger, and provides an incentive to choose effective conservation measures over investments in new plants, he said. 

New England Electric said it expects the $65 million in conservation investments to save customers about $160 million over the life of the investments.
