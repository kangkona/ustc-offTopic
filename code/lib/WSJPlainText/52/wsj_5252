MGM/UA Communications Co. and the U.S. sales unit of Daihatsu Motor Co. have ended their dispute over Daihatsu's use of the name Rocky for one of its vehicles. 

MGM/UA, of Beverly Hills, Calif., said Daihatsu has agreed to pay an undisclosed amount of money and has agreed to refrain from using imagery from the "Rocky" movie series in its marketing of the four-wheel drive sport utility vehicle.
MGM/UA owns the "Rocky" motion pictures, starring Sylvester Stalone.
Neither company would disclose further details of the settlement. 

Japanese auto maker Daihatsu already sells its Rocky sport utility vehicle in more than 100 countries, the company said.
It plans to begin selling Rocky in the U.S. in November.
Earlier this year MGM/UA objected to Daihatsu's use of the name Rocky, but the two companies never took their disagreement to court.
