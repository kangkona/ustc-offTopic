McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., Kirkland, Wash., said it extended its $5.96 billion, $110-a-share bid for LIN Broadcasting Corp. until Oct. 13. 

The offer was to expire today.
As reported, New York-based LIN agreed earlier this month to merge its domestic cellular telephone interests with BellSouth in a move aimed at thwarting McCaw's bid. 

As part of that transaction, Atlanta-based BellSouth will receive newly issued LIN common shares representing a 50% stake after the merger.
In addition, BellSouth might also receive some LIN preferred stock.
LIN also plans to spin off its television broadcasting subsidiaries to stockholders and to pay its pre-merger stockholders a special cash dividend of $20 a share. 

Some analysts had expected McCaw to try to derail BellSouth's bid by raising its own offer, but so far McCaw has held firm.
McCaw said 8.1 million LIN shares have been tendered under its offer; LIN has more than 50 million shares outstanding. 

In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, LIN closed at $106.25 a share, up $1, while McCaw closed at $36 a share, down 25 cents.
