Weyerhaeuser Co. said it agreed to sell its Wight Nurseries Inc. unit to the unit's employee stock ownership plan. 

Terms weren't disclosed.
The big forest products concern said the sale of the Cairo, Ga., unit is part of its previously reported plan to streamline its operations and sell some assets.
Weyerhaeuser said in July that Wight Nurseries would be one of the operations to go under that plan.
