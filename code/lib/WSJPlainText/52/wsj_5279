Trading volume picked up a bit, but most investors continued to show little appetite for stocks. 

A late blast of computer-guided sell programs erased gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which finished 3.61 lower at 2680.28 after cresting slightly above 2700.
New York Stock Exchange volume of 146,930,000 shares, while still modest, was the highest this week. 

Traders said the program selling hit three big stocks in particular: Coca-Cola, which tumbled 1 1/8 to 61 3/8; Procter & Gamble, which fell 1 3/8 to 121 7/8; and Du Pont, which dropped 7/8 to 117 3/8.
All three are in the Major Market Index, which closely follows the Dow Jones Industrial Average and is frequently used for program trading.
Considerable computer-related activity also came in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures.

"What troubles us is that there has been good news on inflation and the market doesn't want to accept" it, said Robert Buckman, vice president at Brandywine Asset Management.
Brandywine, turning defensive, has bought such cyclical issues as PPG Industries and Dow Chemical.
The firm also has been selling shares of auto makers and buying those of airlines, such as AMR and USAir Group. "We feel airlines are quality companies for the long term," Mr. Buckman said. 

Apparently, so do many other investors.

AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose 3 3/8 to 81 7/8, and UAL, parent of United Airlines, rose 1 1/4 to 286 1/4.
Federal Express, another stock in that average, rose 2 1/2 to 54 1/2 despite a report that its first-quarter earnings fell to 58 cents a share from $1.26 a year earlier.
The company said the drop primarily reflected expenses associated with the acquisition of Tiger International.

A Nomura official said the firm's research staff believes Spain represents one of the most attractive investment opportunities in the European Community.
Spain Fund fell 1 7/8 to 26 7/8 yesterday.
