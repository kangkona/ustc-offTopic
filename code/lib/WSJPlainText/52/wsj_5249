A shareholder in Stratus Computer Inc. filed suit in federal court here, claiming that officers of the company artificially inflated the stock's value by misrepresenting the concern's financial prospects. 

The class-action complaint by Elliot Schwartz, Edison, N.J., follows Stratus' announcement Monday that it expects to post third-quarter net income of 35 cents to 38 cents a share, well below analysts' previous estimates of 47 cents a share. 

The stock, which had been trading at $33.50 a share, plummeted following the announcement.
In national over-the-counter trading, it closed at $24.75 a share, up 50 cents. 

The suit, filed for Mr. Schwartz by the Boston law firm of Shapiro, Grace & Haber, also names as defendants several company officers, including three who allegedly sold shares of Stratus in August. 

A Stratus spokesman wasn't immediately available to comment on the suit. 

A Stratus official on Tuesday said the company became aware Sept. 14 that it wouldn't realize third-quarter expectations, and "made every effort to make the information public as soon as it became available to us." The company has declined to confirm Securities and Exchange Commission figures on stock sales by its executives, reported in The Wall Street Journal Wednesday. 

According to the suit, Mr. Schwartz bought 100 shares of Stratus Aug. 9 at $31.875 a share.
The suit seeks unspecified damages related to the recent fall in the company's share price.
