Assets of 466 money-market mutual funds rose $1.3 billion in the week ended Wednesday, to $348.98 billion, the Investment Company Institute reported. 

"At the present level of assets and yields, over $400 million a week comes just from the interest credited by funds to individual accounts," said Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist at the Washington, D.C.-based trade group. "New money is evidently attracted by stable money-market fund yields and their substantial positive spread over competing instruments." 

Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass., newsletter that tracks fewer funds, earlier this week reported a $2.2 billion increase in assets, to $341.7 billion.
Donoghue's attributed the inflow in part to transfers out of junk bond funds following turmoil in the high-risk, high-yield market late last week. 

According to Donoghue's, the funds it tracks had an average seven-day compound yield, which reflects reinvestment of dividends, of 8.60% in the week ended Tuesday.
That compares to a 7.90% yield on three-month Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction, for example. 

The Investment Company Institute said assets of 141 institutional funds fell by $645.4 million to $84.21 billion in the latest week.
Assets of 230 general purpose funds grew by $1.13 billion to $113.21 billion and the 95 broker-dealer funds increased assets by $815.8 million to $151.56 billion.
