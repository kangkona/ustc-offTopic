Union Carbide Corp. said it is expanding its line of substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons used in making foam cushioning. 

The Danbury, Conn., chemical maker said it has begun to market a group of chemicals, Hyperlite, for making cushions used by the auto industry.
It is also marketing a technology, Geolite, for making cushions used as the backs and arms of furniture. 

Carbide said manufacture of flexible foam cushioning accounts for 10% of worldwide use of CFCs, which are believed to damage the Earth's ozone shield. 

But Steven Gabelman, the product manager, said Geolite in many instances would replace a chemical, methylene chloride, already used as a CFC substitute.
Methylene chloride is a suspected carcinogen.
Mr. Gabelman also said that Hyperlite is meant partly to improve cushions for the auto industry rather than for environmental reasons.
Some makers of these cushions have already learned to make do without CFCs or methylene chloride.
