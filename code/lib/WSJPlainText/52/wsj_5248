Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh, said it received a $45 million contract to supply combustion turbine-generators to a Raytheon Co. unit. 

Westinghouse said United Engineers & Constructors will buy two of its combustion turbines for use in a 300-megawatt power plant it will build for Boston Edison Co. 

The plant, located in Weymouth, Mass., is expected to begin operation in late 1993. 

Westinghouse has interests in electrical products, defense electronics, financial services and broadcasting.
