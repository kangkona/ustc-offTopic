The television units of Paramount Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. said they formed a joint venture to sell advertising in programs syndicated by both companies. 

By pooling shows previously sold individually by MCA and Paramount, the new venture, Premier Advertiser Sales, will account for about one-quarter of the estimated $1 billion in advertising billings for syndicated shows, said Lucie Salhany, president of Paramount Domestic Television. 

The formation of Premier had been expected by the broadcasting industry.
MCA and Paramount have other partnerships, including cable channel USA Network.
Prior to Premier, Paramount had a joint advertising sales venture with Orbis Communications Inc., named International Advertising Sales.
Under the agreement, the new company will continue to represent Orbis shows. 

Shelly Schwab, president of MCA TV, said the two companies complement each other with their programming.
For instance, Paramount specializes in one-hour shows, including "Star Trek: The Next Generation," "Friday the 13th: The Series" and the weeknight "Arsenio Hall Show." Conversely, MCA has a roster of family-oriented half-hour shows, such as "Lassie," "Charles in Charge" and "The Munsters Today." 

Mr. Schwab said the new company will be the fifth-largest seller of advertising time in the broadcasting industry, behind General Electric Co. 's National Broadcasting Co., Capital Cities/ABC Inc., CBS Inc. and News Corp. 's Fox Broadcasting Co. 

Among syndicators, the nearest competitor is Camelot Entertainment Sales, a wholly owned subsidiary of King World Productions Inc. and Buena Vista, a unit of Walt Disney Co.
