United Press International said it and three former senior editors at the newswire dropped all litigation between them. 

The editors, Ben Cason, Barry Sussman and Kim Willenson, resigned in November 1987 amid disputes with UPI's previous owner.
Previous management sued the three men and they filed counterclaims.
The suits have been dismissed with prejudice, meaning that the issues the suits raised can't be litigated again. 

Mr. Cason was senior vice president and editor, while Messrs.
Sussman and Willenson were managing editors.
Milt Capps, a senior vice president at the 82-year-old news service, said that the suits had to do with the terms of the employment contracts the editors signed with previous management.
Under the settlement, neither side will pay the other any money and each side will pay its own legal costs, Mr. Capps said. 

Current management of UPI took over in February 1988.
The company is operated by Infotechnology Inc., a New York information and communications company.
