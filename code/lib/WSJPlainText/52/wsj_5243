Cytel Corp. said it signed a five-year, joint-research agreement valued at more than $30 million with Sandoz AG of Basel, Switzerland, to develop drugs to fight auto-immune diseases and tissue rejection in transplant patients. 

As part of the transaction, Sandoz purchased less than 20% of closely held Cytel, a biotechnology company.
Under the agreement, Cytel will receive funding over a five-year period to support continuing research, and Sandoz will get exclusive world-wide rights to market products developed under the pact.
Among the diseases that the immunological drugs may be used to treat are rheumatoid arthritis and insulin-dependent diabetes.
