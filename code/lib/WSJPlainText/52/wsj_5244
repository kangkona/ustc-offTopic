Capitol Records said David Berman resigned as president, effective today, "to pursue other interests." 

Joe Smith, president and chief executive officer of Capitol's immediate parent, Capitol-EMI Music Inc., will take over Mr. Berman's duties, with a new president for the label to be named soon. 

Capitol is under the umbrella of EMI Music Worldwide, which in turn is a unit of Britain's Thorn EMI PLC. 

Some industry people close to the company said that Mr. Berman, 46 years old, was ousted in a dispute over management styles and future plans for the company with James Fifield, chief executive officer of EMI Music Worldwide.
Others suggested that Mr. Berman may not have turned the company's operations around quickly enough for his boss's liking. 

Industry estimates put Capitol's profit this year at between $9 million and $11 million. 

Mr. Berman declined to comment on his departure, and Mr. Fifield couldn't be reached in New York for comment. 

Mr. Berman was brought in as president of Capitol two years ago when the label was losing money.
Capitol had once made big money with such stars as the Beatles, but it had sufferd in recent years from a lack of top-selling new talent. 

Part of Mr. Berman's strategy focused on reviving the careers of former hitmakers like Bonnie Raitt and the Doobie Brothers, and on cultivating "alternative" groups who don't get much radio airplay now but who could be popular in a few years.
