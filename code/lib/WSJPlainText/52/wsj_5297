Sweden's industrial production fell 3.6% in July from June but was up 0.4% from a year earlier, Statistics Sweden said. 

The national statistics agency said the drop followed a 2.1% increase in June and a 3% decline in May.
However, July figures are always difficult to interpret because of the effects of summer holidays in many industries, it said.
For the first seven months of the year, production was up 4.4% from a year earlier.
