SMOKING HAD BEEN A WORLDLY PLEASURE since Christopher Columbus got the habit from Indians in the New World.
But then came the Jan. 11, 1964, U.S. government report linking tobacco to cancer. 

There had been earlier suspicions and warnings, such as Englishman John Hill's "Cautions Against the Immoderate Use of Snuff" which dealt with snuff sniffers' nose tumors.
But the lankmark assault was issued on a Saturday morning (so the stock market wouldn't be upset) by U.S. Surgeon General Luther L. Terry.
It said that "cigarette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient importance in the U.S. to warrent appropriate remedial action." It cited many fugures including male smokers having 68% higher death rate than nonsmokers. 

The Tobacco Institute, founded in 1958 and funded by tobacco companies, challenged that report and earlier ones such as the 1957 study of the American Cancer Society that linked smoking to lung cancer and heart disease.
And the institute still asserts that there isn't scientific proof that smoking is the villain. 

In 1966 an act of Congress required the first cigarette package health warning ("Caution: Cigarette Smoking May Be Hazardous to Your Health"), but ads didn't have to bear the warning.
On April 1, 1970, TV and radio cigarette ads were banned.
And effective March 30, 1972, all cigarette ads had to carry a health warning. 

Only about 29% of the nation's adults are still puffing, down from 40% in 1965.
Nevertheless, 575 billion cigarettes were burned in the U.S. in 1988, down from a record 640 billion in 1981 but still far above the 397 billion in 1951 when Pall Mall's radio spiel was a hoarse: "Guard against throat scratch, guard against throat scratch."
