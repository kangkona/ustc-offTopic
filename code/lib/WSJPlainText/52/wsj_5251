A&M Records confirmed it is in negotiations to sell the record company to Philips N.V.'s Polygram records unit. 

"Though this transaction has some 30 days to become totally effective, we wanted you to know of this development and how we feel it's in the very best interest of A&M's future," the company's co-chairman and chairman, Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss, said in a note to the A&M staff, which was later disclosed to the media. 

Industry reports put the proposed price for A&M at around $500 million.
