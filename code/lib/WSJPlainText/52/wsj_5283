General Motors Corp. said it is closing for one week its Arlington, Texas, plant that builds the Chevrolet Caprice, Cadillac Brougham and Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser Wagon because of slow sales. 

The move is the latest in a series of such closings at GM and at other domestic auto makers to control inventories of vehicles that aren't in strong demand. 

In an effort to boost sales, GM has been offering $1,000 cash rebates on the 1989 versions of the full-size cars built at Arlington.
In addition, the No. 1 auto maker is offering owners of certain luxury cars $1,000 cash back as an incentive to purchase the 1990-model Brougham. 

The temporary closedown at the Texas facility begins Monday and will idle 4,000 employees. 

Meanwhile, the nine major U.S. auto makers plan to build 154,387 cars this week, up 4.7% from 147,496 a year earlier and 9.1% higher than last week's 141,483. 

GM has scheduled Saturday overtime this week at assembly plants in Lordstown, Ohio; Pontiac, Mich., and St. Louis.
The plants build Chevrolet Cavalier, Pontiac Sunbird, Cadillac De Ville, Oldsmobile 98 Regency and 88 Royale, Buick Electra and Pontiac Bonneville models. 

Chrysler Corp. has scheduled overtime this week at plants in Newark, Del., and St. Louis.
The Newark plant builds the Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim.
The St. Louis plant produces the Plymouth Grand Voyager, Dodge Grand Caravan and extended Dodge Caravan C-V. 

Ford Motor Co. said it isn't planning any overtime or plant idlings this week or next.
