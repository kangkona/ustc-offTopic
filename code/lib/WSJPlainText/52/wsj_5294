Marriott Corp. said it plans to expand its Fairfield Inn chain to 300 units by the mid-1990s through an aggressive franchising program. 

Fairfield, an economy-lodging chain that started operations in October 1987, has 40 units aimed at business and vacation travelers on modest budgets.
Single-occupancy room rates average about $35. 

Marriott, which also has interests in restaurants and contract-food services, already has used the franchising technique successfully to expand its Marriott Hotels & Resorts and Residence Inn chains.
