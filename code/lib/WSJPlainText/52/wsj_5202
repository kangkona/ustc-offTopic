N.V. Philips and its partners have granted a Japanese firm exclusive rights to promote and market equipment for suppliers of a new line of prerecorded audio/visual compact-disk products in Asia. 

The Dutch electronics group said Tokyo-based Century Research Center will begin by marketing authoring equipment it has developed for the so-called CD-I integrated compact-disk audio/visual system to software houses, publishers and video production companies. 

These products will install information, sound and images onto the disks.
A range of CD-I players and pre-recorded disks will become available commercially for professional users sometime next year, a Philips spokesman said. 

Philips's partners in the CD-I project are Sony Corp. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Corp., both of Japan. 

CD-I compact disks are capable of storing not only audio and moving video input, but also graphics and retrievable data on a single five-inch compact disk that would require specialized hardware for playback by the user.
The CD-I systems would utilize video monitors.
