A Japanese retailer purchased a 10% stake in Tiffany & Co. and promised that it wouldn't buy more than 19.9% of the jewelry company's shares outstanding. 

Under the agreement, Mitsukoshi Ltd., a Japanese department store group and principal distributor for Tiffany in Japan, will acquire 1.5 million Tiffany shares from General Electric Capital Corp. Mitsukoshi will hold about 13% of Tiffany after the transaction. 

General Electric Capital, the financial services unit of General Electric Co., will retain 750,000 shares.
It acquired 2.25 million shares in connection with the purchase of Tiffany from Avon Products Inc. in 1984. 

The original GE stake was subject to repurchase by Tiffany but this right was waived by Tiffany in order to permit Mitsukoshi's purchase. 

The transaction is expected to be completed by January, with about 500,000 shares changing hands at the end of this month. 

Tiffany closed yesterday at $52.50, down 75 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

Tiffany, which operates nine stores in the U.S. and a total of five in Asia and Europe, went public in May 1987.
Its stock jumped $6.125 earlier this month on news that investor Donald Trump received clearance to buy more than $15 million of the company's stock.
