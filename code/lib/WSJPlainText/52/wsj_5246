Dennison Manufacturing Co., citing recent softness in its stationery products market, said it expects earnings for the third and fourth quarters to be below year-earlier results and projected net income for 1989 in the $2.30 to $2.40 a share range. 

For 1988, Dennison reported net income of $37.2 million, or $2.35 a share, after a charge from an accounting adjustment of $916,000, on sales of $721.8 million. 

Dennison Chairman Nelson S. Gifford said, "While our market share in the new office products distribution channels continues to show strong growth, we are experiencing recent softness in our traditional stationery markets and as well as in other key businesses." 

The company said it expects third-quarter earnings to be around 40 cents to 50 cents a share, while analysts had estimated earnings of about 55 cents a share for the quarter.
In the year-earlier third quarter, Dennison had net of $8 million, or 51 cents a share, on sales of $176.5 million. 

For the fourth quarter, Dennison said it expects per-share earnings to be 5% to 10% lower than the year-earlier quarter's 89 cents a share, indicating per-share earnings of between 80 cents and 85 cents. 

In last year's fourth quarter, Dennison had net income of $14 million on sales of $198 million.
