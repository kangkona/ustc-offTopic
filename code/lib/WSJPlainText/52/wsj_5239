Cummins Engine Co. said it expects to report a "substantial" third-quarter loss because of sharply lower demand, higher-than-normal warranty costs and production inefficiencies. 

As a result, the company said it plans to cut expenses immediately, including a 5% work force reduction at four Indiana plants.
Production levels for its engine, parts and power system groups will shrink because of reduced demand, the company said.
About 200 workers will be laid off Oct. 1. 

Cummins said income orders for North American heavy-duty trucks have fallen significantly below industry production rates over the past five months.
August's 6,400 orders were the lowest since April 1983, the company said. 

Cummins made its announcement after the stock market closed yesterday.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Cummins closed at $62.625, down 87.5 cents. 

Marine and recreational-vehicle markets also are down, Cummins said.
Sales of generator sets for those markets, served by the company's Onan Corp. unit, are off 38% from the first half of this year, the company said. 

In addition to various expense-reducing measures, the company said it would implement what it called "stringent restrictions on working capital." 

Earlier this week, Cummins shares rose sharply after Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd. raised its stake in the company to 11.5% from 9.9%.
Industrial Equity is an investment vehicle for Sir Ronald Brierley of New Zealand. 

Until now, Cummins had been on an earnings rebound.
The company reported second-quarter profit of $23.9 million, or 83 cents a share, up from $1.7 million a year earlier when preferred dividend requirements exceeded any per-share profit.
Sales gained 18% to $982 million.
