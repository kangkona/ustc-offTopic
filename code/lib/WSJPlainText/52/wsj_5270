Comdisco Inc. said it expects higher earnings for the fourth quarter ending Sept. 30 of $30 million to $32 million, or about 75 cents to 77 cents a share. 

The Rosemont, Ill., company said revenue should rise to between $410 million and $430 million from $351 million a year earlier.
Comdisco earned $27 million, or 64 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1988. 

A spokesman for the company said the strength will come from the re-marketing of its computer portfolio, which consists of International Business Machines Corp. mainframe equipment and the equipment of other computer companies. 

The spokesman said the secondary market has been "running at peak levels this year," reflecting a stagnant economy.
He added that "it's been a very good year for the used-equipment market," making it a "viable alternative" to new equipment. 

Comdisco stock rose 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $32.75 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
