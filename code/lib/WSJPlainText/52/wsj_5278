The Resolution Trust Corp. placed four insolvent Texas thrifts into the agency's conservatorship program and transferred their deposits, offices and certain liabilities into four newly chartered institutions. 

The four are: East Texas Savings & Loan Association, Tyler, which had $367.8 million in assets; Plano Savings & Loan Association, Plano, with $274.4 million in assets; First Savings & Loan Association, Brenham, with $148.4 million in assets; and First Garland Savings Association, with $134.3 million in assets. 

While under the conservatorship program, the thrifts will be operated by RTC managing agents, and the agency will be trying to negotiate permanent resolutions for the institutions.
