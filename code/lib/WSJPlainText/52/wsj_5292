In response to your Aug. 31 editorial "Academic Protectionism," let me assure you that the Board of Overseers of the Hoover Institution does not intend to allow Stanford University "to gain control of Hoover and its abundant resources." 

We will only approve a candidate for director of the institution who is fully committed to maintaining Hoover's independence and scholarly integrity -- and to ensuring Hoover's continued role as a world-class research organization dedicated to free markets, free institutions and the free exchange of ideas. 

I'd also like to correct one error: The Journal reports Hoover's endowment as $300 million; in fact, it is $125 million.
But you are quite right to credit Glenn Campbell's leadership for the impressive growth of that endowment from $2 million in 1960 to $125 million today.

Some of the disappointing things to me in the past few years of my directorship of the Hoover Institution were the intolerance and the attempts to stifle free speech, not to mention takeover attempts that developed on the Stanford campus.
It is particularly ironic (then again, perhaps it is not]) that President Donald Kennedy would allow this to take place, since the motto of Stanford University is "Let the winds of freedom blow." 

If President Kennedy and the trustees do not demonstrate more fortitude in the next three or four years, the Hoover Institution will become completely independent and still be in the middle of the Stanford campus -- as the university needs the Hoover Institution more than the Hoover Institution needs Stanford.
