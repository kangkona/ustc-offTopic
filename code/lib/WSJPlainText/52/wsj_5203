Harvard University said three of its admissions officers would stop selling information to Harvard and other colleges through a data-processing company they control. 

Harvard's relationship with the company, Student Aid Services Inc., was criticized by some educators in the wake of a Justice Department inquiry of possible tuition and financial-aid price-fixing among private colleges.
SAS has helped 23 private schools exchange data on financial aid awards to common admittees, in a process that eliminates differences in the students' out-of-pocket tuition expenses. 

The process, called "overlap," is part of the Justice Department inquiry. 

The Harvard administrators involved with SAS are Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons, Assistant Dean of Admissions Warren C. Reed and Director of Financial Aid James S. Miller. 

A. Michael Spence, dean of Harvard's faculty of arts and sciences, said in a statement yesterday that the university saw nothing wrong with its administrators' involvement in SAS, but was acting to avoid "even the semblance of inappropriate activities" by Harvard or the individuals involved. 

Through Harvard, Messrs.
Fitzsimmons, Reed and Miller declined comment.
Walter Moulton, a fourth principal in SAS and director of student aid at Bowdoin College, in Brunswick, Maine, also declined comment, saying he hadn't seen Harvard's statement.
