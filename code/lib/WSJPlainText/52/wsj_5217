Emulex Corp. said it expects to report lower-than-expected sales and net income for the Oct. 1 first quarter. 

The maker of computer data storage equipment and computer interfaces said it is finding slower sales than expected in all market segments. 

Analysts have been projecting a drop in results, forecasting net at between 13 cents and 17 cents a share and sales at between $32 million and $35 million.
In the year-earlier period, Emulex earned $3.5 million, or 30 cents a share, on $36.1 million in sales. 

However, the company now expects even lower results than those forecasts, although it still expects to be profitable, a spokeswoman said.
These trends probably will continue through the fiscal second quarter.
However, an upturn is expected in the fiscal third and fourth quarters, based on products introduced last month, she said. 

The spokeswoman said that volume shipment of the new products isn't expected until the latter part of the fiscal year, although shipments in small quantities have brought a good response. 

As a result of lower results in the first half, Emulex expects fiscal 1990 net and sales to be lower than the $13.3 million, or $1.15 a share, and $148.7 million sales reported for fiscal 1989.
