Anchor Glass Container Corp., fighting a takeover bid from a Mexican company, said a special committee of its board has determined that Anchor should be sold in its entirety. 

Anchor, which has said it has been talking to third parties, said that based on the "interests indicated" by those parties, the company's sale would be the best method for improving value for Anchor shareholders.
The company said the results of its efforts to sell the entire company should be known by the end of October. 

Since August, Anchor, a Tampa., Fla., maker of bottles and glass containers, has been the object of a takeover attempt by Vitro S.A., a Monterrey, Mexico-based glass-making giant.
A second extension by Vitro of its $20-a-share, or $251.4 million, tender offer expired yesterday. 

A Vitro spokesman wouldn't comment on Anchor's decision.
