Norton Opax PLC, a British specialty printer, said it decided to recommend that its shareholders accept a #382 million ($605 million) takeover bid for the company by Bowater Industries PLC. 

The board's decision was widely expected. 

Bowater, a British paper and packaging manufacturer that already owns 29% of Norton Opax, launched its bid Sept. 4, in part to thwart Norton Opax's efforts to take over a rival U.K. specialty printer, De La Rue Co. 

Norton Opax dropped its #688 million hostile bid for De La Rue last Thursday when it became apparent that Bowater and its other shareholders would vote against the move at a forthcoming general meeting.
