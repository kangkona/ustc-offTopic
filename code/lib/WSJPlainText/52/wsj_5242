The company had earnings last year of $4.8 million on sales of $55.2 million. 

The duty-free shops are located in Washington, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota and Minnesota.
The ship supply and wholesale business is in Seattle.
Sales from these businesses are estimated at $23 million to $30 million. 

The sellers, Kenneth L. Kellar Exports Inc. and Exports of Washington Inc., are both owned by Kenneth L. Kellar, a Blaine, Wash., businessman.
