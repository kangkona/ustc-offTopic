KEISHI OGURA OF NEW JAPAN RADIO developed an improved electron tube in 1964 and Raytheon, the U.S. pioneer in microwave ovens, three years later had a product that has become a kitchen icon. 

Raytheon, which used a 1939 British design to make radar equipment to detect enemy planes during World War II, had purchased a one-third interest in New Japan Radio in 1961 and made its tube designs available to the Japanese concern.
In 1942, a Raytheon inventor, Percy L. Spencer, noted that a chocolate bar melted in his pocket while he was testing a radar tube.
He then cut a hole in a kettle, inserted an electron tube and by 1949 Raytheon patented its "Radarange." 

Designed for restaurants, the early 1953 models were oversized, cost about $3,000 and turned out bilious grey meat and limp french fries.
They were duds for about a decade, remaining alien to many consumers.
The Irish cook of Charles Adams, Raytheon's chairman who turned his kitchen into a proving ground, called the ovens "black magic" and quit. 

But Ogura's simple electron tube made it possible for Amana Refrigeration, an Iowa concern acquired by Raytheon in 1965, to make a practical, compact microwave oven that was introduced in 1967 at an affordable $495 for busy people seeking fast meals. 

Some consumers were afraid of the early ovens.
A 1968 scare, when Walter Reed Hospital tested new ovens and found radiation leakage, led to federal standards in 1971. 

Today, Asian companies are the dominant producers of the oven's working innards.
But Sears Roebuck's Kenmore is the largest U.S. market brand followed by Japan's Sharp and by General Electric.
Last year, nearly 11 million microwave ovens came to the U.S. market, off from the record 12.6 million in 1987 but far above the 314,000 in 1972.
