Bankers Trust New York Corp. underwrote a $150 million senior note issue for MorningStar Foods Inc., marking the first time a banking company has been the sole underwriter of a public corporate debt issue. 

The below-investment grade issue for the Dallas-based dairy company was brought to market by Bankers Trust's BT Securities unit.
Last summer, Bankers Trust and three other banks were cleared by the Federal Reserve Board to underwrite and deal to a limited extent in public issues of corporate debt securities. 

MorningStar, purchased from Southland Corp. in a leveraged buy-out, will use the proceeds from the issue to pay off bank debt.
Bankers Trust owns 4.9% of MorningStar's common shares.
