Brent Walker Group PLC, a U.K. entertainment, betting and leisure group, reported a 95% jump in pretax profit at midyear, fueled by acquisitions that have trebled the company's net assets over the past year. 

Pretax profit for the 28 weeks to July 16 rose to #30 million ($47.5 million) from #15.4 million ($24.4 million) in the year-earlier period. 

Profit after taxes leaped 98% to #24.4 million from #12.3 million, while earnings per share jumped to 39.17 pence (62 cents) from 15.01 pence (24 cents). 

Brent Walker has gone on a buying spree over the past year, acquiring the wines and spirits business of Lonrho PLC for #180 million and public houses, or "pubs," from Ellerman Holdings Ltd. and Grand Metropolitan PLC for a combined #286.5 million. 

Its purchases also included distilling operations and a small British film studio.
Altogether, the purchases helped lift Brent Walker's net assets at the end of the first half to #738 million from #237 million a year earlier.
