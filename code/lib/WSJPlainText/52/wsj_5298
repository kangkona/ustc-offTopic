Horizon Financial Services Inc. said it offered to buy Northern Savings & Loan Co. of Elyria, Ohio, for about $14.2 million. 

Terms include paying holders $65 a share in cash, although Horizon may use its shares as part of the purchase price. 

Horizon said the offer could be lowered based on any added expense incurred in a lawsuit by Northern against Horizon.
Earlier this month, Horizon wrote to Northern holders with a bid, but Northern sued, claiming Horizon broke securities laws.
Horizon has withdrawn its previous offer. 

Horizon's current offer is set to expire Sept. 25, if Northern hasn't accepted it.
