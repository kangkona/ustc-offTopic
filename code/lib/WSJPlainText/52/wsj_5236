PPG Industries Inc. said it agreed to buy Clorox Co. 's two paint subsidiaries for $130 million, doubling its consumer paint business. 

The units are Olympic HomeCare Products and Lucite HomeCare Products, which have combined annual paint and stain sales of about $100 million. 

The transaction is subject to government approval and other conditions. 

The planned purchase gives PPG, a maker of glass, chemicals and coatings, broader distribution for its consumer paints, which analysts say have lagged its industrial and automotive coatings. 

PPG's Pittsburgh Paints brand is distributed through independent dealers, while the Olympic and Lucite products will open up the home-center market for PPG. That's important because of stiff retail competition among paint makers, according to analysts. 

For Clorox, an Oakland, Calif., household-products concern, the sale price is a discount, considering the two brands were purchased for about $173 million in separate transactions in 1981 and 1983.
However, the acquisitions did include other units, such as a plastic molding business, which have been sold previously. 

But analysts consider Clorox's performance in the paint business mediocre. "The two businesses were almost destined to fail," says James Wilbur, analyst at Smith Barney Harris Upham & Co.
One reason, he suggests, was Clorox's marketing approach that put too much emphasis on advertising brand names. 

Mr. Wilbur says that consumers tend to buy whatever paint is offered in a local store rather than shop until they find a certain brand. "You can't use mass advertising to drag people in," he adds. 

Clorox officials say they decided to get out of the paint business so they could focus on the company's household and grocery-products operations. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Clorox closed at $41.625, up $1, while PPG slipped 37.5 cents to $44.375.
