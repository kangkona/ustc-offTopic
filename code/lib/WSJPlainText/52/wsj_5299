Your Aug. 22 article "Copycat Flashlight Firms Are Hit by Battery of Suits" drew much attention to the growing problem of illegal copyright and patent infringements. 

I, too, have spent countless hours and more than $2 million defending the patent for my invention -- the accordion-folding, cardboard car shade -- in courts across the country. 

What the article didn't explain is that a patent certificate is the only U.S. government-sanctioned document that is virtually useless in court.
A patent certificate merely gives an inventor an exhibit to add to his complaint.
But, time and again, the inventor must bear the burden of proving in every lawsuit that the invention's patent is justifiably granted.
It seems to me this legal demand is unfair. 

I applaud the efforts of Rep. Richard Gephardt to broaden protection on designs of U.S. products from foreign manufacturers.
However, the problem is also acute domestically where hundreds of copycat operations are stealing the intellectual property of others.
