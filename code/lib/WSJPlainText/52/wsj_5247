Unocal Corp., Los Angeles, said it will build a polymer emulsion plant in Kankakee, Ill., replacing and doubling capacity lost last year in an explosion and fire that destroyed a company facility in Bridgeview, Ill. 

The cost of the new facility wasn't disclosed.
Unocal said the new plant, slated to begin production late next year, will have a total capacity of 180 million pounds a year of polyvinyl acetate and styrene butadiene-emulsions that are used to make latex paint, paper coatings, adhesives and textile finishes. 

Unocal currently has an annual production capacity for these products totaling between 600 million and 650 million pounds, a spokesman said.
The plant destroyed last year had a capacity of 100 million pounds.
