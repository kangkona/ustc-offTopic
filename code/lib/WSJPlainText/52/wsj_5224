Treasury bond prices fell late yesterday as the government prepares to auction a large supply of new securities. 

The Treasury will auction $32 billion in securities next week, including $9.75 billion in two-year notes and $7.75 billion in four-year notes.
The size of the auctions was increased over recent similar auctions. 

"The prospect of more supply is what's hurting the market," said William M. Brachfeld, executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc. 

The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1/4 point, or about $2.50, for each $1,000 face amount.
The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 8.18% from 8.16%. 

Bond prices were 1/4 point higher in overnight trading in Tokyo and retained the gains when trading began in the U.S.
One dealer said Japanese investors were "bargain hunting" in the U.S. securities market, buying primarily 10-year notes and 30-year bonds on hopes that those securities would rebound if the U.S. dollar starts to rise again. 

"There was a small amount of activity in Japan very early, but it looks like they were wrong," in betting that the dollar would push the market higher, said Mr. Brachfeld. 

Bond dealers said the selling spree began in the bond futures trading pit, where sell orders were triggered after prices slipped below key technical support levels.
The sell-off quickly spread to the cash market. 

Also weighing on Treasury prices were rumors that the Resolution Funding Corp. will soon announce details of its first bond offering.
Refcorp is a new agency created to raise money for the thrift industry bailout.
The Treasury has said the agency will issue about $30 billion in securities over the next two fiscal years, possibly starting as soon as next month. 

But yesterday, traders heard rumors that the size of the auction may be raised to as much as $50 billion.
A Treasury spokesman denied the rumors. 

Philip Braverman, a New York financial economist, said many analysts doubted the credibility of the rumors throughout the day.
But he noted that just the slight chance that the rumors were true "kept a lot of buyers away." 

"There seemed to be misinformed rumors about Refcorp," said F. Ward McCarthy of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates Inc. "One of the rumors was that Refcorp was going to announce a $5 billion zero coupon issue, possibly as early as today." 

Mr. McCarthy said talk has been circulating in the credit market for the past several weeks that Refcorp will start to raise funding for the thrift bailout by selling $5 billion of 30-year bonds during the first half of October, and not zero coupon bonds. 

The federal government's thrift bailout plan put "on-budget," for fiscal 1989 ending Sept. 30, $20 billion of the $50 billion needed toward the eventual $166 billion thrift bailout cost.
The additional $30 billion will be raised through bonds issued by Refcorp and won't be counted as part of the federal budget. 

The Treasury has been raising the sizes of its regularly scheduled bill and note sales and has also held cash management bill sales recently to help raise the initial $20 billion that is "on-budget." 

On the economic front, the Commerce Department today will release the latest data on personal income and personal consumption expenditures.
Although economists expect the report to show signs of economic weakness, the data are not likely to have much impact on the bond market. 

"These data should show more signs of an economy that is decelerating," says Mr. McCarthy.
However, he added, "the market is either looking for real strength or negative numbers.
It doesn't have the patience right now to accept the gradual slowing we're seeing in the economy." 

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report expect, on average, a 0.3% gain in last month's personal income.
Personal consumption expenditures are expected to have increased 0.8%.
In July, both personal income and personal consumption expenditures advanced 0.7%. 

In the corporate bond market, the banking industry crossed a major milestone when Bankers Trust New York Corp. became the first commercial bank to lead an underwriting group for a corporate bond offering since the early 1930s. 

BT Securities, the securities unit of Bankers Trust, was chosen as underwriter for a $150 million junk bond offering of seven-year notes by MorningStar Foods Inc., a Dallas-based producer and distributor of dairy products. 

Bankers Trust and several other major banks were given authority in recent months by the Federal Reserve to underwrite corporate debt to a limited degree.
Several banks have been included in underwriting groups for corporate bonds, but until yesterday none had been designated as a lead manager. 

Treasury Securities 

Treasury securities fell in light trading.
The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late in the day at a price of 99 07/32 compared with 99 15/32 Wednesday.
The latest 10-year notes were quoted at 98 20/32 to yield 8.19% compared with 98 25/32 to yield 8.16%. 

The government sold $9.51 billion of one-year Treasury bills yesterday at an average rate of 7.61%. 

The Treasury received bids totaling $25.56 billion for the bills and accepted $9.51 billion, including $469.9 million of noncompetitive tenders at the average return. 

Here are details of yesterday's auction: 

Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value.
Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.
The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year. 

The bills are dated Sept. 28 and mature Sept. 27, 1990. 

Corporate Issues 

Corporate bonds ended about 1/2 point lower. 

The new-issue market took a breather after Wednesday's heavy round of corporate debt issuance.
Less than $300 million in new corporate debt was issued yesterday, a significant reduction from Wednesday's total debt issuance of more than $2 billion. 

Among the new issues that came to market was a $150 million 12-year note offering by Kaiser Permanente, a non-governmental prepaid health care delivery system.
An underwriting syndicate led by First Boston Corp. priced the notes at par to yield 9%. 

Household Finance Corp. revisited the corporate debt market with an $100 million offering of 12-year senior subordinated notes.
A group led by Morgan Stanley & Co. won the securities through competitive bidding, and was reoffering the notes to investors at a price to yield 9.101%.
In the high-yield market, issues of Resorts International Inc. continued to slide on Tuesday's news that the company has proposed an exchange offer for junior and senior debtholders. 

The biggest loser was Resorts' 10% subordinated debentures of 1999, which lost 3 1/2 points to close below its year's low at 24.
Another issue, the 10% subordinated debentures of 1998, fell two points to finish the session at 24 1/2.
That issue had dropped below its low of the year in trading Wednesday. 

At a bondholders meeting earlier this week, Resorts said it will offer bondholders a package of new subordinated secured debt due in 1999, some cash, and common stock in exchange for the firm's junior and senior debt.
If all debentures are exchanged, bondholders would receive a 25% equity stake in the company. 

Meanwhile, prices of junk bond issues across the board were almost unchanged in what dealers said was quiet trading. "We are up from the bottoms," said one trader. "But I wouldn't describe it as a screaming, buying market." 

Foreign Bonds 

West German government bonds ended weaker even though the policy-making unit of the Deutsche Bundesbank left important interest rates unchanged. 

The market's weakness reflects growing sentiment that the central bank will eventually push interest rates higher.
Economists contend that inflation is likely to rise in West Germany in the coming months as buoyant demand exceeds industrial capacity.
Another concern, they said, is that some measures of the nation's money supply remain above target. 

Bonn's 6 3/4% issue due June 1999 ended at 99.10, down 0.15 to yield 6.87% while the 6 3/4% notes due 1994 fell 0.03 to 98.9 to yield 7.02%. 

The prospect of higher rates in West Germany also hurt Great Britain's government bond market.
The Treasury's benchmark 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 fell 2/32 to 113 9/32 to yield 9.91% while the 12% notes due 1995 fell 2/32 to 104 22/32 to yield 10.80%. 

In Japan, government bonds ended unchanged.
The benchmark No. 111 4.6% issue due 1998 ended on brokers' screens at 95.67 to yield 5.325%, the same as Wednesday. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities 

Mortgage securities fell 5/32 to 6/32 but held up better than intermediate Treasurys, which were off as much as 1/4 point. 

Traders said there was fairly strong investor buying of mortgage issues as many institutions continued to adopt a more favorable market view following the problems in the mortgage sector earlier this year caused by heavy thrift selling. 

Among major mortgage issues, Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for October delivery ended at 97 4/32, down 6/32; and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9% securities at 96 11/32, down 5/32. 

Ginnie Mae 9% securities were yielding 9.53% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above Treasury 10-year note narrowed .01 percentage point to 1.34. 

Municipals 

Municipal bonds finished narrowly mixed, having finally stabilized after the tumble earlier this week. 

Actively traded municipals finished about 1/8 point lower to 1/8 higher in light trading. 

While the market attracted a flurry of bargain hunting, municipal bonds were still burdened by worries about the heavy supply flooding the market, traders said. 

Underwriters led by Lazard Freres & Co. made allotments on $891 million of Dormitory Authority of the State of New York bonds.
The issue, launched Tuesday, was increased that day from the originally scheduled size of $874 million, the underwriter said. 

Meanwhile, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 finished 1/8 lower at 96 1/4, yielding 7.50%.
