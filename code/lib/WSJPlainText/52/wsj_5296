Your Aug. 18 article "Companies, Unions Wish Many Happy Returns as Birthday Gifts Flood Ways and Means Panel" distorts the U.S. Capitol Historical Society's project to commemorate the bicentennial of the House Ways and Means Committee.
I'd like to set the record straight. 

First, the U.S. Capitol Historical Society initiated this project.
We developed plans to write a scholarly history of the committee for its bicentennial.
We contracted with the respected documentary film producer Steven York to produce a film on the committee's history and functions.
We devised the fund-raising appeal.
I personally drafted, signed and sent out fund-raising letters. 

Second, the article strongly suggests that donors to this project were buying access to the committee.
The charge should be preposterous on its face.
How could these donors buy access to the committee when the money was given to the society to produce a scholarly book and documentary film?
I deeply resent any intimation that any influence was exerted on this project.
The authors of the book, Donald Kennon (Ph.
D. from the University of Maryland) and Rebecca M. Rogers (M.A. from American University) are distinguished congressional scholars.
Mr. York has a proven track record for producing objective, unbiased documentaries.
The book and the film can speak for themselves. 

The writing of the book was reviewed by a panel of historians and political scientists from the Library of Congress, Johns Hopkins University and the University of Wisconsin.
Unanimously, they have found the book to be an asset to understanding the history of the U.S. Congress. 

I take my hat off to Chairman Dan Rostenkowski.
Rather than be criticized for twisting arms or patting himself on the back, Rep. Rostenkowski should be praised by all of those for whom Congress is an institution deserving of serious study.
