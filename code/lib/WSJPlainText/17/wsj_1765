BankAmerica Corp. reported a 34% jump in third-quarter earnings, as its rocket-like recovery from nearly ruinous losses several years ago continued to be fueled by growth in consumer loans, higher interest margins and negligible loan losses. 

For the quarter, BankAmerica said it earned $254 million, or $1.16 a share, compared with $190 million, or 97 cents a share, a year earlier. 

BankAmerica spokesmen said preliminary reports indicate the company wasn't materially affected by the Tuesday earthquake.
All but eight of the 850 branches, which had some structural damage, reopened yesterday for business.
Automated teller machine operations also were up and operating yesterday, a bank spokesman said. 

For the first time in nearly two years, BankAmerica results failed to improve in consecutive quarters, but the decline from the second quarter was attributable to special factors.
Third-quarter profit was 16% below the $304 million, or $1.50 a share, earned in the 1989 second quarter. 

The company cited higher tax credits in the second quarter, totaling $63 million, compared with $28 million in the third quarter.
Excluding tax credits, profit was 6% below the second quarter.
But that drop was caused entirely by a decline in Brazilian interest paid, to $5 million from $54 million the second quarter. 

Moreover, BankAmerica continued to build its reserve against troubled foreign loans by boosting its loan-loss provision to $170 million, about the same as the previous quarter but well above the $100 million in the year-earlier quarter.
The provision rate was far above BankAmerica's actual net credit losses of $24 million in the third quarter, compared with $18 million in the second period and $38 million a year earlier. 

As a result, BankAmerica said its reserve against troubled foreign-country loans, once below 25%, now amounts to 45% of the $6.4 billion of non-trade debt it calculates it is owed by those nations.
That level is about the same as some other big banks, but far below the 85% and 100% reserves of Bankers Trust New York Corp. and J.P. Morgan & Co., respectively. 

By any measure, third-quarter earnings were still robust, equivalent to a 0.92% return on assets even excluding tax credits.
By that key measure of operating efficiency, BankAmerica turned in a better performance than its well-regarded Los Angeles-based competitor, Security Pacific Corp., which posted a 0.89% return in the third quarter.
But it continued to badly trail its San Francisco neighbor, Wells Fargo & Co., which reported an extraordinary 1.25% return on assets.
Both returns don't include any tax credits. 

"They {BankAmerica} continue to show good performance," said Donald K. Crowley, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., San Francisco.
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, BankAmerica common stock edged up 12.5 cents to close at $32 a share. 

Shareholder equity improved to 4.68% from 4.23% in the previous quarter.
The 4.52% net interest margin, or the difference between the yield on a bank's investments and the rate it pays for deposits and other borrowings, was still markedly higher than the 3.91% ratio a year earlier, and is among the best in the industry, analysts said. 

The high margin partly stems from continued strong growth in high-yielding consumer loans, which jumped 31% to $17.47 billion from a year earlier, and residential mortgages, which rose 25% to $12 billion.
BankAmerica's total loans rose 8% to $71.36 billion. 

For the nine months, BankAmerica profit soared 81% to $833 million, or $4.07 a share, from $461 million, or $2.40 a share.
