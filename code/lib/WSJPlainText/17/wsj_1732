Hotel Investors Trust and its affiliate, Hotel Investors Corp., said the companies plan to sell all of the hotels the companies own and operate, except for two hotel-casinos in Las Vegas, Nev. 

The hotels and management interests will be sold at an auction, said John Rothman, president and chief executive officer of the trust and a director of the corporation.
Value of the properties and management interests wasn't disclosed. 

In all, the Los Angeles-based trust plans to sell its interests in 36 hotels, while the corporation will sell its management interests in 32 of those properties. 

Excluded from the sale are the interests of the trust and the corporation in two Las Vegas hotel-casinos. 

After completing the sale and paying debts, the trust and corporation will consider a number of options including a stock repurchase, payment of special dividend or investment in more gaming properties.
The companies will retain their current regular quarterly dividend of 25 cents during the sale process, Mr. Rothman said. 

For the first six months, the trust and corporation had a net loss of $244,000.
