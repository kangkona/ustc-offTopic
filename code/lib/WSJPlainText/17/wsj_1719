Amdura Corp. said its bank group, led by Chicago-based Continental Bank, agreed to extend its $40 million bridge loan until March 31, 1990, and gave it a new $30 million credit line. 

Under terms of the loan agreement, Amdura said it will omit the next quarterly dividends on its Series A, B, C and D preferred shares, which are due Nov. 15.
Since the preferred stock is cumulative, Amdura said it will pay all omitted dividends, which range from $1.19 to $4.88 a share, when debt-reduction requirements have been met. 

Amdura's bridge loan, part of the financing for Amdura's acquisition of CoastAmerica in December 1988, was to come due next Friday.
The company's new management, which took control of Amdura's board after a consent solicitation last month, wanted to extend the loan while it tries to sell two units.
Proceeds from those sales will be used to reduce debt. 

Amdura, a Denver hardware and automotive distributor, said the new credit agreement will provide the working capital needed to meet ongoing requirements.
