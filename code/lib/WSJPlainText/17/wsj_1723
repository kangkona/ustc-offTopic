Tokyo stocks closed higher in moderately active but directionless trading as the recent anxiety in world stock markets continued to fade. 

London shares also closed firmer in thin trading driven largely by technical factors and support from a new Wall Street rally.
Prices also rose on almost every other major exchange in Europe, Asia and the Pacific. 

Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 issues, which gained 111.48 points Wednesday, climbed 266.66, or 0.76%, to 35374.22.
Volume on the first section was estimated at 800 million shares, compared with 841 million Wednesday.
Winners outnumbered losers 645-293, with 186 issues unchanged. 

In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index rose 170.65 points, to 35544.87. 

On Thursday, the Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the first section, which gained 0.24 point Wednesday, was up 22.78, or 0.86%, at 2665.66. 

The morning session was dominated by individuals and dealers, but some institutions participated in the afternoon, encouraged by the market's firmness, traders said.
Sentiment was helped by the small gain made by New York stocks Wednesday despite anxiety over possible effects of the major earthquake that struck northern California Tuesday. 

Having survived both last Friday's 6.9% Wall Street plunge and the immediate aftermath of the San Francisco Bay area earthquake, Tokyo market participants expressed relief that trading had returned to normal. 

Hiroyuki Murai, general manager of the stock trading division at Nikko Securities, said that after looking at the reasons for Friday's Wall Street plunge, participants realized that the Tokyo and New York markets have different economic fundamentals.
This conclusion, he said, restored the credibility of Tokyo stocks. 

Yoshiaki Mitsuoka, head of the investment information department at Daiwa Investment Trust & Management, said that if New York stocks just fluctuate in or near their current range, the Tokyo market will remain firm with a moderately upward trend for the rest of the year. 

But traders said the market lacks a base on which to set long-term buying strategy, as the future direction of U.S. interest rates remains unclear. 

"Investor interest switches back and forth ceaselessly as they are unable to shift their weight to one side for sure," Mr. Mitsuoka of Daiwa Investment Trust said. 

Many of Wednesday's winners were losers yesterday as investors quickly took profits and rotated their buying to other issues, traders said. 

Pharmaceuticals made across-the-board advances.
Fujisawa Pharmaceutical gained 130 to 1,930 yen ($13.64) a share, Mochida Pharmaceutical was up 150 at 4,170, and Eisai advanced 60 to 2,360. 

Housing issues were boosted by a report that Daiwa House expects to post 43% higher earnings for its latest fiscal year, traders said.
Daiwa House advanced 100 to 2,610, Misawa Homes was up 60 at 2,940, and Sekisui House gained 100 to 2,490. 

Leading construction companies also attracted interest for their strong earnings outlooks, traders said.
They and many other major Japanese corporations will issue results soon for the fiscal first half ended Sept. 30.
Ohbayashi was up 60 to close at 1,680, Shimizu gained 50 to 2,120, and Kumagai-Gumi advanced 40 to 1,490. 

Other winners included real estate issues Mitsubishi Estate, which closed at 2,500, up 130, and Mitsui Real Estate Development, which gained 100 to 2,890. 

Steel shares fell back after advancing for three days.
Kawasaki Steel was down 11 at 788, Kobe Steel lost 5 to 723, and Nippon Steel slipped 6 to 729. 

Mitsubishi Rayon, a leading advancer Wednesday, fell 44 to 861 as investors grabbed profits. 

London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 19.2 points higher at 2189.3.
The Financial Times 30-share index ended 13.6 higher at 1772.1.
Volume continued to ease from the active dealings at the start of the week.
Turnover was 382.9 million shares, compared with 449.3 million Wednesday. 

Dealers said the market was underpinned by a squeeze in FT-SE 100 stocks, particularly among market-makers seeking shares that had been hit hard in recent weeks, such as retailers and building-related concerns. 

But despite the flurry of interest in those shares, dealers said, the market remains nervous about Wall Street's volatility and high U.K. interest rates. 

U.K. money supply figures for September, released yesterday, showed continued growth in corporate and personal lending, which will keep pressure on the government to maintain tight credit. 

Among the stocks featured in the market-makers' squeeze was Sears, which closed at 107 pence ($1.70) a share, up 3. 

General Universal Stores, another top-tier stock hit recently by concerns over retail demand in the face of high interest rates, gained 20 to #10.44.
Storehouse gained 2 to 

Another active FT-SE 100 stock was clothing and furniture retailer Burton, which gained 6 to 196. 

Insurers recovered ground again on market-maker demand and speculative buying linked to talk of mergers in the industry before the European Community's planned market unification in 

Royal Insurance was the sector's hottest issue, ending 15 higher at 465.
Sun Alliance fell 1 to close at 289, and General Accident jumped 10 to #10.13. 

B.A.T Industries surged in afternoon dealings after its shareholders approved a plan to dispose of its U.S. and U.K. retailing operations to fend off Hoylake Investment's #13.4 billion ($21.33 billion) hostile bid.
With the company also exercising a plan to buy back as many as 10% of its shares outstanding, B.A.T closed at 783, up 27.
Turnover was 6.8 million shares, including about four million shares traded in the afternoon after the shareholders' meeting.
B.A.T said it purchased 2.5 million shares at 785. 

In other European markets, shares closed sharply higher in Stockholm, Frankfurt, Zurich and Paris and higher in Milan, Amsterdam and Brussels.
South African gold stocks closed firmer. 

Prices also closed higher in Singapore, Sydney, Taipei, Wellington, Hong Kong and Manila but were lower in Seoul.
