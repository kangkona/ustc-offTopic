Clinton Gas Systems Inc. said it received a contract from Timken Co., Canton, Ohio, to manage the natural gas purchasing, scheduling and transportation activities for Timken's seven Ohio and two Pennsylvania plants. 

Clinton and Timken agreed not to disclose the value of the contract. 

Timken, a producer of bearings and specialty steel, already buys gas from Clinton. 

Clinton said in Columbus, Ohio, that its Clinton Gas Marketing unit wants to line up a number of such gas management contracts.
Manufacturers frequently don't have anyone who is a specialist in natural gas, Clinton said, and a specialist such as Clinton can save them substantial amounts of money.
