The federal response to California's earthquake crisis was marred by coast-to-coast name-calling between the White House and San Francisco's Mayor Art Agnos. 

Mr. Agnos complained that he was "ticked off" that Vice President Dan Quayle, who toured the earthquake site Wednesday, didn't schedule a private meeting with him.
The mayor said the Quayle visit was "a publicity stunt." 

The White House said Mr. Quayle's staff had invited the mayor to two meetings of the vice president and groups of local officials and had offered to dispatch a helicopter to pick him up.
Mr. Agnos declined the invitations, the White House said. 

Marlin Fitzwater, White House press secretary, also asserted that Mr. Agnos had failed to return telephone calls from John Sununu, White House chief of staff. "We regret very much that the mayor of San Francisco has decided not to cooperate with us on this matter in making sure that there is adequate federal support for the disaster in his city," Mr. Fitzwater said. 

By late yesterday, both sides appeared prepared to bury the hatchet.
The White House announced that Mr. Agnos, along with the mayors of Oakland and Alameda, are to accompany President Bush on a tour of the earthquake area today.
And one White House official reported that Mr. Agnos had been "very helpful" in making arrangements for Mr. Bush's hastily scheduled trip to California.
