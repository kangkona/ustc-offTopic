Control Data Corp. said it licensed its airline yield-management software to the International Air Transport Association.
Terms include a royalty arrangement, but details weren't disclosed. 

The computer equipment and financial services company said IATA, a trade group, will sell access to the package to its 180 airline members world-wide.
Control Data will receive revenue linked to the number of passengers served by the software, IATA said. 

The package helps carriers solve pricing problems, such as how to react to discounts offered by competitors or what would be the optimum number of seats to offer at a given price.
