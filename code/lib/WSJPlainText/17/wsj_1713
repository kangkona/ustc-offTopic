NATIONWIDE HEALTH PROPERTIES, Pasadena, Calif., said it wouldn't pay its fourth-quarter dividend, despite a 44% increase in third-quarter earnings, to $3.5 million, or 42 cents a share.
Net income included a gain of $708,000 on asset sales, the real estate investment trust said.
A year earlier, Nationwide Health earned $2.4 million, or 29 cents a share.
Revenue rose 3% to $9 million from $8.8 million.
Nationwide Health said that although it has the cash to cover the 25-cent-a-share dividend, its banks have denied the company's request to pay it because the trust hasn't met certain terms.
Nationwide Health said it has "numerous financing activities" under way to remedy the problem and will make up the dividend payment later if possible.
