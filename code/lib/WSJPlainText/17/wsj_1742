Sony Corp., New York, said its bids for Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. and Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. have been cleared by federal antitrust regulators. 

The Japanese company said the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust act for the $3.4 billion bid for Columbia and the $200 million offer for Guber-Peters expired Monday.
Sony has agreed to buy both companies, but is in a legal battle with Warner Communications Inc. over the services of producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters. 

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Sony also said two more suits have been filed opposing the company's agreement to buy Columbia.
Sony added that a hearing has been set for Thursday in the Delaware Chancery Court in one of the suits.
