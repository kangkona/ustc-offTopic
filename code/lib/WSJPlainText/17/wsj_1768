Canadian Pacific Ltd. said it proposed acquiring the 44% of Soo Line Corp. it doesn't already own for $19.50 a share, or about $81.9 million, after failing to find a buyer for its majority stake earlier this year. 

Soo Line said its board appointed a special committee of independent directors to study the proposal.
The troubled Minneapolis-based railroad concern said the committee has the authority to hire financial and legal advisers to assist it.
The proposed acquisition will be subject to approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission, Soo Line said. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Soo Line shares jumped well above the proposed price, closing at $20.25, up $2.75. 

Canadian Pacific put its 56% stake in Soo Line up for sale last year but couldn't find any takers.
Canadian Pacific, which has interests in transportation, telecommunications, forest products, energy and real estate, finally took its majority block off the market this spring. "It turned out we couldn't sell it," a Canadian Pacific official said, adding that acquiring the remainder of Soo Line is now "the best way to rationalize operations." 

Canadian Pacific is Soo Line's biggest customer and has owned a majority stake in the U.S. railroad since 1947.
Canadian Pacific and Soo Line tracks connect at two points in the West on the Canada-U.S. border and the two companies operate a very successful Chicago-Montreal rail service. 

Separately, for the first nine months, Soo Line reported a loss of $398,000, or four cents a share, compared with net income of $12.5 million, or $1.32 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue fell 5.8% to $407.9 million from $433.2 million.
The company had a loss from operations of $1.7 million.
