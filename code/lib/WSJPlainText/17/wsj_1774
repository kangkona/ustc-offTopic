Dun & Bradstreet Corp. posted a 15% rise in third-quarter earnings. 

But revenue declined more than 2%, reflecting in part a continuing drop in sales of credit services in the wake of controversy over the company's sales practices.
The information company also cited the stronger dollar, the sale last year of its former Official Airline Guides unit and other factors. 

Net income rose to a record $155.3 million, or 83 cents a share, from $134.8 million, or 72 cents a share.
Revenue fell to $1.04 billion from $1.07 billion. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Dun & Bradstreet closed yesterday at $53.75, down 25 cents a share. 

Analysts said the results were as expected, but several added that the earnings masked underlying weaknesses in several businesses. "The quality of earnings wasn't as high as I expected," said Eric Philo, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs & Co. 

For example, he noted, operating profit was weaker than he had anticipated, but nonoperating earnings of $14.6 million and a lower tax rate helped boost net income. 

Dun & Bradstreet said operating earnings rose 8%, excluding the sale of Official Airline Guides. 

Third-quarter sales of U.S. credit services were "disappointingly below sales" of a year earlier, Dun & Bradstreet said.
As previously reported, those sales have been declining this year in the wake of allegations that the company engaged in unfair sales practices that encouraged customers to overpurchase services.
The company has denied the allegations but has negotiated a proposed $18 million settlement of related lawsuits.
Analysts predict the sales impact will linger. "There isn't much question there will continue to be a ripple effect," said John Reidy, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 

Dun & Bradstreet noted that price competition in its Nielsen Marketing Research, Nielsen Clearing House and Donnelley Marketing businesses also restrained revenue growth.
It cited cyclical conditions in its Moody's Investors Service Inc. and D&B Plan Services units. 

For the nine months, net income rose 19% to $449 million, or $2.40 a share, from $375.9 million, or $2.01 a share, a year earlier.
Year-earlier earnings reflected costs of $14.3 million related to the acquisition of IMS International.
Revenue rose slightly to $3.16 billion from $3.13 billion.
