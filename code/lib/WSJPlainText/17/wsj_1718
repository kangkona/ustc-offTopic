The Canadian government introduced in the House of Commons legislation to extend federal regulatory authority over provincial government-owned telephone utilities in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. 

The legislation would open the way for more telephone services and more competition in the telephone business in the three provinces, federal officials said. 

The federal government initiative follows a recent Canadian Supreme Court decision that held that the major telephone companies in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba and in the Atlantic coast provinces were interprovincial undertakings and subject to federal legislative authority.
Prior to the ruling the federal government had regulated only the telephone companies in Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia and the Northwest Territories. 

The governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba have strongly opposed federal regulation of their telephone companies.
The extension of federal regulatory authority over telephone utilities in the Atlantic provinces hasn't required special legislation because they are investor-owned.
