(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

PLASTIC PENCILS, CODE-NAMED E-71, made their hush-hush debut in children's pencil boxes at five-and-dime stores in 1973.
But few knew it then and most still think all pencils are wooden. 

Eagle Pencil of Shelbyville, Tenn., "Pencil City U.S.A.," had made its earliest pilot plastic pencils in 1971.
But it wasn't until after it hired Arthur D. Little, a Cambridge, Mass., research concern, that its new product was refined for commercial sale in 1973.
Three A.D.L. inventors applied April 6, 1973, for the patent, which was assigned and awarded in 1976 to Hasbro Industries, then Eagle's parent. 

Pencil pushers chew and put the plastic models behind their ears just like traditional pencils made of glued strips of California incense cedar filled with ceramic lead.
It takes five steps to make standard pencils, just one for the plastic type.
Automated machines coextrude long plastic sheaths with graphite-plastic cores that are printed, cut, painted and eraser-fitted. 

"After more than 200 years, something new has happened to pencils," said Arthur D. Little in a 1974 report that publicly described the previously secret item.
Eagle's plastic type sharpens and looks like a wooden pencil.
A major difference is that a snapped wooden pencil will have a slivered break while a plastic model will break cleanly. 

The softness of the core constrains the plastic models to No. 1, No. 2 or No. 3-type pencils, which account for the bulk of the market.
Artists and draftsmen need harder "leads." 

Eagle, now called Eagle-Berol, remains a leading company among the 10 in the U.S. that produced about 2.3 billion pencils last year, according to the Pencil Makers Association.
It's a trade secret how many were plastic, and most writers still don't know what they're using.
