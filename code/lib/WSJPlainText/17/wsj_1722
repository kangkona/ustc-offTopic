International Business Machines Corp. and MCA Inc. said they agreed to sell their Discovision Associates joint venture to U.S. units of Pioneer Electronic Corp. for $200 million. 

The joint venture licenses a portfolio of about 1,400 patents and patent applications relating to optical-disk recording technology. 

IBM and MCA formed Discovision in 1979 to make laser-read optical products.
But the partners didn't believe the market for the systems was developing as rapidly as they had hoped.
After reportedly investing $100 million in the business, Discovision ceased manufacturing operations in 1982 and sold many of its assets to Tokyo-based Pioneer, among others. 

Discovision now has world-wide license agreements with major manufacturers covering CD audio disks, audio disk players, videodisks and videodisk players.
It also licenses optically based data storage and retrieval devices. 

James N. Fiedler, president of Discovision and a vice president of MCA, said that IBM and MCA hadn't planned to sell the joint venture, which is now profitable, but that Pioneer approached Discovision earlier this year.
He said it isn't certain whether Discovision's current management will remain when Pioneer buys the company. 

The agreement is contingent on certain government approvals and should be completed later this year.
