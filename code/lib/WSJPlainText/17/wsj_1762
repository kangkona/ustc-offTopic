USX Corp. declined a United Steelworkers request for a reopening of its four-year labor contract that is due to expire Jan. 31, 1991. 

The union on Oct. 5 requested that the contract be reopened to restore all pay and benefits that the union gave up in the 1982-83 and 1986-87 rounds of bargaining. 

A United Steelworkers spokeman said Lynn Williams, the union's president, was out of town.
The union won't respond to the USX statement until Mr. Williams has studied it, the spokesman said.
