The French building group Dumez S.A. said profit jumped 70% in the first half of 1989, partly on the strength of nonrecurring gains from a share issue by its Canadian unit. 

Dumez said group profit after payments to minority interests rose to 252 million francs ($40.1 million) from 148 million a year earlier.
Revenue rose 40% to 13.32 billion francs from 9.53 billion. 

The group noted that 75 million francs of the advance reflected a one-time gain from the June offering by its United Westburne unit in Canada.
It didn't say if its year-earlier results were influenced significantly by nonrecurring elements. 

For all of 1988, Dumez had group profit of 452 million francs after payment to minority interests.
Revenue was 21.98 billion francs. 

The group hasn't forecast full-year earnings for 1989, although it said that its first-half results aren't a good indication because of one-time elements and the seasonal nature of its operations.
