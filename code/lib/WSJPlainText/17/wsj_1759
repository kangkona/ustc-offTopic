Helmsley Enterprises Inc. plans to close its company-owned insurance business and is seeking other brokers to take over its policies, according to individuals familiar with the New York firm. 

Helmsley Enterprises is the umbrella organization for companies controlled by Harry B. Helmsley.
These include office and residential real estate giant, HelmsleySpear Inc., and Helmsley Hotels.
The insurance brokerage agency, just a fragment of Helmsley's vast empire, would be the first piece of the company to be stripped away since last summer when Mr. Helmsley's wife, Leona Helmsley, was found guilty of tax evasion. 

Industry sources estimate the agency brokers property and casualty premiums worth about $25 million annually, and has revenue, based on a standard 10% commission rate, of about $2.5 million.
The insurance firm acts as a broker on policies covering buildings managed by HelmsleySpear and others.
Many of the properties are owned through limited partnerships controlled by Mr. Helmsley. 

New York State law prohibits insurance brokerages from deriving more than 10% of revenue from insuring affiliated companies.
Helmsley's insurance division had slightly exceeded that percentage, sources say, but the division wasn't considered significant enough to the company to be restructured, particularly at a difficult time for the firm. 

Adverse publicity from the scandal surrounding its founder's wife and related management strife have put pressure on the entire Helmsley organization.
However, individuals close to the company insist shuttering the insurance division, a sideline from the company's core property management business, isn't the beginning of a sale of assets. 

Helmsley's insurance premiums are expected to be transferred to several different insurance brokerage companies.
Frank B. Hall Inc. of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. is reportedly working out an agreement with Helmsley.
Officials there declined to comment, as did Helmsley management.
