Golden Nugget Inc. reported a third-quarter net loss of $13.1 million, or 76 cents a share, based on 17.2 million common shares and dilutive equivalents outstanding.
The results compare with a year-earlier net loss of $1.5 million, or seven cents a share, based on 20.3 million common and dilutive equivalents outstanding. 

Operating revenue rose 25% to $52.1 million from $41.8 million a year ago. 

Results for the latest quarter include nonoperating items of $23.9 million, versus $8.4 million a year earlier.
Most of the expenses stem from the company's huge Mirage resort-casino scheduled to open next month along the Strip, and an April 1989 financing by units operating the downtown Golden Nugget property. 

For the nine months, Golden Nugget reported a net loss of $11.4 million, or 69 cents a share, based on 16.6 million common and dilutive equivalents outstanding.
The year earlier, the company had a net loss of $4.3 million, or 20 cents a share, based on 21 million common shares and dilutive equivalents outstanding.
The 1988 results include a $10.7 million charge stemming from a litigation judgment. 

Separately, the casino operator said its board approved a plan to buy-back as many as three million common shares from time to time, either in the open market or through private transactions.
An additional 299,000 shares are authorized for repurchase under an earlier stock buy-back program. 

John Uphoff, an analyst with Raymond James & Associates, said the results weren't surprising, and attributed the buy-back to management's confidence in the Mirage's ability to generate strong cash flow in 1990.
Yesterday, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Golden Nugget common closed at $28.25, up $2.
