Robert M. Gintel, senior partner of a Greenwich, Conn., investment firm, said he plans to launch a proxy fight against the board of Boston-based Xtra Corp. 

Mr. Gintel, head of Gintel & Co., said he plans to conduct a proxy contest to elect a majority of Xtra's board at the next annual stockholders meeting.
Xtra, a transportation leasing company, said in a statement it would have no comment on Mr. Gintel's plans until "further information has been disclosed by him." The company also said its 1990 annual meeting has not been scheduled. 

Mr. Gintel owns 300,000 of the company's 6.3 million common shares outstanding.
Xtra said it recently bought back approximately 55,000 of its shares pursuant to its existing authorization to acquire as many as 650,000 shares. 

Mr. Gintel has filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court, seeking to block Xtra's anti-takeover tactic. 

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Gintel said Xtra "has pursued business strategies that aren't in the best interest of stockholders."
