Cipher Data Products Inc. posted a net loss of $14.2 million, or 97 cents a share, for its fiscal first quarter, compared with net income of $3.8 million, or 27 cents a share, a year ago. 

Revenue for the quarter ended Sept. 30 fell 20%, to $41.3 million from $51.9 million in the year-earlier period. 

Cipher Data, a San Diego maker of magnetic tape peripherals and optical disc drives, said the loss included reserves of $3.8 million related to a corporate restructuring. 

The restructuring calls for a 24% reduction in its work force over the next two months, affecting about 525 jobs, Cipher Data said.
It is eliminating the positions of president and chief operating officer, formerly held by Edward L. Marinaro. 

Cipher Data said Mr. Marinaro consequently has resigned from those posts and from the company's board.
Mr. Marinaro couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
