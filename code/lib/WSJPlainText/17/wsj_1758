Past Due Impasse 

I never pay my bills 

Till the very last day; 

I lose far less interest 

By proceeding that way. 

But it all evens out, 

It's so easy to see: 

Not till the last moment 

Am I paid what's due me. 

-- Arnold J. Zarett. 

Rex Tremendae 

The effete Tyrannosaurus Rex 

Had strict Cretaceous views on sex, 

And that is why you only see him 

Reproduced in the museum. 

-- Laurence W. Thomas.
