The Federal National Mortgage Association said 39 lenders across the U.S. have agreed to offer home loans under Fannie Mae's pilot program for elderly people. 

Fannie Mae, a federally chartered and shareholder-owned company, said the lenders include Prudential Home Mortgage Co., a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America that operates in every state.
Prudential Insurance is based in Newark, N.J. 

Fannie Mae has agreed to buy as much as $100 million of loans under its Seniors' Housing Opportunities pilot program, which offers four types of loans to people 62 years of age or older to help them maintain their home or obtain housing.
The loans can be for accessory apartments, for cottages built in a relative's yard, for home-sharing or for sale-lease-back transactions. 

Fannie Mae makes a secondary market in home loans.
It buys loans from lenders, packages some into securities for sale to investors and holds the remainder in a portfolio.
