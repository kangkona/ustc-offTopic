PPG Industries Inc., hurt by softness in the U.S. automotive and construction industries, said third-quarter net income fell 5.5% to $106.7 million, or 97 cents a share, from $112.9 million, or $1.03 a share, a year ago. 

Sales were nearly identical to the year-earlier $1.36 billion. 

The drop in earnings didn't surprise analysts who said the Pittsburgh glass, coatings and chemical concern had been predicting a slow quarter because of the sluggish construction industry, a major market for the company's flat glass. 

Glass sales to Canadian and European auto makers and sales of replacement auto glass in all markets increased.
The coating segment also posted higher sales particularly in North America and Europe. 

But sale increases were offset by slumping sales in flat glass and fiberglass reinforcements, the company said.
Also, chemicals sales were slightly down because of lower prices for vinyl chloride monomer and other chlorine derivatives. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, PPG closed at $41 a share, down 37.5 cents.
