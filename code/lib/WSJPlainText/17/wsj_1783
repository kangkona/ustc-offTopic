Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. posted a sharp third-quarter turnaround from a year earlier, but net income would have dropped from the second quarter without a $37 million after-tax gain. 

The securities firm posted third-quarter net of $66 million, or 64 cents a share, compared with a restated year-earlier loss of $3 million, or 11 cents a share. 

Revenue climbed 25% to $3.3 billion from $2.6 billion. 

The latest period included the gain, which was $77 million before tax, from the previously announced sale of the institutional money management business of Lehman Management Co.
The 1988 period was restated from net income of $8 million to correct an overstatement in the company's Boston Co. subsidiary. 

In the 1989 second quarter, Shearson had net income of $55 million, or 54 cents a share.
An average 102.5 million common shares were outstanding in the latest quarter, up from 87.1 million. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Shearson shares lost 37.5 cents to $18.125. 

The company said the improved performance from a year ago reflects higher commissions and revenue from marketmaking and trading for its own account.
Commission revenue was $522 million, up 49%.
But industrywide trading activity slowed in September as institutional investors turned cautious and individuals continued to shy away from the market. 

Investment banking revenue fell 32% to $205 million, in part reflecting the continued slowdown of the underwriting business. 

In the nine months, net fell 3% to $106 million, or 98 cents a share, from $110 million, or $1.05 a share.
Revenue advanced 26% to $9.6 billion from $7.6 billion.
