Lonrho PLC of Britain is to come to the rescue of the French distribution group Societe Commerciale de l'Ouest Africaine in an operation that has been engineered with the Paribas financial group, Societe Commerciale's main shareholder. 

The announcement came as Societe Commerciale, a trading company with activities in more than 40 countries, reported a loss of 320.5 million francs ($51 million) for the first six months of this year, partly because of provisions on future losses. 

The rescue operation will consist of a capital boost for Societe Commerciale of one billion francs through issues of new shares and convertible bonds. 

Cie.
Financiere de Paribas said it intends to transfer its 30% shareholding in Societe Commerciale to a new company which will be jointly owned with Lonrho.
This will give Paribas and Lonrho joint control of Societe Commerciale. 

Paribas said Lonrho will participate in the forthcoming capital boost for Societe Commerciale.
