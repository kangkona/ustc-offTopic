A Canadian government agency conditionally approved proposed exports to the U.S. of natural gas from big, untapped fields in the Mackenzie River delta area of the western Canadian Arctic. 

Three companies, Esso Resources Canada Ltd., Shell Canada Ltd. and Gulf Canada Resources Ltd., applied to the Canadian National Energy Board to export 9.2 trillion cubic feet of Mackenzie delta natural gas over 20 years starting in 1996. 

To be economically feasible, the 11 billion Canadian dollar (US$9.37 billion) project requires almost a doubling of natural gas export prices.
It also faces numerous other hurdles including an agreement on a pipeline route for the gas. 

The board said the export licenses would be issued on the condition that Canadian interests would also be allowed to bid for the Mackenzie delta gas on terms similar to those offered to U.S. customers. 

U.S. buyers have already been lined up.
They include Enron Corp., Texas Eastern Corp., Pacific Interstate Transmission Co. and Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. 

The project could result in the U.S. taking more than 10% of its natural gas supplies from Canada, up from about 5% currently.
It would bring 13 gas fields into production at a combined rate of about 1.2 billion cubic feet a day. 

The board estimated that the cost of building a pipeline from the Mackenzie delta to Alberta would be about C$5.9 million.
It also said projections of surging U.S. demand for natural gas and price forecasts of C$5.25 per thousand cubic feet by 2005 would make the project economically viable. 

Esso, a unit of Imperial Oil Ltd. which is 71%-owned by Exxon Corp., will be allowed to export 5.1 trillion cubic feet to the U.S. in the 20-year period.
Shell, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, will be allowed to export 0.9 trillion cubic feet, and Gulf, a unit of Olympia & York Developments Ltd. will be allowed to export 3.2 trillion cubic feet.
