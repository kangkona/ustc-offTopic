Loral Corp. said fiscal second-quarter net income was $19.8 million, or 79 cents a share, compared with year-earlier earnings from continuing operations of $15.6 million, or 62 cents a share. 

Year-earlier net of $21 million, or 84 cents a share, included the results of Loral's former Aircraft Braking Systems and Engineered Fabrics divisions, which were sold April 27 to the company's chairman, Bernard L. Schwartz. 

The defense electronics concern attributed the operating improvement to higher profit margins and lower net interest expense. 

Loral also reported that its bookings more than doubled to $654 million in the quarter, ended Sept. 30, from $257 million, in the year-before period.
The increase was due mainly to a $325 million order from Turkey to equip its fleet of F-16 fighters with Loral's ALQ-178 Rapport III electronic countermeasures system.
The order is the biggest in the company's history. 

Sales in the latest period edged up to $295.7 million from $293.9 million. 

Mr. Schwartz said the recent increase in orders "puts us well on the way to our goal of $1.6 billion in bookings for the year." He added: "I expect to see the earnings momentum we experienced this quarter continue for the rest of the year." 

Loral said it expects sales to accelerate in both the third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year. 

Loral's profit from continuing operations for the first six months of fiscal 1990 was $36.4 million, or $1.44 a share, up 31% from $27.8 million, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier.
Net income fell 8.6% to $37.1 million, or $1.43 a share, from $40.6 million, or $1.56 a share. 

Fiscal first-half sales slipped 3.9% to $528.4 million from $549.9 million. 

Bookings for the first half totaled $813 million, compared with the $432 million recorded last year. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Loral closed at $33.25, down 37.5 cents.
