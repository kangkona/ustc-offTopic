MCA Inc. said third-quarter net fell 6.3% to $50.8 million, or 69 cents a share, from $54.3 million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier. 

MCA said revenue rose 14% to $918.4 million from $806.7 million.
The entertainment concern said the success of several movies released during the quarter, including "Parenthood" and "Uncle Buck," contributed to record revenue for its film unit.
Both MCA's music-entertainment and book-publishing units also posted record revenue and operating profit. 

The parent company's net included a loss -- which it didn't specify -- that was related to the company's 50% stake in Cineplex Odeon Corp. Cineplex, a Toronto theater chain, had a second-quarter net loss of $38.7 million. 

MCA said net also included certain reserves related to the restructuring of its LJN Toys' international operations.
These items were partly offset, MCA said, by an unspecified gain on the sale of its Miller International unit, a maker and distributor of budget-priced audio cassettes. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, MCA rose $1.50 to $64. 

In the nine months, net rose 35% to $120.1 million, or $1.64 a share, from $89.2 million, or $1.22 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue increased 22% to $2.5 billion from $2.1 billion.
