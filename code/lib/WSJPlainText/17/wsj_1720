Three savings-and-loan institutions in Kansas and Texas were added to the Resolution Trust Corp. 's conservatorship program after federal regulators declared the thrifts insolvent and named the RTC their receiver. 

The deposits, assets and certain liabilities of the three thrifts were transferred to newly chartered federal mutual institutions. 

The three institutions are: Mid Kansas Federal Savings & Loan Association, Wichita, which had $830.5 million in assets; Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association of McAllen, McAllen, Texas, with $582.6 million in assets; and Surety Savings Association, El Paso, with $309.3 million in assets. 

The three insolvent thrifts will maintain normal business hours and operations under RTC-appointed managing agents, while the RTC tries to negotiate permanent resolutions. 

Separately, Century Bank, Phoenix, Ariz., was closed by Arizona banking officials.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approved the assumption of Century's deposits and fully secured liabilities by a newly chartered subsidiary of Valley Capital Corp., Las Vegas.
The new institution is also called Century Bank, and the failed bank's five offices will reopen today. 

The failed bank had assets of about $129.6 million.
The newly chartered bank will assume about $125.7 million in 10,300 deposit accounts and pay the FDIC a purchase premium of $2.9 million.
It also will buy about $91.7 million of assets, and the FDIC will advance $31.8 million to the assuming bank.
