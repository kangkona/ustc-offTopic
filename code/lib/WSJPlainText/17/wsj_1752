Storage Technology Corp. had net income of $8.3 million, or 32 cents a share, for its fiscal-third quarter ended Sept. 29, almost 15 times the $557,000, or two cents a share, it posted for the year-ago period. 

Storage, Louisville, Colo., which makes data-storage devices for mainframe computers, said the huge increase in net reflects "strong sales" of its tape products, particularly the 4400 Automated Cartridge System, which holds a library of tape cartridges.
The company said it recently sold its 750th cartridge system, which cost $400,000 to $500,000 each. 

Quarter revenue was $232.6 million, up 12% from $206 million last year. 

The stock market reacted strongly to the news.
Storage rose $1.125 a share, to close at $14, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

For the nine months, Storage had net of $25.5 million, or 98 cents a share, including an $11.3 million extraordinary gain for the anticipated proceeds from liquidating an Irish unit.
Net was up 69% from $15.1 million, or 57 cents a share, last year. 

Revenue for the latest period was up 11% to $682.7 million, from $614.6 million.
