The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ruled unanimously that the financial troubles facing the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear-power plant have no impact on whether the plant receives a full-power license. 

Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon, opposing the license, said he will appeal the ruling in federal court.
Seabrook officials said the plant could receive a full-power license by the end of the year. 

The NRC rejected Mr. Shannon's argument that Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, which owns the largest share of Seabrook, and 11 other owners are financially unable to guarantee the plant's safe operation.
Mr. Shannon was seeking a waiver of NRC policy that ignores financial considerations in making licensing decisions. 

In its ruling, the NRC said that because Seabrook will be allowed to charge rates sufficient to run the plant and make payments on past construction costs, consideration of the owners' financial condition is pointless. 

"The commissioners found the circumstances of the case didn't undercut the assurance from government rate setters of available funds adequate for safe operation," said a commission spokesman. 

In January 1988, the utility filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, allowing it to continue to operate while protected from creditors' lawsuits.
