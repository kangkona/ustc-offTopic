W.R. Grace & Co., New York, said its earnings for the third quarter nearly doubled as a result of a $114.4 million pre-tax gain from restructuring its energy operations and other adjustments. 

Net income rose to $97.9 million, or $1.15 a share, from $50.5 million, or 60 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales increased 7% to $1.49 billion from $1.39 billion.
The gain resulted from the sale of Grace Equipment Co., the initial public offering of a one-sixth interest in Grace Energy Corp. and an adjustment in the carrying value of certain natural resource assets not part of Grace Energy. 

The international specialty chemical company's earnings were hurt by an accrual for stock-appreciation rights that reflected a 19% increase in the stock price, and higher interest expenses.
