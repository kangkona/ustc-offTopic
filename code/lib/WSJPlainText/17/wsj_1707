TransAtlantic Holdings PLC, a British-based, South African-controlled financial services investment group, and France's Societe Centrale Union des Assurances de Paris reached an accord effectively reducing chances of an unfriendly takeover for Sun Life Assurance Society PLC. 

In a joint statement, the two companies, whose combined holdings equal 52.7% of Sun Life's ordinary shares, said their agreement is aimed at reducing "the uncertainty and instability for Sun Life that has resulted from two major shareholders owning" a controlling interest in the company. 

TransAtlantic, whose Transol Investments Ltd. unit owns the largest minority stake in Sun Life, has agreed not to make a takeover bid for the British life insurer without the prior consent of the French company, known as UAP.
In return, the agreement would force UAP to buy TransAtlantic's 29.8% holding in Sun Life or sell its 22.9% stake to TransAtlantic at a price set by Transatlantic.
