China said the question of Taiwan's membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should be considered only after China's own membership in the 97-nation organization is restored. 

Both China and Taiwan are seeking seats in GATT, which sponsors trade-liberalizing agreements and sets world-commerce rules. "As one of China's provinces, Taiwan has no right to join GATT on its own," Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said. 

China, under the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek, was a founding member of GATT in 1947.
The Nationalists withdrew in 1950, after their flight to Taiwan, and the Communist government in Beijing applied for restoration of China's membership in July 1986. 

The U.S. has voiced opposition to China's bid for GATT membership, saying China has yet to undertake needed economic reforms. 

Japan's biggest women's underwear maker, Wacoal Corp., said that it developed a sports car that it plans to market in two years.
The "Jiotto Caspita" can run at over 188 miles an hour, a company spokesman said.
The base price of the car is estimated at 30 million yen (about $213,000).
Wacoal said it intends to produce the cars through a car manufacturer.
Along with the car, Wacoal plans to launch a series of Caspita-brand men's underwear. "Our image is a company that makes women's products," said a Wacoal spokesman. "Now, we're going to sell to men." 

The British satirical magazine Private Eye won an appeal against the size of a $960,000 libel award to Sonia Sutcliffe, the estranged wife of the "Yorkshire Ripper" mass murderer.
An appeals-court panel slashed all but $40,000 from the award, the largest ever set by a British jury, pending a reassessment of the damages.
But the panel dismissed the magazine's contention that it hadn't libeled Mrs. Sutcliffe when it accused her of trying to sell her story to capitalize on the notoriety of her husband.
Private Eye had been threatened with closure because it couldn't afford the libel payment. 

Senshukai Co., a travel agent based in Osaka, Japan, announced that it and Nissho Iwai Corp., a major Japanese trading house, will jointly build a 130-unit condominium in Queensland, Australia.
Senshukai said the partners plan to rent to tourists but will also sell to interested parties.
Senshukai has a 60% stake in the venture and Nissho Iwai has the rest.
Construction of the 34-floor building will begin next May and should be completed in April 1992.
Units will cost from 500,000 to 3.5 million Australian dollars (about US$386,000 to US$2.7 million). 

The Soviet Union has halted construction of two Chernobyl-type nuclear reactors and is reassessing the future of 12 other existing reactors.
Viktor Sidorenko, vice chairman of the State Committee on Nuclear Safety, said the two reactors were at Kursk and Smolensk.
News of the halt comes amid growing anger in the Ukraine and Byelorussia over continuing high levels of radiation from Chernobyl. 

A former vice president of the Singapore branch of Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. was charged in court yesterday on 19 counts of cheating.
Francis Dang, 41, is alleged to have been involved in cheating Drexel Burnham Lambert of up to 2.1 million Singapore dollars (US$1.1 million) by carrying out unauthorized transactions on the London Commodities Exchange and the International Petroleum Exchange.
Mr. Dang is alleged to have used the account of Singapore hotel and property magnate Ong Beng Seng to effect the transactions. 

Japan says its economic growth will fall sharply if it cuts back on the use of oil, coal and gas to cap emissions of carbon dioxide. 

A Ministry of International Trade and Industry official said that a study found that Japan's annual economic growth rate would eventually be only 0.8% if carbon-dioxide emissions remained at this year's level of 300 million tons.
The study will support arguments against capping carbon-dioxide emissions that Japan will make at a U.N.-backed conference on atmospheric pollution next month. 

The study said Japan's carbon-dioxide emissions would slightly more than double by 2010 unless the nation reduced its dependence on fossil fuels.
It said that expanding nuclear-power capability is the quickest way to lessen that dependence. 

But increased reliance on nuclear power would meet stiff opposition from environmentalists, a second ministry official said. 

Just in time for Halloween, Britain's Oxford University Press is publishing a "Dictionary of Superstitions." The books 1,500 entries include stepping on cracks and knocking on wood. . . . In New Zealand's tiny township of Kaitaia, which has had direct dialing for less than a year, about 30 angry phone-company customers questioned the size of their bills.
It turned out their children had been dialing a "sex fantasy" service in the U.S.
