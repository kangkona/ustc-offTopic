Doman Industries Ltd. said it increased its stake in Western Forest Products Ltd. to 56% from 22%, through a two-step transaction valued at 137 million Canadian dollars ($US116.7 million). 

Doman is based in Duncan, British Columbia.
The company, founded and controlled by Harbanse Doman, its chairman and president, said the purchase would make it Canada's 10th largest forest products company. 

Under terms of the transaction, which was proposed in June, Doman said it acquired International Forest Products Ltd. 's 22% stake in Western Forest, and Western Forest, in a related transaction, bought back a 22% interest in the company from Fletcher Challenge Canada Ltd. 

The Fletcher Challenge Canada stake was then canceled, Doman said, raising Doman's interest in Western Forest to 56%.
Doman said it was also granted an option to acquire the remaining 44% interest in Western Forest, which is currently held by two Canadian banks. 

International Forest, Western Forest, and Fletcher Challenge Canada are Vancouver-based forest products concerns.
