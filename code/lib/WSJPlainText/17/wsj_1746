First Fidelity Bancorp., Lawrenceville, N.J., reported a 24% drop in third-quarter profit, because of a decline in earning assets, lower loan volume and tighter interest margins. 

The bank holding company posted net income of $54.4 million, or 87 cents a share, including $1.7 million, or three cents a share, in one-time tax benefits.
A year earlier, net was $71.6 million, or $1.22 a share. 

First Fidelity said non-performing assets increased to $482.3 million Sept. 30 from $393.1 million June 30.
The rise resulted from the transfer to non-accrual status of $96 million "owed by two national borrowers and one local commercial real-estate customer," First Fidelity said.
It said it doesn't anticipate any loss of principal on two of the loans, comprising $85 million of these credits. 

First Fidelity said it boosted its loan-loss provision to $50.9 million from $20.4 million a year ago, primarily because of a weaker real-estate sector in the region.
