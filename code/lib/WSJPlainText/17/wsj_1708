Pride Petroleum Services Inc. said it agreed to buy well-servicing assets of two companies and expects to report higher third-quarter revenue and earnings. 

In the year-earlier quarter, the well-servicing contractor had net income of $319,000, or 3 cents a share, on revenue of about $15 million.
Results for the earlier quarter included a $100,000 restructuring charge. 

Separately, the Houston concern said it signed letters of intent for the cash and stock purchases of a total of 29 well-servicing rigs from two concerns located in New Mexico and California.
It didn't disclose specifics but said it expects to complete the purchases by Nov. 1.
