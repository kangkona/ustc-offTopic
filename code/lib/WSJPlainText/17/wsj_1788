The U.S. Export-Import Bank tentatively decided to guarantee commercial bank financing for the purchase of two Boeing Co. 767 airliners by Avianca, Colombia's international airline, at a cost of about $150 million. 

The loan guarantee would amount to about $127.5 million, or 85% of the cost of the aircraft. 

Because of the size of the proposed loan guarantee, the Ex-Im Bank's preliminary commitment is subject to review by the House and Senate Banking committees.
Ex-Im Bank officials said this review process currently is under way.
