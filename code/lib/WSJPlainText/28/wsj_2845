The National Association of Securities Dealers said it fined a former securities dealer in North Providence, R.I., $700,000 for alleged violations of its rules and of federal securities laws. 

The association, a self-regulating organization for the over-the-counter securities market, said it also barred the dealer, Edward Eugene Dockray, from associating with NASD members.
The NASD added that its sanctions against Mr. Dockray were imposed as part of a settlement in which he neither admitted nor denied charges against him. 

Mr. Dockray couldn't be reached for comment. 

The NASD said its charges against Mr. Dockray included an allegation that he misused proceeds from the sale of a security titled Electronic Whiteboard Leasing Program.
About $1.4 million of the security were sold to 140 investors in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut and other states between May 1987 and April 1988, the NASD said.
Mr. Dockray also misrepresented the rate of return on the security and other material facts about it, the NASD charged.
