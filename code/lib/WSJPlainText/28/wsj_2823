MIPS Computer Systems Inc. won two giant European customers for its computers, boosting its push to establish its chip as an industry standard. 

MIPS agreed to supply its computers to Nixdorf Computer AG of West Germany and to Groupe Bull of France.
The European electronics companies will sell under their own nameplates machines that use MIPS's reduced-instruction-set-computer technology. 

In addition, MIPS will allow Nixdorf to manufacture certain MIPS computer products on its own.
The Nixdorf deal will create $35 million in revenue for MIPS over a five-year contract, MIPS said, while the Bull pact will generate $50 million in revenue over three years. 

The unrelated deals are a boon to the effort by closely held MIPS to win converts to its RISC computer architecture at the expense of such RISC competitors as Sun Microsystems Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Motorola Inc.
The computer makers have been jockeying to woo the world's computer makers to their own standards.
Sun recently agreed to let N.V. Philips of the Netherlands design and sell its Sparc chip; Hewlett-Packard has signed up Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea and Hitachi Ltd. of Japan to develop RISC chips; Motorola is linked with Thomson-CSF of France. 

MIPS earlier this year agreed to let Siemens of West Germany make its RISC chip.
Nixdorf and Bull "will play a key role in expanding the market share for MIPS-based computing systems," said Robert C. Miller, MIPS's chairman and chief executive officer.
