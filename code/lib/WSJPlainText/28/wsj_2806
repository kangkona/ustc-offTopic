I read David Asman's Sept. 25 editorial-page article, "Man in the Middle of Drug Trafficking," concerning Reinaldo Ruiz, and my attention was drawn to the mention of the Jose Alvero-Cruz case.
Mr. Asman's facts concerning that case are inaccurate. 

From 1978 to 1980 I was the chief of the Fraud and Public Corruption Section of the U.S. Attorney's Office here in Miami.
From 1980 to 1981 I was that office's senior litigation counsel.
I prosecuted the case against Mr. Alvero-Cruz, and indeed traveled to Spain to obtain documents and witnesses necessary for that prosecution.
That indictment charged him solely with tax evasion and he was convicted of all four counts that he was charged with. 

At the trial, however, contrary to the article, drugs were not mentioned nor were Mr. Alvero-Cruz's relations, if any, with Cuban officials raised.
There was no proof or allegations of marijuana importation or other involvement with Cuban officials.
While I personally believed that Mr. Alvero-Cruz's income derived from the marijuana trade, there was no need to offer such proof at his tax-evasion trial.
Additionally, Mr. Alvero-Cruz's American passport validated by U.S. officials in Cuba was not an issue in the case.
