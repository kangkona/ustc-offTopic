Andrew Nagorski, longtime correspondent in the East bloc, writing in the Oct. 2 issue of Newsweek: 

The East German exodus brought home the fact that years of West German economic support -- massive payments for transit, postal and other "fees" along with bargain-basement financial deals -- have not produced a kinder, gentler East Germany.
Erich Honecker's regime has allowed a dramatic increase in legal emigration and family visits to West Germany.
But in effect, Bonn's generosity has allowed Honecker to resist reforms, claiming ideological purity while milking the West Germans at every opportunity.
