Donohue Inc. "won't contradict" an estimate for 1989 net income of C$1.60 a share (US$1.36), said Paul Premont, president and chief operating officer of the pulp and newsprint producer. 

"It could be a little bit higher or a little lower but C$1.60 isn't a bad (estimate)," Mr. Premont said in an interview in Quebec City. 

That would represent a sharp decline from 1988 record earnings of C$2.21 a share, or C$68.7 million, on sales of C$648.3 million.
For the first six months of 1989, Donohue had net income of 79 Canadian cents a share, or C$25.4 million, down about 24% from a year earlier.
Sales in the first half were up about 5% to C$334 million. 

Donohue is 54.2%-owned by a joint venture of Quebecor Inc. and Maxwell Communication Corp., of which Quebecor owns 51% and Maxwell 49%.
Quebecor is a Montreal publishing and printing concern.
Maxwell is a London publishing concern.
