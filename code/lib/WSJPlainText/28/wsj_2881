Boston Bancorp said it expects to recognize a $6 million to $8 million pretax gain on the sale of 20% to 25% of its stock in Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 

The gain will be reflected in results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending Oct. 31, the bank holding company said. 

The company had fourth-quarter net income of $4.4 million, or 57 cents a share, a year ago.
