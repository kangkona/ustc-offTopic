The Federal National Mortgage Association said third-quarter earnings jumped more than 60% to $211.9 million, or 80 cents a share, from $132.4 million, or 55 cents a share, the year before. 

The per-share numbers reflect the 3-for-1 common stock split announced last month.
The earnings -- Fannie Mae's seventh consecutive quarter of record profit -- reflected a continued increase in the spread between Fannie Mae's yield on its investment portfolio and the cost of debt, a bigger investment portfolio and steady growth in guaranty fees. 

David O. Maxwell, chairman and chief executive officer, said the latest quarter "demonstrates anew the strength of Fannie Mae as a long-term investment." 

During the quarter, foreclosures and related losses dropped, and Washington-based Fannie Mae cut its provision for losses to $75 million from $80 million in the second quarter.
Net interest income -- income from Fannie Mae's investment portfolio minus interest paid on borrowings and other related costs -- rose to $301.5 million from $217.2 million the year before.
