Advanced Micro Devices reported a 68% jump in third-quarter net income, mainly on the strength of continued strong demand for microchips used in personal computers, as well as large Asian orders. 

The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based microchip maker said it earned $12.1 million, or 12 cents a share, for the period, on revenue of $274.9 million.
In the year-ago quarter, Advanced Micro earned $7.2 million, or six cents a share, on slightly higher revenue of $285.5 million.
The most recent results were about the same as the sales and profit reported in the second quarter. 

For the nine months, Advanced Micro reported net income of $34.2 million, or 32 cents a share, on sales of $819.4 million, compared with $53.4 million, or 56 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
