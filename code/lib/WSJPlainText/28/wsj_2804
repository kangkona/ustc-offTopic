Frank Mankiewicz's insistence that public relations is not a profession (Notable & Quotable, Sept. 15) is a breath of fresh air in a smoky field. 

Public relations is an honorable trade if plied with integrity and imagination.
It also helps to understand the role of the press, to know the business or other activity you are representing and to be able to write a declarative sentence.
Loftier ambitions may be pursued after-hours or in another line of work.
