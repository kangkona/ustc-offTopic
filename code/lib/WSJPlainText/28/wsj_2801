AirTran Corp. said revenue passenger miles for its Mesaba Aviation unit more than doubled in September from a year ago. 

Revenue passenger miles rose to 15.1 million from 7.3 million.
A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger carried one mile. 

The load factor, or percentage of seats filled, in September rose to 51.7%, from 48.9% a year ago. 

The increases were a result in part of the airline's new hub service at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, the company said.
