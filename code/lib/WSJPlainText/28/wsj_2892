Bell Atlantic Corp. 's Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co. unit filed a protest with the federal government over an eight-year, $90 million contract awarded to American Telephone & Telegraph Co. 

The protest, filed with the General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals, said that AT&T's price for the digital communications switching system for the Treasury Department's Washington offices was $18 million above C&P's offer. 

The contract has a long history.
AT&T was originally awarded the job in November 1987, but the Treasury Department withdrew the award after another C&P protest.
In its latest action, C&P alleged that the Treasury didn't consider all bidders equally. 

A spokeswoman for AT&T said the company was "disappointed and frustrated" by the latest delay in a four-year effort to upgrade telecommunication services at the Treasury.
