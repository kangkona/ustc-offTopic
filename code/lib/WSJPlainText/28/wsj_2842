A federal court jury awarded retailing executive David Dworkin $790,000 and determined he was wrongfully dismissed as president of the Neiman Marcus department store chain. 

The jury verdict against Neiman Marcus Group Inc., which was reached last week, arose from litigation connected with the restructuring of Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. two years ago.
In the restructuring, Carter Hawley spun off Neiman Marcus Group, and General Cinema Corp. traded its stake in Carter Hawley for a 60% interest in Neiman Marcus. 

At issue was whether Mr. Dworkin resigned his post in late 1987 or was dismissed.
Mr. Dworkin, currently president of the Bonwit Teller department store chain, maintained he was assured by General Cinema representatives that his job was secure, but that he was then dismissed. 

In April 1988, Neiman Marcus filed suit in state court in Dallas seeking a legal ruling to the effect that Mr. Dworkin had resigned his job.
Mr. Dworkin responded in June by filing suit in federal court in Los Angeles in which he claimed wrongful dismissal.
The two suits were consolidated in federal court in Dallas. 

"I'm glad it's over," said Mr. Dworkin. "I felt wronged, and I wanted to right the record." Peter Farwell, vice president, corporate relations for Neiman Marcus Group, said, "We are disappointed and we don't agree with the jury finding.
I'm not sure what our next step will be." 

General Cinema never produced a letter of resignation signed by Mr. Dworkin.
Since Mr. Dworkin had a signed employment contract, jurors apparently were unwilling to believe General Cinema's argument that he had quit his job without seeking any settlement.
Further, Mr. Dworkin didn't have a new job to go to immediately after leaving Neiman Marcus.
He started his present job with Bonwit Teller on March 1, 1988.
