Varity Corp. said in Toronto that it no longer plans to hold a shareholders' meeting to approve its pending acquisition of auto parts maker K-H Corp. 

A spokesman for Varity, a maker of farm equipment and auto parts, said the number of new Varity shares to be issued to K-H shareholders under amended terms of the transaction is less than 20% of Varity's common and preferred shares outstanding.
The spokesman said that that makes approval by Varity shareholders unnecessary under Toronto Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange regulations. 

Varity said Detroit-based K-H will proceed with its plan to hold a shareholders meeting Nov. 29.
The acquisition also requires the approval of K-H debenture and note holders.
