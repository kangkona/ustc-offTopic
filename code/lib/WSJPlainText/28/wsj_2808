In Bob Davis's Aug. 25 page-one summary of the Voyager mission, he describes a telephone interview with me before Voyager 2 encountered Neptune, in which I predicted that the surface of Neptune's moon Triton would be rich in complex organic solids.
Bishun Khare and I named such solids tholins 10 years ago.
But Mr. Davis is wrong to call these materials "primordial." These organic solids would be produced from the methane snows of contemporary Triton by charged particles and ultraviolet radiation. 

After the encounter, Mr. Davis writes, "Instead of vast fields of 'tholin, ' there are small patches of reddish material. . . ." There's no "instead" about it.
Tens of percent of the surface area of Triton -- or more than a million square miles -- are spectrally red.
As far as I can tell, all scientists working on the problem -- including all my fellow members of the Voyager Imaging Team -- concur that organics are the cause.
This completes an important set of findings by Voyager in which complex organic matter, perhaps similar to the material that led to the origin of life on Earth, has been found abundantly through the outer solar system. 

(If the report of spectrally blue snow holds up in the face of further data analysis, there may not be any deep mystery here.
Very fine grained methane frost, before being irradiated, often shows such a color.)
