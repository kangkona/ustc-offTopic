In one of the largest insider-trading cases ever, a 439-count indictment against Taiwanese investor and fugitive Fred C. Lee has been unsealed.
Mr. Lee settled civil charges earlier this year. 

U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said the indictment, which was filed on Oct. 14, 1988, was unsealed in the hope that public awareness about the case and the charges against Mr. Lee would make it easier to locate him. "It appeared that keeping it sealed wasn't helping in apprehending Lee," said Assistant U.S. Attorney John M. McEnany.
He said a warrant for Mr. Lee's arrest was issued last year. 

The indictment includes one count of conspiracy and numerous counts of mail, wire and securities fraud. 

Mr. Lee, an international businessman with substantial interests in real estate, importing and exporting, and public utilities, is believed to be living in Taiwan.
But the U.S. government cannot extradite a Taiwanese national for the offenses Mr. Lee allegedly committed. 

In the indictment, the government alleges that from about June 1987 to July 1988, Mr. Lee engaged in an insider-trading scheme with Stephen S. Wang, a former junior analyst at Morgan, Stanley & Co.
The government alleged that using the insider information, Mr. Lee illicitly gained more than $16.5 million in profits by trading in stocks and options of at least 16 companies.
Mr. Lee then transferred about $200,000 to Mr. Wang and promised to pay him more. 

Earlier this year, Mr. Lee, through attorneys appearing on his behalf, agreed to pay $25.2 million in penalties and profit disgorgement as part of a settlement of civil insider-trading charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the alleged scam. 

Mr. Wang also settled with the SEC, agreeing to forfeit all funds he received from Mr. Lee, among other things.
Last year Mr. Wang pleaded guilty to the government's charges of three counts of securities fraud in connection with the alleged scheme.
