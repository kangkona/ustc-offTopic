Interferon Sciences Inc. said the Food and Drug Administration approved its Alferon N Injection treatment for genital warts. 

The company, which is 77%-owned by National Patent Development Corp., New York, said the treatment is the first human-leukocyte-derived alpha interferon product approved for sale in the U.S.
The company said there are about eight million new and recurrent cases in the U.S. 

Schering-Plough Corp., Madison, N.J., has received FDA approval for an alpha interferon product for genital warts, but the treatment is derived from tissues other than white blood cells.
