Vernitron Corp. filed suit charging Kollmorgen Corp. with violating securities law in connection with their plan to merge. 

Last month, Vernitron, a closely held industrial electronics company in Deer Park, N.Y., withdrew from a plan to acquire the Simsbury, Conn., maker of electronic, industrial and defense products for $320 million.
At the time, Vernitron cited "adverse changes" in Kollmorgen but a spokeswoman wouldn't elaborate. 

In the latest salvo in their 10-month battle, Vernitron filed suit in U.S. District Court in Hartford, Conn.
Kollmorgen recently obtained an order from a Connecticut Superior Court judge temporarily blocking Vernitron from pursuing any further proposals to acquire Kollmorgen. 

Vernitron's suit seeks to void the merger agreement.
It also asks for actual damages of at least $16.8 million and punitive damages of $35 million.
Kollmorgen officials were unavailable for comment. 

The suit charges that Kollmorgen withheld an updated economic forecast showing lower expected profit figures than Kollmorgen had provided to Vernitron earlier.
Vernitron said that if it had had the updated numbers, it wouldn't have agreed to pay $25 a share for Kollmorgen.
