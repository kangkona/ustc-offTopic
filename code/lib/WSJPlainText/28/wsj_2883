Bear, Stearns & Co. formed a group to buy the Israeli government's 82% stake in Jerusalem Economic Corp. for $1.70 a share, or $53 million. 

The group plans an offer to buy the rest of Jerusalem Economic's shares, which trade on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, at about the same price. 

This summer, Israeli Finance Minister Shimon Peres announced the sale of the stake as part of the government's push to privatize many businesses. 

Jerusalem Economic, formed by the government and other entities in 1948 to develop industrial buildings in Jerusalem, owns 2.3 million square feet of office and warehouse space around the city.
Jerusalem Economic also has about 360,000 square feet under construction. 

The group includes the securities firm; Uzi Zucker and Carl Glickman, directors of parent Bear Stearns Cos.; and Eliezer Fishman, a Tel Aviv accountant, real-estate investor and publisher.
