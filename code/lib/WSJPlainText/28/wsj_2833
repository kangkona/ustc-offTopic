The unemployment rate in the 12-nation European Community was at 9.2% in August, unchanged from the previous month, according to the EC's statistical agency Eurostat. 

For the 12 months to August, the rate fell to 9.2% from 10.1%.
The EC's jobless rate is adjusted for seasonal factors. 

Eurostat didn't give a figure for the total number of unemployed in August because the Netherlands hadn't sent jobless data.
In July, the figure was 14.2 million people unemployed. 

Eurostat said the latest figure confirmed EC unemployment has remained stable in recent months.
