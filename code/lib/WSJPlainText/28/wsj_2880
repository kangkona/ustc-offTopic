Domtar Inc. said it will cut about 8% of its white-collar staff, or 500 employees, by the end of the year in a "major organizational restructuring." The concern cited soft markets for construction materials, packaging and paper products as well as its decision to sell its chemicals products business. 

Domtar said it will take a special charge against earnings in the current fourth quarter or in the first quarter of 1990 related to the restructuring.
The company said the size of the charge hasn't yet been determined and won't be known for several weeks. 

Domtar said the majority of the positions cut will be at Montreal headquarters and will be at all levels of the company up to and including vice president.
Domtar has 16,000 employees in the U.S. and Canada, of which 6,000 are white-collar employees. 

Domtar's earnings in the first half dropped about 19% to 52 Canadian cents (44 U.S. cents), or C$51 million, and analysts are predicting an even weaker second half.
