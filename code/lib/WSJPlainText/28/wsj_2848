The huge demonstration that advocates of the so-called homeless issue staged in Washington last weekend is having an unintended effect: The D.C. City Council, supported by the city's mayor, is drafting legislation to overturn its liberal shelter law for the homeless.
The morning after the march, the Washington Post reported that in the past five years, Washington's homeless population has increased fivefold and the program's costs have tripled to $32 million annually.
Says Council member Nadine Winter, who herself has operated a homeless shelter: "I think we need to send a message that this is not a bottomless pit in Washington." Ms. Winter believes many of the people using the shelters have jobs and should have to repay the District for its services.
John Ray, another Council member and a mayoral candidate, says the law is attracting homeless people to Washington from around the country: "We've got to set some standards and some regulations to get better control of this." Passage is likely because of support from 55 District community organizations, including neighborhood groups.
Homeless advocates are opposing the rollback.
