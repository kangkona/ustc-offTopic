Nine major companies that use chlorofluorocarbons have agreed to work with the Environmental Protection Agency to find alternatives to the ozone-destroying chemical. 

Under the accord, the companies will encourage the prompt adoption of alternatives, share information with industry around the world, and work with their overseas suppliers to encourage the adoption of ozone-safe technology by small companies in developing countries. 

CFCs are man-made chemicals used mainly in air conditioning and refrigeration.
Use of the chemicals is destroying the ozone layer, which blocks harmful ultraviolet radiation from reaching the earth.
Ultraviolet radiation causes skin cancer and cataracts and suppresses the human immune system, among other effects. 

The companies and the EPA announced the accord at a conference here.
The companies are American Telephone & Telegraph Co., Boeing Co., Digital Equipment Corp., Ford Motor Co., General Electric Co., Honeywell Inc., Motorola Inc., Northern Telecom Ltd. and Texas Instruments Inc. 

In a statement, Deputy EPA Administrator Henry Habicht commended the manufacturers for "forming a new co-operative that will speed up the development of new technologies and help transfer their application world-wide."
