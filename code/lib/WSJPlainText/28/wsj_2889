American Maize-Products Co., Stamford, Conn., said it will consolidate certain operations of two cigar-making plants in Florida, in a move to reduce overhead at its Jno.
H. Swisher & Son Inc. unit. 

About 300 workers will lose their jobs between the Clearwater plant, which was bought as part of a 1986 acquisition and will be closed, and the Jacksonville plant, which will lose its packaging operations.
The moves will take effect by June 30, 1990.
Operations will be shifted to its existing Waycross, Ga., cigar plant. 

Nationally, unit sales of cigars have been on the decline for the past few years, but Swisher maintains its market share has increased. 

American Maize primarily has interests in making corn syrups and starches.
