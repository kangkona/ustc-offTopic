Computer executives have been selling a lot of stock in their own companies this year. 

Hardware and software concerns are the companies whose shares have been most actively sold by their own executives, directors and other corporate insiders, according to Robert Gabele, president of Invest/Net.
The North Miami, Fla., company keeps track of the reports insiders are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission when they buy or sell stock in their own firms. 

Two of the five most-sold companies on this week's Insider Trading Spotlight are computer companies. 

Many investors watch these reports for investment clues.
The theory is, basically, that no one is in a better position than a corporate insider to judge a company's strengths and weaknesses -- and, thus, the future of its stock price.
Information about insider transactions is supposed to be especially useful for outside investors when purchases or sales by several insiders are clustered within a short period of time. 

But at three of the four computer companies where two or more officials have sold recently, following the insiders' example would have cost investors money.
Share prices of those firms have risen since the insiders sold. 

Consider Informix Corp., a Menlo Park, Calif., marketer of data-base management software.
Four Informix insiders, including Chairman Roger Sippl, sold a total of 100,000 shares in August at $8.25 to $9 a share.
Mr. Sippl sold 50,000 shares in three separate sales for a total of $408,750. 

But the stock closed yesterday in over-the-counter trading at $11.625, down 37.5 cents.
If the company executives had waited to sell, their shares would have brought substantially more -- in Mr. Sippl's case, $172,500 more. 

The four executives sold to diversify their holdings and "are no reflection on their long-term or short-term prospects for the company," said David Stanley, corporate counsel. "These are young people, in their early 30s, who were founders of the company and have the vast majority, if not all, of their net worth in company stock," he said. 

Mr. Sippl, who could not be reached for comment, has 450,535 shares remaining, Mr. Stanley said.
All told, counting sales earlier this year, Mr. Sippl has sold 27% of his stake in Informix.
The other three officers sold 15,000 to 20,000 shares each.
Each still has over 400,000 shares remaining, Mr. Stanley confirmed. 

At Microcom Inc., the chairman and president has been so unlucky in timing his stock sales that it has become a bit of a joke within the company, said Jake Fennessy, the company's director of treasury operations. 

James Dow, chairman and president of the manufacturer of data communications equipment, sold 15,000 shares Aug. 8 and 11.
He received $279,375 for his stock, most of which was sold for $18.50 a share.
But in national over-the-counter trading, Microcom closed yesterday at $21.50, down 75 cents. 

"It's kind of curious, Jim has a habit of selling at the bottom of a cycle," said Mr. Fennessy. "The last three major sales have come before an upswing." Mr. Dow's sale represented 5% of his holdings in the company.
Mr. Dow was in Europe and could not be reached for comment. 

Four other insiders at the Norwood, Mass., company also sold stock in July and August, for between $16.50 and $19.75 a share.
They sold between 500 and 12,800 shares, representing between 6% and 100% of their stakes in the company. 

At Baltimore-based Sage Software, two insiders sold stock in late August. 

Richard A. Lefebvre, a director, sold 21,250 shares Aug. 30, He still has 1,998 shares.
A day later, Russell Planitzer, the company's chairman, sold the 800 shares he held indirectly.
He still holds 24,056 shares directly, according to SEC records. 

Both men received $7.75 a share.
In national over-the-counter trading, Sage Software rose 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $8.875 a share. 

Neither of the Sage insiders could be reached for comment.
Melody Saunders, the company's chief financial officer, said the sales came virtually at the same time, because both men had waited until the release of first-quarter earnings Aug. 18 to sell their shares.
Sage said first-quarter earnings dropped to one cent a share from two cents a year earlier. 

The picture at Chips & Technologies Inc., a San Jose, Calif., semiconductor company, is more complicated.
Some of the seven insiders who sold recently showed good timing, while others would have benefited by holding off. 

The insiders sold in August at prices ranging from $22.75 to $25.75 a share.
The stock closed yesterday at $24.25, unchanged, in national over-the-counter trading. 

The seven sold a total of 463,541 shares the month before the company cut first-quarter earnings estimates on Sept. 7. "It's not that we see business in the tank, and guys are getting out," said Gary Martin, vice president and head of finance. "As an insider group, we sell about every quarter, to get {shares} out there on the market and diversify out." 

Mr. Martin said he sold 20,000 shares in August because he is building a home. 

Other company executives couldn't be reached for comment.
SEC filings show that James Stafford, a vice president, sold 125,000 shares, or 98% of his holdings in the company, in three sales in August.
Gordon Campbell, the company's president, sold 145,000 shares, or 7% of his stake.
The other four insiders sold between 5,000 and 88,451 shares, according to the filings.
