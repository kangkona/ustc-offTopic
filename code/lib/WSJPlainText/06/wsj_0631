Finnair, Finland's state-owned airline, joined the wave of global airline alliances and signed a wide-ranging cooperation agreement with archrival Scandinavian Airlines System. 

Under the accord, Finnair agreed to coordinate flights, marketing and other functions with SAS, the 50%-state-owned airline of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
The pact also calls for coordination between Finnair and Switzerland's national carrier, Swissair, with which SAS entered a similar alliance last month. 

Finnair and SAS said they plan to swap stakes in each other.
Neither disclosed details pending board meetings next month.
Officials hinted, however, that SAS would take a stake of at least 6% in Finnair, valued at about $40 million at current market prices.
Finnair would receive SAS shares valued at the same amount, officials said.
