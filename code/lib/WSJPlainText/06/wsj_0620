Exxon Corp. is resigning from the National Wildlife Federation's corporate advisory panel, saying the conservation group has been unfairly critical of the Exxon Valdez oil spill along the Alaskan coast. 

The federation said Friday that it regrets the resignation, but issued a stinging response that called Exxon a "corporate pariah" that should keep an open dialogue with environmentalists. 

The federation, with 5.8 million members nationwide, has been one of the sharpest critics of Exxon's handling of the 11 million gallon tanker spill and has accused the company of repeatedly ignoring requests to meet and discuss it. 

The March 24 oil spill soiled hundreds of miles of shoreline along Alaska's southern coast and wreaked havoc with wildlife and the fishing industry. 

Exxon's Exxon USA unit was one of the charter members of the Corporate Conservation Council, a panel of executives formed in 1982 by the National Wildlife Federation to foster "frank and open discussions" between industry and the federation's leaders. 

In a letter to the federation, Raymond Campion, Exxon's environmental coordinator, said: "Recent public actions by you regarding the Valdez oil spill have failed to demonstrate any sense of objectivity or fairness." 

The federation was among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in August against Exxon seeking full payment of environmental recovery costs from the spill.
