Lockheed Corp. said it will trim its Aeronautical Systems work force in California and Georgia by several hundred workers, reflecting the defense industry's decline. 

The Lockheed unit has 24,000 workers; it expects to make the cuts through a combination of furloughs, attrition and retirements.
The reductions should be complete by the end of the year, a spokesman said, adding that the exact number to be cut hasn't been determined. 

Lockheed reported a $32 million third-quarter net loss, largely because of cost overruns on fixed-price military contracts. 

Noting that other defense contractors are complaining of losses on such contracts, analysts say taxpayers have been getting illusionary bargains on weapons systems in recent years. 

Defense contractors "cannot continue to get contracts on that basis," said Howard Rubel, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. in New York. "The pain is too great."
