ABB Asea Brown Boveri B.V. said it signed a contract for the largest-ever power plant order in the Netherlands. 

ABB said the contract, signed with the Dutch utility N.V. Energieproduktiebedrijf UNA, is valued in excess of $200 million.
The accord is for a turbogenerator plant at the coal-fired power station Hemweg in Amsterdam.
ABB Asea Brown Boveri is the Dutch unit of the Swedish-Swiss electrical engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG. 

ABB said a significant portion of the order will be placed with Dutch subcontractors, adding that a group has been set up for this purpose. 

The Dutch utility firm serves the Amsterdam and Utrecht areas.
The planned turbogenerator plant is expected to go into operation in 1994.
