The Treasury Department said the U.S. trade deficit may worsen next year, after two years of significant improvement. 

In its report to Congress on international economic policies, the Treasury said that any improvement in the broadest measure of trade, known as the current account, "is likely at best to be very modest," and "the possibility of deterioration in the current account next year cannot be excluded." 

The statement was the U.S. government's first acknowledgement of what other groups, such as the International Monetary Fund, have been predicting for months.
Continued strength in the dollar was cited as one reason the trade position may deteriorate. 

The Treasury's report, which is required annually by a provision of the 1988 trade act, again took South Korea to task for its exchange-rate policies. "We believe that there have continued to be indications of exchange-rate `manipulation'" during the past six months, it said, citing the lack of market forces in South Korea's exchange-rate system and the use of capital and interest-rate controls to manipulate exchange rates. 

The Treasury expressed pleasure, however, with the government of Taiwan, which was cited for exchange-rate manipulation in last year's report.
The Treasury said Taiwan has liberalized its exchange rate system in the past year.
