Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said it applied to Taiwanese securities officials for permission to open brokerage offices in Taipei. 

Shearson's application is the first since the Taiwan Securities and Exchange Commission announced June 21 that it would allow foreign brokerage firms to do business in that country.
Taiwan officials are expected to review the Shearson application later this year. 

Under current rules, investors in Taiwan can buy overseas stocks only through the purchase of mutual funds issued by local and foreign investment trusts.
The new rules will allow investors to buy foreign stocks directly. 

A spokesman for Shearson said the brokerage service will be directed at individual investors who want to buy foreign and domestic stocks. "It's an attractive market with good growth opportunities," he added.
