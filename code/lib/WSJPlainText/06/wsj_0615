Italy's trade deficit narrowed to 2.007 trillion lire ($1.49 billion) in September from 2.616 trillion lire a year earlier, the state statistical office Istat said. 

The deficit was 466 billion lire in August.
For the first nine months, the trade deficit was 14.933 trillion lire, compared with 10.485 trillion lire in the year-earlier period.
Istat said the statistics are provisional and aren't seasonally adjusted. 

Imports rose 11% to 18.443 trillion lire in September from a year earlier, while exports rose 17% to 16.436 trillion lire.
In the nine months, imports rose 20% to 155.039 trillion lire, while exports grew 18% to 140.106 trillion lire.
Import values are calculated on a cost, insurance and freight (c.i.f.) basis, while exports are accounted for on a free-on-board (f.o.b.) basis.
