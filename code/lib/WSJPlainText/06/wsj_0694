We are deeply disturbed that a recent editorial stated that the "Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989" was "crafted primarily by Democratic Senators Kennedy and Harkin" with a premise "based on the presumption that most Americans are hostile to the disabled. . . ." Perhaps even more offensive is the statement, "It is surprising that George Bush and the White House inner circle would ally themselves with this crabby philosophy." 

This legislation was not drafted by a handful of Democratic "do-gooders." Quite the contrary -- it results from years of work by members of the National Council on the Handicapped, all appointed by President Reagan.
You depict the bill as something Democratic leaders "hoodwinked" the administration into endorsing.
The opposite is true: It's the product of many meetings with administration officials, Senate staffers, advocates, and business and transportation officials.
Many congressmen are citing the compromise on the "Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989" as a model for bipartisan deliberations. 

Most National Council members are themselves disabled or are parents of children with disabilities.
We know firsthand the discrimination addressed by the act: to be told there's no place for your child in school; to spend lonely hours at home because there is no transportation for someone in a wheelchair; to be denied employment because you are disabled. 

Your editorial mockingly entitles this legislation the "Lawyers' Employment Act." For the 43 million people with disabilities and their families, this legislation is the "Emancipation Proclamation."
