Ciba-Geigy AG, the big Swiss chemicals company, said that it agreed in a letter of intent with Corning Inc. to acquire Corning's 50% share of Ciba Corning Diagnostics Corp., based in Medfield, Mass. 

Ciba Corning, which had been a 50-50 venture between Basel-based Ciba-Geigy and Corning, has annual sales of about $300 million, the announcement said.
Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed.
Ciba Corning makes clinical diagnostics systems and related products for the medical-care industry. 

The announcement said the acquisition should be completed by December after a definitive agreement is completed and regulatory approval is received. 

Ciba-Geigy intends to develop the Ciba Corning unit into a "substantial business," making the unit an "integral part" of Ciba-Geigy's "comprehensive disease management concept."
