Merger and acquisition activity in the third quarter exceeded the year-earlier pace, said Merrill Lynch & Co. 's W.T. Grimm & Co. unit in Schaumburg, Ill. 

A total of 672 transactions were announced during the latest quarter, up 13% from the year-earlier period's 597, Grimm said.
Transactions in which prices were disclosed totaled $71.9 billion, up 36% from $52.9 billion a year earlier, the company added. 

Grimm counted 16 transactions valued at $1 billion or more in the latest period, twice as many as a year earlier.
The largest was the $12 billion merger creating Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. 

In the first nine months, 1,977 transactions were announced, up 15% from 1,716 in the year-earlier period.
