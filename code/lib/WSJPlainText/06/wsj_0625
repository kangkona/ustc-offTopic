The Treasury said it plans to sell $2 billion of 51-day cash-management bills today, raising all new cash. 

The bills will be dated Oct. 31 and will mature Dec. 21, 

No non-competitive tenders will be accepted.
Tenders, available in minimum denominations of $1 million, must be received by noon EST today at Federal Reserve Banks or branches. 

The Treasury also announced details of this week's unusual bill auction, which has been changed to accommodate the expiration of the federal debt ceiling at midnight tomorrow. 

The 13-week and 27-week bills will be issued tomorrow rather than Thursday, Nov. 2, as originally planned.
The three-month bills will still mature Feb. 1, 1990, and the six-month bills on May 3, 1990. 

The Treasury also said noncompetitive tenders will be considered timely if postmarked no later than Sunday, Oct. 29, and received no later than tomorrow. 

The Treasury said it won't be able to honor reinvestment requests from holders of bills maturing Nov. 2 held in the Treasury's book-entry system.
The department will make payment for bills maturing on Nov. 2 to all investors who have requested reinvestment of their bills on that date, as well as to all account holders who have previously requested payment.
