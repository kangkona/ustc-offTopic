Presidio Oil Co. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. 's U.S. unit for $163 million. 

Presidio, a Denver oil and gas concern, said it will acquire the properties and operations of Home Petroleum Corp., which includes two regional gas-gathering systems and proved reserves of about nine million barrels of oil and 72 billion cubic feet of natural gas. 

Presidio said the properties are generally situated in Wyoming, North Dakota, Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. 

Gulf Canada, Calgary, said the transaction is part of its plan to sell non-strategic assets and focus operations on Canada, Indonesia and other international areas. 

A spokesman for Gulf Canada, which is controlled by Toronto's Reichmann family, said the properties account for about 6% of the company's assets and produce about 5,000 barrels of oil and 35 million cubic feet of gas a day.
He said Gulf Canada will likely report an extraordinary gain from the sale in the fourth quarter, but he wouldn't offer a specific estimate. 

The transaction is expected to close by Nov. 30.
