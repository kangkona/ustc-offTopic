Employees of the Globe and Mail, a Thomson Corp. newspaper in Toronto, voted to accept a tentative contract agreement Saturday, averting a strike at Canada's leading daily. 

Under the terms of the three-year contract, similar to one reached at Torstar Corp. 's Toronto Star newspaper earlier this month, the 500 Globe and Mail workers will see a raise of 8% in the contract's first year and 7% in each of the following two years. 

Lorne Slotnick, vice chairman of the Southern Ontario Newspaper Guild, the union representing the workers, said Thomson made significant concessions in the final round of talks.
In addition to wage increases, the union negotiated improved vacation plans, benefit packages and pension plans, Mr. Slotnick said. 

He said more than 70% of the bargaining unit voted in favor of the agreement.
