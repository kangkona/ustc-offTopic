The Singapore and Kuala Lumpur stock exchanges are bracing for a turbulent separation, following Malaysian Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin's long-awaited announcement that the exchanges will sever ties. 

On Friday, Datuk Daim added spice to an otherwise unremarkable address on Malaysia's proposed budget for 1990 by ordering the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange "to take appropriate action immediately" to cut its links with the Stock Exchange of Singapore. 

The delisting of Malaysian-based companies from the Singapore exchange may not be a smooth process, analysts say.
Though the split has long been expected, the exchanges aren't fully prepared to go their separate ways. 

The finance minister's order wasn't sparked by a single event and doesn't indicate a souring in relations between the neighboring countries.
Rather, the two closely linked exchanges have been drifting apart for some years, with a nearly five-year-old moratorium on new dual listings, separate and different listing requirements, differing trading and settlement guidelines and diverging national-policy aims.
