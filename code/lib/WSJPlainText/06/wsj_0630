Lion Nathan Ltd., a New Zealand brewing and retail concern, said Friday that Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. is "committed" to a transaction whereby Lion Nathan would acquire 50% of Bond's Australian brewing assets. 

Lion Nathan issued a statement saying it is applying to Australia's National Companies & Securities Commission, the nation's corporate watchdog agency, for a modification to takeover regulations "similar to that obtained by" S.A. Brewing Holdings Ltd. 

SA Brewing, an Australian brewer, last Thursday was given approval to acquire an option for up to 20% of Bell Resources Ltd., a unit of Bond Corp. 

Bell Resources is acquiring Bond's brewing businesses for 2.5 billion Australian dollars (US$1.9 billion). 

S.A. brewing would make a takeover offer for all of Bell Resources if it exercises the option, according to the commission. 

Bond Corp., a brewing, property, media and resources company, is selling many of its assets to reduce its debts. 

"Lion Nathan has a concluded contract with Bond and Bell Resources," said Douglas Myers, chief executive of Lion Nathan.
