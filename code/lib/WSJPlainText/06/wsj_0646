MEDICINE SHOPPE INTERNATIONAL Inc. declared a 3-for-2 stock split, and substantially boosted the dividend payout.
The franchiser of pharmacies said the added shares will be distributed Dec. 4 to stock of record Nov. 13.
The company also changed its dividend policy, under which holders had received an annual 10 cents-a-share payment, by declaring a four-cents-a-share dividend, to be paid quarterly on post-split shares.
