Milton Petrie, chairman of Petrie Stores Corp., said he has agreed to sell his 15.2% stake in Deb Shops Corp. to Petrie Stores. 

In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Petrie said that on Oct. 26 Petrie Stores agreed to purchase Mr. Petrie's 2,331,100 Deb Shops shares.
The transaction will take place tomorrow. 

The filing said Petrie Stores of Secaucus, N.J., is purchasing Mr. Petrie's Deb Shops stake as an investment.
Although Petrie Stores has considered seeking to acquire the remaining equity of Deb Stores, it has no current intention to pursue such a possibility, the filing said. 

Philadelphia-based Deb Shops said it saw little significance in Mr. Petrie selling his stock to Petrie Stores. "We didn't look at it and say, `Oh my God, something is going to happen, '" said Stanley Uhr, vice president and corporate counsel. 

Mr. Uhr said that Mr. Petrie or his company have been accumulating Deb Shops stock for several years, each time issuing a similar regulatory statement.
He said no discussions currently are taking place between the two companies.
