Rally's Inc. said it filed suit in U.S. District Court in Delaware against a group led by Burt Sugarman, seeking to block the investors from buying more shares. 

Rally's, a Louisville, Ky., fast-food chain, alleges that the three investors, who are directors of the company, broke securities laws because they didn't disclose their intentions to acquire a big Rally's stake. 

The group, led by Giant Group Ltd. and its chairman, Mr. Sugarman, owns about 45.2% of Rally's.
In the Securities and Exchange Commission filings, the group has said it may seek control of Rally's. 

Mr. Sugarman called the lawsuit "not nice" and said his group will continue to push for control of the company and the removal of certain directors. 

He asserts that some directors, who have joined forces with company founder James Patterson, have ties to Wendy's, a competing hamburger chain.
The Patterson group, which controls about 42% of Rally's shares, also may seek control. 

Rally's also said it formed a committee of three directors, who aren't associated with either the Patterson or Sugarman groups, to analyze the situation.
