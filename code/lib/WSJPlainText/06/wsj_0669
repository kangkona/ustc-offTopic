Nissan Motor Co. expects net income to reach 120 billion yen (U.S. $857 million) in its current fiscal year, up from 114.6 billion yen in the previous year, Yutaka Kume, president, said. 

Mr. Kume made the earnings projection for fiscal 1990, ending next March 31, in an interview with U.S. automotive writers attending the Tokyo Motor Show. 

The executive said that the anticipated earnings increase is fairly modest because Nissan is spending heavily to bolster its dealership network in Japan and because of currency-exchange fluctuations. 

During the next decade, Mr. Kume said, Nissan plans to boost overseas vehicle production sufficiently to account for a majority of sales outside Japan.
Last year, Mr. Kume said, Nissan exported slightly over one million vehicles, and produced 570,000 cars and trucks at its factories in North America, Europe and Australia.
But by 1992, he added, Nissan will build one million vehicles a year outside Japan, or sufficient to equal exports. 

"By the end of the 1990s," he said, "we want to be producing roughly two vehicles overseas for every vehicle that we export from Japan." That will involve a substantial increase in overseas manufacturing capacity, he acknowledged, but didn't provide specific details.
