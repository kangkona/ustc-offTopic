This maker of electronic devices said it replaced all five incumbent directors at a special meeting called by Milton B. Hollander, whose High Technology Holding Co. of Stamford, Conn. acquired most of its 49.4% stake in Newport in August.
Elected as directors were Mr. Hollander, Frederick Ezekiel, Frederick Ross, Arthur B. Crozier and Rose Pothier.
Removed from office were George Pratt, Robert E. Davis, Norman Gray, John Virtue, corporate secretary, and Barrett B. Weekes, chairman, president and chief executive officer.
Newport officials didn't respond Friday to requests to discuss the changes at the company but earlier, Mr. Weekes had said Mr. Hollander wanted to have his own team on the board.
