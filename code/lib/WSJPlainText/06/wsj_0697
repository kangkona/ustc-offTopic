DPC Acquisition Partners, a hostile suitor for Dataproducts Corp., filed a petition in federal district court in Los Angeles seeking to have its standstill agreement with the computer printer maker declared void, and it proceeded with a $10-a-share tender offer for the company. 

The offer would give the transaction an indicated value of $189 million, based on the 18.9 million shares the group doesn't already own.
DPC holds about 7.8% of Dataproducts' shares. 

Lawyers representing DPC declined to elaborate, saying they didn't have a final copy of the filing.
Jack Davis, Dataproducts' chairman, said he hadn't yet seen the filing and couldn't comment. 

DPC made a $15-a-share bid for the company in May, but Dataproducts management considered the $283.7 million proposal unacceptable.
Dataproducts had sought a buyer for several months, but it is now in the midst of a restructuring plan and management says the company is no longer for sale.
