Treasury bonds ended modestly higher yesterday on growing speculation that the Federal Reserve is allowing interest rates to ease slightly. 

But junk bond prices fell again, as an already fragile high-yield market grew increasingly skittish.
High-grade corporates, mortgage securities and municipals followed the movement of Treasurys. 

Several economists and money managers on Wall Street contend that the softness in the federal funds rate, which fell 1/4 percentage point to 8 3/4% yesterday, is a sign that the nation's central bank loosened credit conditions.
The rate, which in recent years has been the Fed's principal policy target, is the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans. 

"I think the easing has started again and we're on our way to a funds rate of 8 1/2%," said Donald Fine, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank.
He said the Fed is taking the action because of indications that the manufacturing sector is growing weaker. "This is not a major move, it's merely a continuation of the Fed's accommodative position." 

But some investors were skeptical, noting that they've been burned many times in recent months by rushing to buy bonds on the expectation that lower rates would soon arrive. 

And there was no indication from government officials that Fed policy-makers agreed to ease monetary policy.
Indeed, some members of the Fed's open market committee, which would have to approve any significant policy shift, yesterday reaffirmed their views that the latest data suggest the economy is slowing just about as much as the Fed desired and no more. 

"It's still too early to say that there's enough accumulating evidence" that the economy is headed for a recession, said Roger Guffey, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo. 

But on Wall Street, some economists are turning a deaf ear to such statements. 

Maria Fiorini Ramirez, money-market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., contends that the Fed had several chances to aggressively counteract the falling funds rate.
But when the central bank took no action to prevent the decline, "for all intents and purposes, it confirmed that the Fed eased," she said. "My experience in watching the Fed is to watch what they do instead of listening to what they say," she said. 

However, others weren't so quick to jump to conclusions.
Their skepticism, combined with caution ahead of new supply and today's release of the September producer price index, blunted the bond market's advance. 

Irwin Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Bank, said the talk of Fed easing was much ado about nothing. 

"This would be an odd time to make an overt move toward ease in view of the fact that there is a big PPI number expected," he said. "If the Fed was going to ease because of the state of the economy, it would have done so on Friday after the weak employment data was released." In addition to the PPI report, data on September retail sales will be released today. 

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report expect, on average, a 0.8% rise in the September PPI and a drop of less than 0.1% in retail sales. 

Treasury bonds, which had risen as much as 3/8 point on talk of Fed easing, sold off late in the day after Resolution Funding Corp. announced it would hold its first bond auction Oct. 25. 

Resolution Funding is a division of Resolution Trust Corp., the new federal agency created to bail out the nation's troubled savings and loans.
The amount and maturity of the first auction will be announced Wednesday.
The market consensus is that the offering will consist of as much as $5 billion of 30-year securities. 

"The announcement took away some of the bullish sentiment," said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. "The thought of more new supply put pressure on the market," he said. 

The benchmark 30-year bond ended about 1/8 point higher, or up about $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount. 

Junk bonds closed about 1/4 point lower, continuing to react to Wednesday's news that Ramada Inc. pulled a $400 million junk bond offering for Aztar Corp. 

Treasury, Agency Securities 

Treasury securities were modestly higher yesterday.
The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at 100 27/32 to yield 8.02%, compared with 100 24/32 to yield 8.05% Wednesday.
The latest 10-year notes were quoted at 99 17/32 to yield 8.025%, compared with 99 13/32 to yield 8.067% Wednesday.
Two-year notes were quoted at 100 20/32 to yield 7.989%, compared with 100 15/32 to yield 8.076%. 

Short-term rates were essentially unchanged.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was 7.72% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.95%, while six-month bills had a discount rate of 7.66% for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.01%. 

In the agency market, $900 million of seven-year Federal National Mortgage Association debentures came to market yielding 8.474%.
The new issue was priced at 99.875 with an 8.45% coupon. 

Corporate, Other Issues 

Investment-grade corporate bonds ended unchanged to 1/4 point higher. 

In the high-yield market, RJR Holdings Capital Corp. 's 14.7% convertible pay-in-kind securities, which fell as much as two points Wednesday, closed off 3/4 point yesterday to finish at 95 5/8. 

In the new-issue market, more than $600 million of corporate debt was issued yesterday, including a $200 million offering by Exxon Capital Corp.
The non-callable notes were priced to yield 8.312%. 

Continental Bank Corp. tapped the market with a $150 million issue of floating-rate notes, maturing Oct. 18, 1994. 

As expected, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation's largest electric utility, said it will price $3 billion in securities next week.
The three-part offering includes $1.5 billion in 30-year bonds and $750 million each in five-year and 10-year bonds. 

The TVA decided to proceed with the offering following an accord last week with the Treasury's Federal Financing Bank that allows the TVA to keep borrowing short term from the bank for two years after it goes to the public market.
The bank had contended that the TVA couldn't borrow from both it and the public market. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities 

Mortgage securities gained 2/32 to 9/32 point after moderate trading. 

In the derivative market, new-issue activity slowed after a busy session Wednesday, when five real estate mortgage investment conduits totaling $2 billion were priced. 

The only Remic priced yesterday was a Federal National Mortgage Association issue of $400 million underwritten by Morgan Stanley & Co. 

Meanwhile, in the pass-through sector, Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for October delivery ended at 97 30/32, up 7/32; 9 1/2% securities at 100 1/32, up 6/32; 10% securities at 101 31/32, up 3/32; 10 1/2% securities at 103 18/ 32, up 2/32.
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9% securities rose 9/32 to 97 6/32.
Traders noted strong demand for Ginnie Mae 9 1/2% securities in recent sessions, particularly when the securities dipped below 100. 

The Ginnie Mae 9% issue was yielding 9.41% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the 10-year Treasury note held at 1.38 percentage points. 

Municipals 

A strong reception for California's $450 million general obligation bond sale kept a floor under municipals, but worries over potential institutional selling pressure kept the market from posting more than modest advances. 

Active municipal dollar bonds were flat to 3/8 point higher in late dealings, but serial bonds were relatively unchanged on the day, according to traders. 

A Bank of America NT&SA-run account had the winning bid for the California issue, the state's largest general obligation offering ever.
The group's bid produced a 6.634% true interest cost. 

The bonds, rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard & Poor's Corp., were priced to yield from 5.75% in 1990 to 6.80% in 2005.
Bonds due 2006-2009 were priced to yield 6.70%. 

Traders termed the yields aggressive, yet presale demand was such that the underwriters were accepting orders from the general market by late afternoon only for bonds due in 1993-1999, 2006 and 2008. 

But concerns that major institutional investors may be heavy sellers of tax-exempts in the near-term continued to plague the market.
The worries were deepened by the $526.4 million bid list put up for sale Wednesday through Chemical Securities Inc. by an unspecified customer. 

Foreign Bonds 

Interest rates and inflation weighed heavily on the Japanese government bond market, which ended lower one day after the Bank of Japan raised its discount rate. 

"The dollar has a very good bid," and "the money market is pricing in another discount-rate hike," a yen-bond trader said. 

And for Japan the specter of imported inflation looms because the dollar's cost could compound the firm price of oil, which is denominated in dollars. 

The benchmark Persian Gulf crude oil that Japan imports is near $16 a barrel, up from $10.50 a year earlier.
Meanwhile, the dollar is up about 10% from a year ago. 

Neither oil prices nor the dollar is expected to soften in the next few months as demand for both is expected to remain firm, so the worst inflation news may still be ahead for Japan. 

Japan's benchmark No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers screens at 98.84, down 0.20.
The yield was 5.475%. 

West German bonds also fell.
The Treasury's 6 3/4% issue due June 1999 closed down 0.04 point at 97.74 to yield 7.07%, while the 6 3/4% notes due 1994 fell 0.15 point to 97.65 to yield 7.37%. 

British government bonds ended mixed, with underlying sentiment still bearish.
The Treasury's 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 rose 5/32 to 110 21/32 for a yield of 10.24%, while the 11 3/4% notes due 1991 fell 1/32 to 98 1/4 to yield 13.23%.
