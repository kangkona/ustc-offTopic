Coca-Cola Co. said third-quarter earnings jumped 22%, as a surge in international sales made up for disappointing domestic results. 

The giant soft-drink company posted net income of $361.3 million, or $1.03 a share, up from $295.6 million, or 81 cents a share, a year earlier.
The most recent quarter included a gain of $36 million, or 10 cents a share, from the sale of bottled-water operations. 

Revenue rose 8.2% to $2.30 billion from $2.13 billion a year earlier, due largely to a 14% jump in international volume. 

"Overseas operations are the bread and butter of Coca-Cola, and those performed well," said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with PaineWebber in San Francisco.
He noted that about 80% of the company's earnings come from international operations. 

The 14% increase in international gallon sales well exceeded the 8% to 10% goal the company had set. "A 14% increase on top of a very big base is a very strong performance," said Randy Donaldson, a Coke spokesman. 

The company said a variety of factors, including promotional activities and the rollout of new products -- including Sprite in Britain -- contributed to the strong growth in most overseas markets.
Unit volume in Europe showed a strong 17% growth, while Japan, another major market, showed an increase of 10%. 

The firming of the dollar against foreign currencies had a small effect of reducing net income by about one cent in the quarter and five cents for the nine months. 

In contrast to the performance overseas, domestic unit case sales were flat in the third quarter, and sales of gallons of concentrate dropped 2%.
The company attributed the results to consumers balking at higher prices and sluggish times in the restaurant business.
Domestic results "are modestly disappointing," said George Thompson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities.
He said an unusually rainy summer in many parts of the U.S. also hurt sales. 

Coca-Cola said chilled orange-juice volume rose 25% in the quarter due to growth of its Minute Maid Premium Choice orange juice and a new 96-ounce plastic bottle for its chilled orange juice that comes from concentrate.
However, frozen orange-juice volume plummeted 33% as consumers continue to shift to the chilled juice. 

For the nine months, Coca-Cola reported net income rose 19% to $966.6 million from $809.2 million last year, while revenue increased 6.4% for the nine months to $6.72 billion from $6.31 billion a year earlier.
