General Electric Co. said third-quarter net income rose 16%, reflecting widespread productivity improvements and sales growth in a number of businesses. 

The consumer and industrial products and broadcasting concern said net rose to $945 million, or $1.04 a share, from $815 million, or 90 cents a share, a year earlier.
GE said operating margin as a percentage of sales was 11.1%, up from 9.6% a year ago.
Consolidated revenue rose 6.5%, to $12.98 billion from $12.19 billion. 

John F. Welch Jr., chairman, cited strong earnings gains in the company's financial services, plastics, transportation systems and power generation systems.
He reiterated GE's expectation that full-year earnings would increase in the strong double digits. 

"As expected they were right on target" in terms of profit, said Linda Shuman, an analyst with Prudential Bache Research.
Ms. Shuman said that although the revenue gain was a little lighter than she had thought, profit margins were a little better.
Ms. Shuman said that financial services had a "great quarter." 

GE Financial Services posted a 21% earnings gain, to $245 million, led by GE Capital Corp. Major appliances operating profit was "substantially above" depressed levels of a year ago on slightly higher revenue.
Broadcasting operating profit was flat compared with a year ago, despite the year-ago revenue from the 1988 Olympic Games.
But aerospace operating profit fell on "modestly lower sales." 

GE said firm aircraft-engine orders total almost $6 billion so far this year, while the aerospace business received more than $4 billion in firm orders for the nine months.
Power-generation orders spurted almost 60% from a year ago, to $3 billion, while equipment orders for medical systems also were very strong. 

For the nine months, GE net rose 16%, to $2.77 billion, or $3.06 a share, from $2.38 billion, or $2.63 a share, a year ago.
Consolidated revenue rose 11%, to $38.4 billion from $34.6 billion.
