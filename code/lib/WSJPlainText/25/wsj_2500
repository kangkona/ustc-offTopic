MEI Diversified Inc. agreed to acquire LecTec Corp. for stock currently worth $17.6 million.
In a related transaction, the two also agreed MEI will help LecTec finance a $42-million purchase of a Baxter International Inc. unit. 

The agreement, which requires approval by both regulators and LecTec stockholders, calls for LecTec holders to receive for each of their common shares nine-tenths of an MEI common share.
The pact represents a slight sweetening from the 0.88 MEI share LecTec holders would have received under an earlier tentative agreement. 

In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, LecTec shares moved up 12.5 cents to close at $5.375; MEI shares were unchanged at $6.375 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading. 

LecTec, which makes medical products for the skin, also agreed with Baxter to acquire its New Dimensions in Medicine unit for $42 million and assumption of some debt.
New Dimensions, a unit of Baxter's operating-room division, manufactures electrodes, cables and electrosurgical products. 

MEI and LecTec agreed that MEI -- a snack and health-food distributor that has said it is seeking to expand into other fields -- will provide financing for LecTec's purchase of New Dimensions.
The purchase is expected to be completed within a month.
MEI's owners include investor Irwin Jacobs. 

Baxter, a manufacturer of health-care products based in Deerfield, Ill., will distribute New Dimensions products -- and probably some LecTec products, too -- according to contract terms. 

Baxter said it is selling New Dimensions because its operating-room division is now focusing on products solely used in hospital operating rooms.
Annual sales for New Dimensions range from $35 million to $40 million; the acquisition overshadows Lectec's own annual sales of about $6 million.
