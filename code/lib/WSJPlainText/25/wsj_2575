Willamette Industries Inc. and Potlatch Corp. reported strong earnings gains for the third quarter, but another Northwest forest-products company, Boise Cascade Corp., posted a decline. 

Willamette and Potlatch cited favorable lumber prices or strong demand for pulp and paperboard products for their gains.
Boise Cascade blamed soft demand for paper and paper products for its decrease. 

Boise Cascade said earnings fell 13% in the third quarter to $62.8 million, or $1.34 a share, from $71.9 million, or $1.58 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose slightly to $1.08 billion from $1.04 billion.
For the nine months, the company said it earned $216.3 million, or $4.76 a share, up slightly from $212.7 million, or $4.64 a share.
Revenue amounted to $3.28 billion, up 7% from $3.06 billion. 

While other product lines improved, Boise Cascade's paper and paper-products segment posted a 31% drop in operating income to $93.5 million.
The company said demand for uncoated white paper, coated grades and newsprint slowed while new capacity came on line and wood-chip costs rose "dramatically higher" in the Northwest. 

Willamette said it earned $52.9 million, or $2.08 a share, up 35% from $39 million, or $1.54 a share in the year-earlier period.
Sales increased 10% to $486.6 million from $441 million.
The rate of earnings growth was seven times the 5% growth rate of the prior six months.
For the nine months, Willamette reported net income of $139.8 million, or $5.50 a share, up 15% from $121.7 million, or $4.79 a share, in the 1988 period.
Sales rose 11% to $1.42 billion from $1.27 billion. 

Potlatch reported net income of $35.1 million, or $1.22 a share, for the third quarter, up 24% from $28.3 million, or $1.02 a share, in the year-earlier period.
Sales increased 16% to $318.4 million from $273.7 million.
Earnings had risen 21% in the first half.
For the nine months, Potlatch said it earned $96.8 million, or $3.41 a share, up 22% from $79.3 million, or $2.85 a share.
Sales totaled $911.9 million, up 14% from $798.7 million. 

Potlatch said the earnings gains were achieved despite continuing problems at its Lewiston, Idaho, sawmill and with new equipment at its Cloquet, Minn., paper mill.
Willamette said its third-quarter earnings were reduced by a $1.2 million pretax write-off for timber losses from Hurricane Hugo in the Carolinas. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Boise Cascade fell 37.5 cents a share, to $42.875, and Potlatch closed at $35.75, up 12.5 cents.
In over-the-counter trading, Willamette closed at $51.75, up $1.25.
