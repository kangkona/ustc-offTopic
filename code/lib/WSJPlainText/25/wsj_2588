Spalding Sports Worldwide said it reached a "multimillion-dollar" settlement in two suits against Wilson Sporting Goods Co. for alleged patent infringements of its golf-ball cover and optical brightener that enhances the whiteness of golf balls. 

The out-of-court settlement follows a July 5 ruling by a federal judge that Acushnet Co., another golf-ball maker, infringed on Spalding's patented blended Surlyn cover that adds distance to player's shots, resists cracking and makes balls more durable.
Acushnet has appealed. 

Financial details of the settlement were not disclosed, but Spalding has agreed to grant a continuing license to Wilson to produce Wilson Staff and Ultra golf balls without modifications. 

Spalding, a Chicopee, Mass., unit of closely held Spalding & Evenflo Cos. of Tampa, Fla., has become the leader in the highly competitive golf-ball business with the help of its Surlyn cover. 

A spokesman for Wilson, a unit of Amer Group Ltd. of Finland, said the company is "pleased to have finally resolved this matter which has dragged on for several years."
