The Canadian government introduced an amended bill in the House of Commons aimed at increasing the amount of Canadian programming shown on Canadian television stations. 

The bill "will offer a greater choice of more and better Canadian programming, enriching Canadian life and strengthening Canadian identity," Communications Minister Marcel Masse said. 

The bill instructs the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, a regulatory agency, to provide financial incentives to privately owned television networks to use more Canadian material than the current quota of 50% in prime time. 

The bill also states that programming carried on the government-owned Canadian Broadcasting Corp. should be "predominantly and distinctively Canadian." The corporation has its own objective of boosting Canadian content on prime time to 95% from its current level of 60%. 

The new bill also instructs cable companies to give preference to Canadian programming and permits them to produce programming. 

The bill is very similar to one that was passed by the House of Commons last year but that didn't get Senate approval before the November 1988 federal election.
