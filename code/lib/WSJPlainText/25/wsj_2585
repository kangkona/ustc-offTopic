Mesa Airlines Inc., Farmington, N.M., said it has "no interest" in a merger proposal from its tiny rival, StatesWest Airlines. 

In a strongly worded statement, Mesa's board said it doesn't want to merge with Phoenix-based StatesWest because of the latter's operating history. "We see no benefit to Mesa," the statement said. "Any discussions would compromise Mesa's competitive strategy." 

StatesWest hasn't yet turned a profit after three years of operation.
It flies four twin-engine turboprop planes to and from 10 cities in the Southwest.
Ten-year-old Mesa, which operates 22 planes to 42 cities, last posted net income of $372,949 on revenue of $15.7 million for the nine months ended June 30. 

StatesWest wouldn't disclose -- to Mesa or to the public -- the terms of its proposed merger, asking instead for a meeting to discuss its plan.
StatesWest, which acquired 7.25% of Mesa's common outstanding in May, said it is prepared to make a tender offer for the rest. 

Mesa's board declined to meet with StatesWest officials but said it is obliged to consider any cash offer for all its stock.
