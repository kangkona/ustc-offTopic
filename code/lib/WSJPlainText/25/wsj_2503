Continental Health Affiliates Inc. said it is considering a restructuring that may involve selling one or both of its infusion-therapy and home-nursing businesses. 

The health-care-services company said separating its businesses would increase shareholder value "in light of values recently placed on the infusion-therapy business." The company was referring to recent acquisitions in the industry.
An official said there has been much interest in the company recently. 

He said that if both businesses were sold the company would be left with its nursing-homes/retirement-living business, roughly one-third of its overall business.
The company didn't say how much it expects the businesses to fetch. 

In over-the-counter trading, Continental Health closed at $4.875 a share, up $1. 

Continental Health said it hired Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to explore the sale of the businesses.
Continental Health also is considering other options, including a spinoff of a division. 

The company said it sold almost all of its shares in Healthdyne Inc., a Marietta, Ga., health-care-services and electronicmedical-equipment concern.
Last year, Continental Health unsuccessfully bid for Healthdyne, offering as much as $7 a share, or $105 million.
Healthdyne rebuffed the advance and restructured.
Continental, which at one time held 7.4% of the company, said overall, it sold its Healthdyne shares at a premium, which it will disclose when it reports third-quarter results.
