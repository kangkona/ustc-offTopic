Stock prices drifted lower as concerns about the imminent report on September producer prices fueled continued profit-taking. 

The market also was hurt by disappointing third-quarter earnings reports and estimates, including one from Chrysler, and nervousness about the junk-bond market, which acted as a catalyst for selling in takeover stocks. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded its third consecutive decline by falling 13.52 to 2759.84.
Since setting the last in a series of record highs Monday, the average has fallen 31.57 points, or 1.1%. 

Among broader market averages, Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index fell 1.60 to 355.39, the Dow Jones Equity Market Index went down 1.44 to 333.57 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index dropped 0.83 to 196.98.
Some 907 issues declined in price on the New York Stock Exchange; only 543 advanced. 

The pace of trading slackened as players sat out the session to await the release of the producer price report, along with data on September retail sales, before today's opening.
Big Board volume totaled 160,120,000 shares, down from 164,070,000 Wednesday. 

Higher energy and auto prices are expected to bring a sharp increase in the September PPI, which went down 0.4% in both July and August.

Traders expressed concern that the data, coming on the heels of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's indications that the Fed won't lower interest rates to rein in the dollar, may worsen the rate outlook even further. "There are some expectations for disappointment," said Jerome M. Hinkle, a block trader at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. 

As a result, market players took little comfort in indications that the Fed might be moving to ease monetary policy by permitting a decline in the federal funds rate, which banks charge one another on overnight loans.
But Charles Clough, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch & Co., said the market's decline in the face of that evidence was a sign that concerns about earnings, rather than rates, are starting to take center stage. 

"You're clearly going to have to deal with more weak earnings in a number of sectors," he said. "The question is whether the market is finally coming to grips with some of those earnings problems." 

Chrysler dropped 5/8 to 24.
The company told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report it expects to post break-even results for the third quarter, excluding a $310 million gain resulting from the sale of 45% of its stake in Japan's Mitsubishi Motors. 

Analysts had been expecting the company to report a third-quarter profit of 20 cents to 25 cents a share without the gains, and they cited overspending on incentive programs as the major factor behind the shortfall. 

Other disappointing third-quarter earnings estimates produced sell-offs in Owens-Corning Fiberglas, which dropped 2 7/8 to 30 3/4, and IMO Industries, which skidded 2 7/8 to 17 3/4.
Both companies said their results would trail year-earlier levels.

Boeing added 1 7/8 to 61 3/8.
As expected, the company received a jet aircraft order from Northwest Airlines, an NWA unit, worth as much as $5.2 billion.

Elsewhere on the earnings front, Rowan Cos., which reported a third-quarter loss of eight cents a share, went down 5/8 to 8 1/4.

Bairnco fell 1 1/4 to 19.
