The Chicago Board Options Exchange said it plans to offer its first non-option product, the "Market Basket," the week of Oct. 23, pending approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

"For the first time, investors will be able to buy a basket of stocks as a single unit at a single price on an exchange floor," said an exchange official. 

The CBOE's new investment vehicle is aimed at institutional traders who want to use it as a way to facilitate making multimillion dollar trades in and out of the stock market.
It will shortly meet stiff competition from the New York Stock Exchange, which is expected to launch its own version of a stock-basket product in the near future. 

The new vehicle is one of a number of market-basket products designed since the October 1987 stock-market crash to compete with the S&P 500 Futures Index contract traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
