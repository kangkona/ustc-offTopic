A stronger dollar helped Japan's global trade surplus narrow for the fifth month in a row.
But the surplus with the U.S. widened, and analysts cautioned that the weaker yen is starting to encourage Japanese exports. 

Japan's global trade surplus, measured on a customs-cleared basis, fell 6.7% in September from a year earlier, to $7.24 billion from $7.76 billion, the Finance Ministry said.
Imports increased 10.6% to $17.05 billion, while exports rose 4.8% to $24.29 billion. 

The surplus with the U.S., however, widened for the first time in three months, growing 2.8% from a year earlier to $4.78 billion.
Imports from the U.S. rose 12.3%, to $3.88 billion, while exports to the U.S. rose 6.8%, to $8.67 billion. 

Analysts said the narrowing of Japan's global trade surplus in September was due largely to the dollar's 8.1% rise against the yen from a year earlier.
Indeed, when calculated in yen, the September trade surplus actually widened 1.1%, to 1.05 trillion yen from 1.04 trillion yen a year earlier. 

A rising dollar makes imports less attractive in Japan and the nation's exports more competitive, thereby increasing the potential for Japan's surplus to rise in the long run.
But in the short term, a stronger dollar means the surplus appears smaller when stated in dollars. 

Strong domestic demand kept the growth of imports at a high level in September, surpassing that of exports even in yen terms.
But some special factors lay behind the sharp increase in imports.
Crude oil imports totaled $1.71 billion, up 46.3% from a year earlier, because a new oil tax imposed in August 1988 temporarily discouraged demand the following month. 

The dollar value of exports, meanwhile, was suppressed by the strong dollar, although volume showed some sizable increases.
Exports of video cameras dropped 0.6% in dollar terms, but rose 12.5% in volume.
Auto-parts exports rose 12.7% in value, but jumped 22.8% in volume. 

Such a steep rise in export volume surprised some analysts, especially as Japan has started to make more goods abroad.
And should the dollar remain at this high level, economists warned, exports will be stimulated even further. 

"The yen's weakening could lead to export price cuts," said David Pike, an economist for UBS Phillips & Drew International Ltd. Neither policy coordination by the Group of Seven industrialized countries nor the increase in Japan's discount rate Wednesday has stopped the dollar's rise. 

After seasonal adjustment, the September trade surplus stood at $5.55 billion, up 27% from August's $4.37 billion.
Adjusted imports fell 7% to $17.73 billion, while adjusted exports fell 0.6% to $23.28 billion.
