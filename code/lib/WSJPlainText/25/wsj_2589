Pacific Telesis Group's Pacific Bell subsidiary will be allowed to earn a return of as much as 14.75%, compared with a current actual return of about 13%, under a plan adopted by California regulators. 

The plan takes effect Jan. 1 and is to be reviewed in 1992.
In San Francisco, Gary McBee, executive vice president of Pacific Bell, said the plan protects consumers by limiting price increases for basic telephone service to the amount by which the inflation rate exceeds 4.5%. 

"Overall, it's a good decision that provides the appropriate incentives," Mr. McBee said. 

Analyst Robert Morris III of Goldman, Sachs & Co. said the plan should allow Pacific Telesis to increase earnings by about 20 cents a share over the next several years, taking into account a rate reduction that is due to be approved this year.
Mr. Morris said the rate reduction could be as large as $250 million, in which case he would reduce his 1990 earnings estimate on the telephone operating company to about $3.15 a share from $3.25 a share.
