British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson pledged to continue the government's strategy of fighting inflation with a strong pound and high interest rates for as long as necessary. 

But in a speech at the Conservative Party's annual conference, he declined to announce any policy change to provide explicit support for the beleaguered pound.
Mr. Lawson also warned there are "no easy answers" to the problems facing the British economy. 

He also avoided any mention of the government's timing to take the pound into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. 

Ian Harwood, senior economist at Warburg Securities, said the currency markets were disappointed by Mr. Lawson's failure to explain how he intends to continue supporting the pound. 

After the party speech, Mr. Lawson refused to comment on suggestions that he might outline the government's EMS moves in his annual speech to the London financial community. 

That address traditionally includes comments on monetary policy and a review of the government's economic achievements of the past year.
Warburg's Mr. Harwood noted that the speech has also been used as "a platform for the announcement of policy changes."
