L'Oreal S.A. said group profit before taxes, profit-sharing and nonrecurring items climbed 18% to 1.51 billion francs ($233 million) in the first half of 1989 from 1.28 billion francs a year earlier. 

The Paris-based cosmetics group said the advance was fueled by a 17% revenue gain, to 14.55 billion francs from 12.39 billion.
It didn't specify whether it recorded any nonrecurring items in the half. 

L'Oreal said its main cosmetics operations posted a 20% revenue gain for the period, but didn't elaborate further on the interim results. 

For all of 1988, L'Oreal had group profit of 1.35 billion francs on revenue of 24.45 billion francs.
