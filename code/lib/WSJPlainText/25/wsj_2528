Cautious investors and traders took profits a bit more gingerly in the over-the-counter stock market than was the case elsewhere. 

While the Dow Jones Industrial Average and New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell, the Nasdaq Composite Index was up a slim 0.03, to 482.19. 

Although some profit-taking occurred on Nasdaq, traders said investors weren't going overboard. "Everybody's kind of tight on the Street; there isn't much for sale," said Ralph Costanza, managing director of the OTC trading department at Smith Barney, Harris Upham.
Mr. Costanza said OTC market makers have been carrying low stock inventories for some time.
Firms making markets in OTC stocks must keep shares of stocks on hand to facilitate trading when order imbalances occur. 

Brokerage firms' decisions to keep inventories low means they aren't active buyers of stock that's for sale.
But the low supply also means there is less stock to unload when the market turns soft. 

Of the 4,346 stocks that changed hands, 916 advanced and 983 declined.
Volume was a shade under 131 million shares, about average for this year. 

In yesterday's action, Class B shares of Laidlaw Transportation climbed 1 1/4 to 20 5/8 on 3.9 million shares after Wednesday's announcement of higher-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings.
The waste removal and transportation services concern said earnings for the quarter ended Aug. 31 jumped to 32 cents a share from 19 cents a share a year earlier. 

Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said analysts at Merrill Lynch and Smith Barney raised their fiscal 1990 estimates for Laidlaw and reiterated their "buy" recommendations on the stock. 

Great American Communications rose 1/4 to 12 1/4 on 274,000 shares.
The company said it exchanged $50 million in debentures and notes for 3,650,000 of its common shares at $12 a share.
On Wednesday, the broadcasting concern, formerly known as Taft Broadcasting, was Nasdaq's most active issue, with total volume of 4.8 million shares. 

Although MGM/UA terminated its buyout pact with suitor Qintex Australia earlier this week, there appeared to be a remote possibility that the agreement could be revived. 

This newspaper reported that National Broadcasting Co. had earlier agreed to be an equity partner in MGM/UA's buy-out by the Australian company, which might lure MGM/UA back to the negotiating table.
But MGM/UA officials have declined to comment on whether they are willing to reopen the talks. 

Qintex Entertainment, which is 43%-owned by the Australian firm, jumped 1 1/4 to 5 1/4 on 418,200 shares, three times its average daily volume.
Qintex Entertainment said it isn't a party to the terminated merger agreement, however. 

Jaguar's American depositary receipts added 3/8 to 10 1/2 on volume of 1.6 million. 

MCI Communications gained 5/8 to 45 3/4 on 1.3 million shares. 

Mobile Telecommunications Technologies finished unchanged at 10 7/8 on 1.4 million shares.
The company has priced 3,450,000 of its common shares for sale at $10.75 each. 

Landmark Graphics fell 1 1/4 to 15 1/2 on 1.2 million shares.
The maker of computer systems for oil and gas exploration said net income for the period ended Sept. 30 rose to $1.8 million, or 22 cents a share, from $1.2 million, or 21 cents. 

McCaw Cellular Communications added 1/2 to 43 1/2 on one million shares.
The cellular communications concern's triple-Crated subordinated debt has been on Standard & Poor's CreditWatch surveillance list since January for a possible ratings upgrade.
Yesterday, the rating concern said recent events could reduce the likelihood of a rating upgrade. 

McCaw has offered to acquire Metromedia's New York City cellular telephone interests and, in a separate transaction, sell certain McCaw properties to Contel Cellular.
In addition, McCaw revised its previous tender offer for shares of LIN Broadcasting to $125 a share for 22 million LIN shares it doesn't already own.
Earlier, it had offered to pay $110 a share for 90% of LIN. 

Among other active stocks, Lotus Development gained 1 1/2 to 31 3/4, Tele-Communications lost 1 to 20 3/8 and Intel rose 1/4 to 33 7/8.
