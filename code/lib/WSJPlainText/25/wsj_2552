NWA Inc. confirmed that it placed an order with Boeing Co. for as many as 90 jetliners for a total $5.2 billion. 

The order by the Minneapolis-based parent of Northwest Airlines was for $2.7 billion of 40 mid-range 757s and six long-range 747-400 jumbo jets.
The remaining amount represents the value of 40 options for the 757 narrow-bodied jetliners and four options for the 747-400s. 

Until the carrier's new owner, Alfred Checchi took control of NWA in August following a $3.65 billion buy-out, many industry observers figured that Europe's Airbus Industrie had the inside track on winning plane orders from NWA. 

In recent years, Airbus had won Northwest orders and options for 136 planes in large part because it had forged a strong relationship with Steven G. Rothmeier, who resigned two weeks ago amid reports that he was chafing under the company's new ownership.
