Phoenix Canada Oil Co. said it submitted a tentative offer to buy all the units outstanding of OKC Limited Partnership for $4.50 each, or about $90 million. 

Phoenix Canada said the price could be paid in cash or a combination of cash and securities, depending on the outcome of negotiations with OKC. 

Phoenix Canada is an oil and gas producer.
OKC is a Dallas-based oil and gas partnership. 

In Dallas, the general partners of OKC said they are prepared to negotiate a transaction, but they believe a $4.50 a unit offer is inadequate.
A spokeswoman declined to elaborate.
