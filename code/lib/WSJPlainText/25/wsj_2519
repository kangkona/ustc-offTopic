Newbridge Networks Corp. formed a joint venture with the Soviet Ministry of Radio to manufacture the Canadian company's communications-network products. 

The new company, owned 80% by Newbridge and 20% by the Soviet ministry, will have a manufacturing plant in Minsk. 

The joint venture "should act as a gateway to the world's second-largest telecommunications market," said Terence Matthews, Newbridge's chairman.
