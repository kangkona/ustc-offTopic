New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. said it plans to spin off, in a new subsidiary, the $2.2 billion in assets handled by star money manager G. Kenneth Heebner. 

Mr. Heebner and Robert Kemp, president and chief executive officer of New England Mutual's Loomis, Sayles & Co. money-management unit, will take a 25% equity stake in the new subsidiary.
The two also would have an option to buy "at least another 25%," said Mr. Kemp, who will remain at Loomis Sayles until a successor is named. 

Mr. Heebner, who currently directs Loomis Sayles' Capital Growth Management division, would continue to manage most of the half-dozen mutual funds he now runs, as well as his current institutional accounts.
Management of the $63 million New England Equity-Income Fund was handed over to Don Shepherd, a money manager in Loomis Sayles' Pasadena, Calif., office.
Mr. Shepherd also would take over management of the $152 million New England Retirement Equity Fund, Mr. Heebner said. 

Among the several funds Mr. Heebner will keep is New England Zenith Capital Growth, whose 598.7% total return over the past five years is tops among all mutual funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. 

Trustees and shareholders of the several funds that would follow Mr. Heebner must approve the transfer of assets to the new subsidiary.
