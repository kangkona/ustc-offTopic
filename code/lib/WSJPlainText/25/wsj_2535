Raytheon Co., citing higher sales and operating profit in all of its business segments, said earnings rose 8.5% on a 9.8% sales increase for the third quarter ended Oct. 1. 

The electronics and aviation company said earnings rose to $137.4 million, or $2.08 a share, for the quarter, compared with year-earlier profit of $126.7 million, or $1.91 a share.
Sales rose to $2.19 billion from $1.99 billion. 

Raytheon said its backlog was $7.95 billion at the end of the third quarter, down from $8.28 billion a year earlier.
U.S. government funded orders were $5.91 billion at the end of the quarter, compared with $6.14 billion a year ago. 

Raytheon's 1989 results have been aided by foreign tax credits, the company said.
But in the third quarter, total federal and foreign income taxes rose to $59.7 million, compared with $54.7 million a year earlier.
Taxes for the nine months were $170.9 million, compared with $159.7 million last year. 

The company said its defense business was boosted recently by two contracts for electronic counter-measures: a $120.3 million U.S. Air Force contract and a $66.5 million U.S. Navy contract.
Raytheon also was selected to develop a ground-launched version of the Tacit Rainbow missile and to be a secondary contractor on an air-launched version of the missile, the company said. 

Raytheon's Beech Aircraft unit's sales and earnings benefited in the quarter from improved domestic orders for commuter and business turboprop aircraft, the company said.
The appliances unit had strong sales of refrigerators, laundry and environmental products, Raytheon added.
Raytheon didn't disclose details of quarterly performance by sector. 

For the nine months, earnings rose 8.1% to $391.9 million, or $5.94 a share, from $362.3 million, or $5.43 a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose 9.5% to $6.55 billion from $5.98 billion.
