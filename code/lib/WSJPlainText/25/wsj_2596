The Bush administration's "rosy" economic scenario isn't clashing with as many other economists' views these days. 

Blue Chip Economic Indicators of Sedona, Arizona, reported this week that its 53 private economists now predict, on average, that the economy will grow 2.9% this year.
That's exactly what the Bush administration predicted last July -- in a forecast widely criticized as being overly optimistic.
The majority of Blue Chip economists were predicting growth of well below 2.9% at the time. 

The new Blue Chip forecast also shows the administration's optimistic July forecasts for inflation and interest rates this year are now more widely held. 

Administration officials were delighted to find that the recent strength in the economy has convinced other economists to share their optimism. "I'm not saying we're better or worse than the others," said Michael Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. "But we are trying to do a reasonable job here, and these accusations that we're being rosy or overly optimistic are unfounded." The U.S. economy grew at nearly a 3% annual rate in the first half of this year. 

The administration and the private forecasters still don't see eye-to-eye on 1990, however.
The Bush economists predict 2.3% growth and a 6.7% interest rate on three-month Treasury bills; the private economists foresee only 1.8% growth and a 7.3% rate on three-month Treasury bills.
