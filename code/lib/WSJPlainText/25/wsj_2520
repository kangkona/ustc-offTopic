The Agriculture Department boosted its estimates of the nation's 1989 corn and soybean crops and lowered its forecast of how much grain the Soviets will purchase between now and next June 30. 

The department predicted that the U.S. corn harvest will total 7.45 billion bushels, up 2% from last month's forecast and up 51% from the drought-shriveled harvest of 1988.
Department analysts also raised their estimate of the soybean crop 2% above their Sept. 1 forecast -- to 1.93 billion bushels.
That would be 24% above last year's crop. 

Wheat production was forecast at 2.04 billion bushels, down 1% from last month's estimate but up 13% from 1988, according to the department's monthly crop report. 

In a separate report, the department's World Agricultural Outlook Board increased its estimate of the 1989 Soviet grain crop five million tons, to 205 million tons, citing better than anticipated yields in important growing areas in the western Soviet Union and Kazakhstan.
As a result, the board reduced its estimate of Soviet grain imports two million tons to 34 million tons for the marketing year that ends June 30. 

The department's production estimates for corn, soybeans and wheat were seen in Washington as further evidence that U.S. agriculture, despite pockets of severe crop damage last spring and summer, has fully rebounded from the 1988 drought. 

Corn and soybean futures prices are likely to fall, at least initially this morning, and wheat futures prices are likely to rally, based on the crop figures, analysts said. 

The corn crop report exceeded the average of analysts' estimates by about 50 million bushels, said futures analyst Conrad Leslie, head of Leslie Analytical in Chicago.
Analysts' average estimate for the soybean crop was closer to the mark, exceeding the actual figure by only about seven million bushels, he said. 

The wheat crop figure was the biggest surprise, analysts said, being reported as 22 million bushels below the month-earlier Agriculture Department estimate of 2.064 billion bushels.
Analysts said that they were particularly concerned with the estimated wheat stocks, or carryover, available next May 31, which fell 51 million bushels from month-earlier estimates to 443 million bushels, their lowest level in nearly 15 years.
That compares with a carryover of 698 million bushels available this past May 31. 

The department's first forecast for the 1989-1990 orange crop was somewhat gloomy.
It said the harvest would total 194 million boxes, down 6% from last season, mostly because of a killing frost in Florida in late February.
An 11% decline was foreseen for Florida's orange crop. 

Cotton production was forecast at 12 million bales, down 22% from last year and down 2% from the department's Sept. 1 forecast. 

Department analysts predicted a 14% increase in 1989 sorghum production to 657 million bushels, down slightly from last month's estimate.
