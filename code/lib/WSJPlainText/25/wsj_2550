From "Adam Smith's Welfare State," by Adam Meyerson, in the fall issue of Heritage Foundation's Policy Review magazine, which he edits: 

The compassionate populism that drew Smith to capitalism also led him to support government programs that genuinely help people.
Smith did not write in The Wealth of Nations that an "invisible hand" always connects the pursuit of self-interest in the marketplace to the interest of societyonly that it "frequently" does so.
And, despite his suspicion of those clamoring for an expansion of government -- especially for merchants and manufacturers seeking monopoly power through regulation -- he believed government has important responsibilities that the marketplace alone cannot provide for. . . . 

Smith was willing to entertain departures from the marketplace wherever complete economic freedom would lead to human suffering.
Should the abolition of tariffs throw thousands out of work, for example, he wrote that "Humanity may . . . require that the freedom of trade should be restored only by slow gradations, and with a good deal of reserve and circumspection." In most cases, he argued, restrictions on economic freedom cause more suffering than they alleviate; thus price controls on corn convert the inconveniences of a shortage into the miseries of a famine.
But where freedom can genuinely be shown to lead to suffering, he would not dogmatically oppose government intervention.
