Nynex Corp., New York, and two striking unions have agreed to take their labor contract dispute to mediation. 

The Communications Workers of America, which represents about 40,000 employees of the regional telephone company, and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents an additional 20,000, had been seeking agreement on a neutral third party to look at the issues and help resolve the feud.
The unions went on strike Aug. 6. 

The two unions have been negotiating separately, but mediation will be a joint process.
The main dispute in talks with both the IBEW and CWA has been Nynex efforts to shift some health-care costs to employees. 

A CWA spokeswoman said that details haven't yet been worked out. "Who, when and where -- nothing has been decided yet," the spokeswoman said, adding that ground rules haven't been determined either.
