Uranium Resources Inc. said it signed a letter of intent to be acquired by an unidentified public company for $2.55 a share, or between $65 million and $75 million. 

The uranium producer said in Dallas that the purchase price will depend on how the transaction is structured.
The company has 22.7 million primary shares and 31.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
A group of a dozen officers, directors and employees together own 18 million primary shares. 

As part of the agreement, Uranium Resources said it agreed to pay its suitor $2 million plus the suitor's expenses if Uranium Resources agrees to be acquired by another company at a higher price. 

Uranium's shares were quoted yesterday at $2.375 bid, off 12.5 cents, in over-the-counter trading.
