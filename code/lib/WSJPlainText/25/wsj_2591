The Arizona Corporation Commission staff recommended that rates of Southwest Gas Corp. be reduced $7.1 million, a jolt to the Las Vegas-based utility that earlier this year asked for a $47.4 million increase. 

Citing a decline in interest rates, an overly costly pipe replacement program and the borrowing of $58.1 million by the utility to purchase PriMerit Bank, the commission staff called the rate request "unjustified on the basis of the facts that have emerged from our extensive study." 

In filing for the increase, Southwest cited "substantial investments in the operations, upgrading and maintenance" of gas systems in central and southern Arizona. 

A spokesman for Southwest said the utility hadn't yet seen the recommendations and thus couldn't comment.
However, the spokesman said Southwest thinks it has a solid case for the rate increase. 

The commission staff report is expected to be filed today, and hearings are scheduled to begin Nov. 27.
