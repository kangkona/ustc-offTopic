Tyson Foods Inc. said it and a leasing company agreed to sell National By-Products Inc. to a group led by the company's management. 

Terms weren't disclosed.
Tyson, of Springdale, Ark., acquired National By-Products, a meat by-products concern with about $200 million in annual sales, when it purchased Holly Farms Corp. earlier this year. 

Last month, Tyson said it sold 82% of National By-Products and other subsidiaries earmarked for sale to THF Inc., a closely held leasing company, as a way of quickly pulling cash from the units' planned sale. 

A Tyson spokesman said the transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in about a month.
The purchaser, West-End Acquisition Corp., includes 22 officers and employees of National By-Products.
