Rohm & Haas Co. said third-quarter net income skidded 35% to $32.6 million, or 49 cents a share. 

In the year-earlier quarter, the chemicals company had net of $49.8 million, or 75 cents a share. 

Sales were $623 million, up 0.5% from $619.8 million a year ago. 

Rohm & Haas, which plans to start operating seven new production units this year, attributed the profit slide partly to higher start-up expense.
The company also cited the stronger dollar, which cuts the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars. 

In addition, the company said, it was hurt by higher than previous-year costs for raw materials, though those costs have declined since the second quarter.
Incrementally higher production of those chemicals which remain in heavy demand also has forced up costs, such as overtime pay. 

For the nine months, Rohm & Haas net totaled $155 million, or $2.33 a share, down 17% from $187.8 million, or $2.82 a share, a year ago.
Sales rose 5.2% to $2.04 billion from $1.94 billion the previous year. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Rohm & Haas closed at $33 a share, down $1.75.
