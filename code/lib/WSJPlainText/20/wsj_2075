President Bush will veto a bill funding the Departments of Labor, Education and Health and Human Services because it would allow federal funding of abortions for victims of rape and incest, the White House said. 

Mr. Bush had threatened a veto previously.
But he put off a firm decision while his aides and legislators searched for a compromise that would tighten requirements for such abortions in a way acceptable to the president. 

White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said negotiations between Bush aides and lawmakers ended Monday without success.
Most lawmakers think it will be extremely difficult for Mr. Bush's opponents on the abortion issue to round up the votes needed to override the veto.
But there still may be prolonged debate and political maneuvering that holds up the $156.7 billion funding bill for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. 

Mr. Bush has said he personally approves of abortions in the cases of rape, incest and danger to the life of the mother.
But he has opposed Medicaid funding of abortions for poor women who say they are victims of rape and incest, arguing that those exceptions are enforced so loosely that they open the way for abortions for other women.
