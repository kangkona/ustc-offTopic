Great American Bank, citing depressed Arizona real estate prices, posted a third-quarter loss of $59.4 million, or $2.48 a share. 

A year earlier, the savings bank had earnings of $8.1 million, or 33 cents a share.
For the nine months, it had a loss of $58.3 million, or $2.44 a share, after earnings of $29.5 million, or $1.20 a share, in the 1988 period. 

Great American said it increased its loan-loss reserves by $93 million after reviewing its loan portfolio, raising its total loan and real estate reserves to $217 million.
Before the loan-loss addition, it said, it had operating profit of $10 million for the quarter.
The move followed a round of similar increases by other lenders against Arizona real estate loans, reflecting a continuing decline in that market. 

In addition to the increased reserve, the savings bank took a special charge of $5 million representing general and administrative expenses from staff reductions and other matters, and it posted a $7.6 million reduction in expected mortgage servicing fees, reflecting the fact that more borrowers are prepaying their mortgages.
