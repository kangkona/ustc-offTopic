Procter & Gamble Co., Cincinnati, expanding its presence in the food service market, said it acquired Maryland Club Foods, a coffee supplier, from an investor group led by F. Philip Handy of Winter Park, Fla.
Terms weren't disclosed. 

Houston-based Maryland Club Foods, which had sales of about $200 million last year, sells coffee under the Maryland Club and Butter-Nut brands to restaurants, hotels, offices and airlines.
The acquisition "gives us additional production capacity for the food service coffee business and a stronger distribution network," a P&G spokesman said. 

P&G already sells its Folgers ground roast coffee to food service concerns, but not to as many markets as Maryland Club.
For example, P&G up until now hasn't sold coffee to airlines and does only limited business with hotels and large restaurant chains. 

Maryland Club also distributes tea, which fits well with P&G's Tender Leaf brand, and hot cocoa products. 

The company said the acquisition has been completed and reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission.
The purchase includes a coffee-roasting plant in Omaha, Neb., and a leased facility in Houston.
