Parsow Partnership Ltd. and Elkhorn Partners L.P. said they may seek proposals from third parties relating to a sale or restructuring of CACI International Inc. 

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Parsow and Elkhorn, which together hold 8.685% of CACI's common shares, said they think it is in the best interest of CACI stockholders that the company be sold. 

CACI, based in Arlington, Va., said it hadn't seen the filing by Parsow and Elkhorn and therefore had no comment. 

The partnerships said they may seek board representation, and they may seek the support of CACI's board and other major shareholders in connection with their plans. 

According to the filing, Parsow and Elkhorn are based in Elkhorn, Neb., and are controlled by the same general partner, Alan S. Parsow. 

Their combined stake consists of 880,500 CACI common shares, including 86,500 shares bought in the past 60 days at $2.3125 to $2.4375 a share.
Additional shares may be bought or sold in the open market, in private transactions or otherwise, depending on market conditions and other factors.
