Hachette S.A., a European media and publishing group, reported a small rise in its attributable first-half group profit, excluding exceptional items, to 133.8 million francs ($21.1 million) from 130.1 million francs a year earlier. 

The Paris-based group said its earlier projection -- that group profit for all of 1989 would be close to the 322.7 million francs posted for 1988 -- remains valid. 

Taking into account nonrecurring gains and losses, Hachette's group net income for the first six months of this year totaled 246.6 million francs, practically double the year-earlier figure of 124.5 million francs. 

Analysts said Hachette's earnings in the second half might be boosted by a capital gain from the sale of the Paris headquarters of a newspaper-delivery company that is 49% owned by Hachette.
