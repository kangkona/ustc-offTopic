UAL, the hair-trigger stock that exploded Friday's market bombshell, briefly traumatized traders again yesterday. 

Within 10 minutes after an 11:13 a.m. trading halt in UAL, parent of United Airlines, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 27 points to a 60.25-point deficit.
Computer-guided buying then kicked in, and the industrials regained 27 points in five minutes. 

The lightning moves show that the stock market remains fragile and volatile -- ready to jump at the slightest rumor -- a few days after its shocking 190.58-point plunge.
Nervous investors continued to limit their buying to blue-chip stocks while dumping takeover-related issues. 

The industrial average closed down 18.65, to 2638.73.
New York Stock Exchange volume was a heavy 224,070,000 shares.
Decliners on the Big Board outnumbered advancers, 931 to 658. 

UAL was watched closely and traded heavily.
The stock tumbled 24 7/8 to 198 on volume of 2.8 million shares. 

The market is still very touchy about rumors and news on pending takeovers.
UAL, which is trying to reconstruct a buy-out bid that banks wouldn't finance, represents the future of one of the most powerful ingredients in the bull market-corporate restructuring.
An important element of this phenomenon -- the now-shaky market for junk bonds, used often to finance restructurings and takeovers -- continued to cast a pall over stocks. 

"It was a very nervous day," said John Geary, partner of the Big Board specialist firm Ziebarth, Geary. 

The volatility won't end soon.
This Friday brings the "double witching hour," Wall Street's nickname for the monthly simultaneous expiration of a variety of stock index futures, index options and options on individual stocks.
Traders are already buckling their seat belts.
Previous monthly expirations of the Major Market Index futures and Standard & Poor's 100-stock index options have produced spectacular volatility. 

"We are in one of those phases where you are going to get a lot of volatile expiration action," said Donald Selkin, head of stock-index research at Prudential-Bache Securities. 

Investors were buying yesterday, but they were running scared to premier blue chips such as Procter & Gamble, which jumped 3 3/8 to 127.
Investors "are buying stocks that have predictable earnings," said Edward J. Laux, head of block trading at Kidder Peabody. 

Along the way, investors dumped takeover stocks and shares of banks that have leveraged-buy-out debt and risky real estate loans on their books. 

"These loans are more of a focus than lesser-developed-country debt now," said William Bee, senior block trader at Prudential-Bache Securities. 

Chase Manhattan, which sold 14 million additional shares at 40 1/8 Monday through an underwriting group led by Goldman Sachs, closed down 1/8 to 40.
Citicorp fell 1/2 to 32, and Manufacturers Hanover slipped 3/8 to 40 1/4.
Chase and Citicorp's Citibank are involved in the UAL buy-out financing.
Both Citicorp and Manufacturers Hanover reported earnings yesterday. 

In the first hour of trading, about one million shares a minute changed hands on the Big Board as big stock-index arbitrage sell programs pushed prices lower. (In stock-index arbitrage, traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks against offsetting positions in futures.) Traders said many of the sell programs are positions being established ahead of this Friday's expiration. 

Aside from computer-guided selling, airline stocks took a beating as well.
The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 49.96 to close at 1254.27.
AMR, the parent of American Airlines, continued to retreat in the wake of New York developer Donald Trump's decision to withdraw his $120-a-share takeover bid.
The stock fell 3 1/4 to 73 1/4 on 3.4 million shares.
Delta Air Lines fell 1 7/8 to 67 7/8, USAir Group dropped 3/4 to 40 1/4, Southwest Airlines dipped 1/2 to 25 and Alaska Air Group slid 3/8 to 24 1/4. 

But Texas Air, the owner of Continental and Eastern airlines, bucked the group's decline by rising 7/8 to 14 5/8 in American Stock Exchange trading.
Eastern said it is ahead of schedule in resuming its operations after filing earlier this year for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, from which it expects to emerge early next year. 

Philip Morris, the most active Big Board issue for the second consecutive session, was unchanged at 43 1/4 on 3.9 million shares.
Other blue-chip consumer issues also fared relatively well: PepsiCo rose 1 3/8 to 58 1/2; Coca-Cola Co. was unchanged at 66 3/4; McDonald's also closed unchanged at 30 1/2, and Merck rose 1/2 to 75 1/4. 

Broader averages also fell.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.69 to 341.16, and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 0.88 to 188.89. 

Among the takeover-related stocks that sold off yesterday were Disney, which closed down 2 1/8 to 121 1/4.
Philips Industries tumbled 3/8 to 22 7/8; Hilton Hotels fell 2 1/2 to 92 and Holiday Corp. fell 2 1/8 to 69 7/8. 

Among other blue chips, Exxon gained 1/8 to 45 1/2.
International Paper fell 1 3/8 to 51 1/2, Union Carbide eased 7/8 to 25, Chevron gained 1/8 to 64, and Eastman Kodak closed down 3/4 to 44 1/4. 

The only industry group to show a gain from the industrial average's record high on Oct. 9 is restaurants.
Among the three worst-performing groups, with declines of 10% to 20%, are airlines, casinos and securities brokers. 

Trading also was heavy in the over-the-counter market.
The Nasdaq composite index closed down 1.05 to 459.93 on volume of 161.5 million shares. "The environment is a lot more trading-oriented," said Gary Rosenbach, manager of equity trading at the OTC stock firm Needham & Co. in New York. "Because there is a lot more volatility now, if guys see that they can make a quick 10% or 15% profit, they'll take it." 

Compaq Computer gained 2 1/8 to 103 3/4 on two million shares, reflecting market optimism about the prospects for its newly introduced notebook-sized computer. 

B.F. Goodrich dropped 1 3/8 to 49 1/8.
The company's third-quarter earnings were below both analysts' forecasts and the year-earlier level. 

Blue Arrow added 1/2 to 17 1/4.
The British company plans to change its name to Manpower, the name of its U.S. unit, and write off part of nearly $1.2 billion in good will as a possible prelude to reincorporating in the U.S. 

Dravo rose 5/8 to 16 1/8.
Shearson Lehman Hutton began its coverage of the company with favorable ratings. 

Intertan jumped 2 1/4 to 56 7/8.
The company reported that earnings from operations for the September quarter were up about 25% from a year earlier. 

Bay Financial, which said it may be forced to file under Chapter 11 if it can't reach an agreement with its lenders to relieve its debt burden, plunged 1 3/8 to 2 1/8. 

The Amex Market Value Index fell 1.25 to 375.16.
Volume totaled 16,800,000 shares. 

Among active Amex issues, the American depositary receipts of B.A.T Industries fell 1/4 to 11 3/4 on turnover of 885,800.
Investment bankers and retailers said the turmoil on Wall Street may benefit managers who plan to bid for U.S. retailing units of the British firm because takeover prices may not be as high as before the recent correction. 

Fruit of the Loom slipped 1/8 to 12 3/8 on 501,200 shares.
DWG Corp. jumped 1 1/4 to 15 on 454,100 shares.
Carnival Cruise Lines Class A dropped 1 to 21 1/8 on 331,400 shares. 

Amex issues with big percentage price gains included two Eastern Air Lines preferred stocks, reacting to the news about improved recovery in flight schedules after the company filed for bankruptcy protection.
Eastern's Class F preferred rose 12%, or 1 1/4, to 11 3/4; the Class E preferred gained 7%, or 5/8, to 10 1/4. 

The biggest percentage gainer on the Amex was Enviropact, which jumped 23%, or 5/8, to 3 3/8 on volume of 29,000 shares.
On Monday, the company, a provider of environmental consulting services, reported a wider fiscal fourth-quarter loss and predicted a loss for its fiscal 1990 first quarter, but said a profit is expected for all of fiscal 1990.
But its auditor, Ernst & Young, said Enviropact's financial situation raises "substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern." Mission Resource Partners advanced 8%, or 1 3/8, to 18 7/8.
