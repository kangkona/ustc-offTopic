BroadBeach Associates Inc., the Los Angeles investment partnership whose $62-a-share bid for McGill Manufacturing Co. was topped recently by a competing offer from a Swedish concern, disclosed that it sold its entire 7% McGill stake. 

McGill, a Valparaiso, Ind., ball-bearing manufacturer, had rebuffed BroadBeach's proposal.
It has since asked holders not to immediately tender their shares under a recent $72-a-share, or $104 million, bid from AB SKF of Sweden, until McGill directors have completed their evaluation. 

In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, BroadBeach said it sold the 101,000 McGill shares for $7.3 million in a private transaction on Oct. 12.
BroadBeach didn't identify the buyer of the shares, but the date of the selloff followed by one day the Swedish concern's tender offer, and the indicated price of the shares sold equals SKF's $72-a-share tender offer price. 

A BroadBeach spokeswoman said the company sold the stock in the open market and thus couldn't identify the buyer or buyers.
