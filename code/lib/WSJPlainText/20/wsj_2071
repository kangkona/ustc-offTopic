National Semiconductor Corp. said it settled a four-year-old patent infringement case against Linear Technology Corp. by accepting a $3 million payment from Linear in exchange for granting Linear irrevocable licenses for all products involved.
The two companies also agreed to settle any future property rights issues over the next 10 years through binding arbitration, both companies said. 

The products are so-called analog integrated circuits that have applications in the consumer electronics, automobile and electronic instrumentation markets.
Linear Technology, Milpitas, Calif., called the settlement "positive," since products covered by the disputed patents account for about 20% of its annual sales. 

The electronics concern said it already has paid $2 million of the settlement to National Semiconductor, Santa Clara, Calif., and will pay the remaining $1 million in equal installments over the next eight quarters.
The payments aren't expected to have an impact on coming operating results, Linear added.
