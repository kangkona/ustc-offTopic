The federal government should make free, voluntary testing for the AIDS virus the cornerstone of an expanded campaign to stop the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the Hudson Institute recommended. 

"By encouraging massive, routine, voluntary testing we can enable society to voluntarily segregate itself sexually into two groups: those who carry the virus and those who do not," the Indianapolis research organization said in a new report. 

The report takes a more alarmed view of AIDS and recommends a more sweeping response than many other analyses.
It warns that the AIDS epidemic "may reduce the rate of growth of the work force, curb productivity gains and slow economic growth." 

It contends that current government policy is failing to stem the AIDS epidemic because it suggests the use of condoms can make sex "safe." But the report says: "The only safe sex is sex between uninfected partners," and testing is the only way to learn of infection. 

Hudson's researchers estimated that it would cost less than $650 million a year to test the entire population between the ages of 12 and 65 years old.
In addition, the report recommends that federal and state governments provide free treatment to all who test positive.
