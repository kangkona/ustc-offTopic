Fiat S.p.
A., Italy's leading industrial group, is conducting "concrete" talks with West Germany's Daimler-Benz AG on a series of projects in the aerospace sector, Fiat officials said. 

However, the officials said it was too early to disclose the nature of the proposed projects or indicate when the talks might be concluded. 

Daimler-Benz Chairman Edzard Reuter told Milan's financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore that talks are taking place between both companies' aerospace units. 

"While Mr. Reuter's comments please us very much, there currently are no talks in progress regarding the automotive industry," a Fiat spokeswoman said. 

In the interview, Mr. Reuter said he is thinking foremost of cooperation in the truck sector, but "in the long run, I don't want to rule out that we can also come a bit closer in personal cars." 

Roberto Morelli, Italy analyst for County Natwest Securities in London, said that right now "the market isn't being influenced by that kind of news," referring to the conditional nature of the talks mentioned by Mr. Reuter and by the uncertainty surrounding world stock exchanges this week.
