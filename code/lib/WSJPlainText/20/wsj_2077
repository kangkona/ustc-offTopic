J.P. Morgan & Co., New York, will help the statutory managers of DFC New Zealand Ltd. to evaluate the failed investment bank's condition. 

Earlier this month, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the country's central bank, appointed the managers to run the investment bank and pay creditors.
DFC asked the central bank to appoint managers after it revised loan-loss provisions to around the same level of shareholders' funds of 180 million New Zealand dollars (US$105.4 million). 

DFC is held 80% by National Provident Fund, New Zealand's largest pension fund, and 20% by Salomon Brothers Inc., the investment-bank and securities-firm subsidiary of Salomon Inc. in New York. 

A spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan, parent of the bank Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., confirmed its appointment to assist the managers but declined to elaborate. 

The managers said in a brief statement yesterday that Morgan will help evaluate DFC's position and help determine alternatives.
The managers don't expect to complete the evaluation until Nov. 30.
