Boeing Co., already struck by its Machinists union, briefly called off contract talks with its engineers and labeled their demands "grossly excessive." 

Later, however, the company agreed to meet on Monday with the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Association after a federal mediator intervened, according to the union. 

A spokesman for the engineers said the company asked the union to reduce its demands, which included a 19% pay hike in the first year and 8% in the second and third years.
The union represents about 28,000 engineers and technical workers.
Its contract expires Dec. 1. 

Meanwhile, a federal mediator is scheduled to meet today with Boeing officials and representatives of 55,000 striking Machinists. 

"It will take several meetings to resolve this," said a spokesman for the Machinists union. "We don't want to bring back something the members will reject." Machinists already have rejected a package that would have provided a 10% pay raise plus bonuses over the three-year life of the contract.
It also would have reduced mandatory overtime.
