ONE LIBERTY PROPERTIES Inc. declared a dividend of 40 cents a share on its $16.50 cumulative convertible preferred stock, payable Jan. 2 to stock of record Dec. 8.
But directors of the Great Neck, N.Y., real estate investment trust didn't act on the common stock dividend.
And they won't consider such a dividend, the trust added, before results are available for the first quarter of 1990.
In part, the trust cited the need to retain cash for possible acquisitions.
According to a spokesman, One Liberty will have paid out as dividends the required amount of its taxable income to maintain its legal status as a real estate investment trust.
