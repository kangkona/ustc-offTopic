This is written to correct a misquotation in your Oct. 3 article "Deaths From Advanced Colon Cancer Can Be Reduced by Using Two Drugs." In this article, I was alleged to have said, "Any patient with high-risk colon cancer is really getting short shrift if he's not getting this therapy." 

I didn't say this, and I'm totally opposed to the philosophy expressed by the quote.
I have not offered and will not offer routine therapy with the two drugs, levamisole and 5-fluorouracil, to any of my colon-cancer patients.
With this treatment we have reduced deaths in high-risk colon cancer by one-third -- but this leaves the two-thirds who are dying of cancer.
This is not nearly good enough.
I believe any physician who truly cares about cancer patients, both today and tomorrow, should offer the hope of something better than that.
My statement, read verbatim from a printed text available to all reporters attending the National Cancer Institute news conference, was the following: "New clinical trials are already in operation seeking to improve these results.
These research protocols offer to the patient not only the very best therapy which we have established today but also the hope of something still better.
I feel any patient with high-risk cancer is getting short shrift if he is not offered this opportunity." 

We have very exciting prospects for far more impressive advances in the treatment of colon cancer during the years immediately ahead.
This hope, however, will never be realized if we use levamisole and 5-fluorouracil as a stopping point.
