An experimental vaccine can alter the immune response of people infected with the AIDS virus, a prominent U.S. scientist said. 

However, that doesn't mean they can benefit from the vaccine.
Its effectiveness can't be determined until a large clinical trial is undertaken by the Army in January, according to Robert Redfield, chief of acquired immune deficiency syndrome research at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. 

Dr. Redfield's report on early experiments using an AIDS vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of West Haven, Conn., came at a meeting of AIDS vaccine researchers in Florida late Monday.
The vaccine, VaxSyn HIV-1, has been safely given to 14 people, some of whom are experiencing substantial increases in certain antibodies. 

"The conventional wisdom used to be that you couldn't modify the immune response of an infected individual" by innoculating them with synthetic viral proteins, Dr. Redfield said. "We've demonstrated that you can." 

He said certain volunteers developed kinds of antibodies associated with early AIDS. Other antibodies sparked by the preparation are of a sort rarely present in large quantities in infected or ill individuals, he added.
One of the mysteries of AIDS remains why infected people produce large quantities of antibodies, but deteriorate nonetheless.
