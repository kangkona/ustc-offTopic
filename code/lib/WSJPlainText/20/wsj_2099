Unilab Corp., Norcross, Ga., said it acquired the clinical laboratories of closely held Central Diagnostic Laboratory Inc. in a cash and securities transaction valued at $85 million. 

Unilab said its wholly owned MetWest Inc. unit paid $25 million in cash, provided $30 million in notes and $30 million in preferred stock to acquire Central's labs in the Western U.S. 

Unilab, which provides clinical laboratory services, competed with Central, based in Tarzana, Calif., in a number of areas.
Beyond removing a competitor, the combination should provide "synergies," said Fred Harlow, Unilab's chief financial officer.
It also will hand Unilab new markets.
In Los Angeles, for example, Central has had a strong market position while Unilab's presence has been less prominent, according to Mr. Harlow.
