Newport Electronics Inc. of Santa Ana, Calif., said Milton B. Hollander, who holds a 49.4% stake, requested a special shareholders' meeting next Wednesday to remove four current directors and elect an alternative slate. 

Mr. Hollander's High Technology Holding Co. of Stamford, Conn., acquired most of its stake last August in an $11-a-share tender offer for Newport, a maker of electronic-measuring devices. 

Newport said Mr. Hollander is asking shareholders to retain only one director, James R. Lees, a Newport vice president.
The board isn't proposing a slate of its own and the other four current directors don't want to serve beyond the special meeting date, Newport said. 

Mr. Hollander "is the new owner and wants to exercise control," said Barret B. Weekes, Newport's chairman.
