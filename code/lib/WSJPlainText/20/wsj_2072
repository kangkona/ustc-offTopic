NBC's winning streak has been canceled. 

The National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co., had its record-breaking 68-week reign as the prime-time ratings leader snapped yesterday by ABC-TV, a subsidiary of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
In the ratings compiled by the A.C. Nielsen Co., ABC, which broadcast the World Series, topped the competition with a 14.8 rating and 25 share. 

NBC was second with a 13.9 rating and 24 share followed by CBS Inc. 's television network with a 12.5 rating and 21 share. (A ratings point represents 904,000 television households; shares indicate the percentage of sets in use.) 

The first two games of the World Series between the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants didn't finish in the top 10; instead they landed in 16th and 18th place.
The highest-rated show continues to be ABC's "Roseanne." NBC had five of the top 10 shows; ABC had four and CBS had one. 

CBS held the previous record for consecutive No. 1 victories -- 46 weeks -- during the 1962-63 season.
