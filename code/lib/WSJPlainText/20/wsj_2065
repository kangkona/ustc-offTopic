The Chicago Mercantile Exchange fined and suspended two commodities traders accused of making prearranged trades with each other that allegedly cheated a customer. 

Merc officials said Gary N. Roberts was disciplined following the exchange's investigation of his trading in several commodities pits from July to November 1988.
The Merc said Mr. Roberts withheld from the market certain orders in cooperation with another trader, David Stein. 

The Merc fined Mr. Roberts $15,000 and suspended his trading membership for three years.
Also, he and Mr. Stein were ordered to make restitution of $35,000 to a customer. 

Mr. Stein was fined $25,000 and suspended for three years. 

Messrs.
Roberts and Stein couldn't be reached for comment.
The Merc said that as part of the disciplinary settlement, neither man admitted, nor denied the alleged violations.
Neither was among the 46 traders indicted last August in a federal investigation of traders at both the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade.
