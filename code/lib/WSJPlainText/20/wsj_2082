Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.) said he and Rep. Byron Dorgan (D., N.D.) are backing away from their proposal to make the Treasury Secretary a voting member of the Federal Reserve panel that sets monetary policy. 

Rep. Hamilton said the bill will be modified substantially to call for two meetings each year between the Fed's open market committee and the Treasury Secretary, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and the director of the Office of Management and Budget. 

The original bill was strongly opposed by the Fed and publicly criticized by friends of the Fed as an attempt to undermine the central bank's independence.
Fed critics, however, hailed it as a long overdue attempt to bring a measure of openness and democracy to the setting of monetary policy. 

Rep. Hamilton said the purpose of the meetings would be to "improve communications and perhaps coordination between the executive branch and the Fed." 

Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan meets regularly for lunch with Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and talks frequently with Budget Director Richard Darman and Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
The administration officials don't ordinarily meet with the entire membership of the open market committee.
