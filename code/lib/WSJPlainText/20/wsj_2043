The inverse trading relationship between bonds and stocks was interrupted yesterday as bonds fell despite a modest decline in stock prices. 

But bond investors continue to keep a close watch on the jittery stock market.
In early trading, investors were bidding bond prices higher as stocks tumbled and fears mounted that Friday's stock market debacle would be repeated. 

But a partial recovery in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been down more than 60 points in midmorning, dashed those expectations.
Treasury bonds also were hurt late in the day by a $4 billion offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority and the prospect of a huge amount of new agency debt. 

"Bond investors were hoping that stock prices would continue to fall," said Roger Early, a vice president at Federated Investors Inc., Pittsburgh. "When stocks stabilized, that was a disappointment." 

Meanwhile, for the second straight day, the bond market paid little attention to the Federal Reserve's open market operations.
Fed officials injected more cash into the banking system by arranging $1.5 billion of repurchase agreements during the usual pre-noon intervention period.
The move was meant to keep a lid on interest rates and to boost investor confidence. 

"The intervention has been friendly, meaning that they really didn't have to do it," said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, money-market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
She said a more aggressive move wasn't needed. 

The Fed also appears reluctant to ease credit conditions further.
It already has allowed the closely watched federal funds rate to decline 1/4 percentage point to about 8 3/4% from its previous target level of about 9%.
The rate, which banks charge each other on overnight loans, is considered an early signal of changes in Fed policy.
It ended at about 8 11/16% yesterday, but was as low as 8 1/2% Monday. 

The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell more than 1/2 point, or over $5 for each $1,000 face amount, while the yield moved above 8% for the first time since Thursday.
Investment-grade corporate, municipal and mortgage-backed securities also fell. 

But most junk bonds closed unchanged after opening slightly higher on bargain-hunting by institutional investors.
Some so-called high-quality junk issues, such as R.H. Macy & Co. 's 14 1/2% subordinated debentures, rose.
The Macy's issue closed up about one point at a bid price of 97. 

The TVA's public debt offering was its first in 15 years.
Strong investor demand prompted it to boost the size of the issue from $3 billion. 

Traders said hedging related to the TVA pricing also pressured Treasury bonds. "Underwriters of the TVA bonds reduced their market risk by selling Treasurys to cover at least part of their {TVA} holdings," said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. 

The TVA bonds also "served to remind the market that there will be even more new supply," said Lawrence N. Leuzzi, a managing director at S.G. Warburg Securities & Co. 

Today the Treasury will announce the size of its next two-year note sale and Resolution Funding Corp. will announce details of its first bond offering.
Some traders estimate $9.75 billion of new two-year Treasurys will be sold next week, and they expect Refcorp to offer $4 billion to $6 billion of long-term "bailout" bonds.
Refcorp was created to help fund the thrift bailout. 

Another agency issue came to market yesterday.
The Office of Finance of the Federal Home Loan Banks said it priced a four-part $2.27 billion bond offering for the banks to yield from 8.125% to 8.375%. 

The release of several economic reports had little impact on the market, including a report that the U.S. trade deficit expanded to a surprisingly wide $10.77 billion in August, up from a revised $8.24 billion in July.
The August gap was expected to have expanded to $9.1 billion. 

Treasury Securities 

Treasury securities were essentially flat to about 1/2 point lower. 

The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at 100 28/32 to yield 8.04%, compared with 101 19/32 to yield 7.97% Monday.
The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 99 25/32 to yield 8.01%, compared with 100 1/32 to yield 7.97%. 

Short-term rates increased.
The discount rate on three-month bills rose to 7.52% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.75%.
The rate on six-month bills rose to 7.53% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.92%. 

Corporate, Other Issues 

Investment-grade corporate bonds ended 1/4 to 1/2 point lower, while most junk bonds ended unchanged. 

The TVA's huge $4 billion offering dominated attention in the new-issue market.
TVA offered $2 billion of 30-year bonds priced to yield 9.06%; $1 billion in 10-year notes priced to yield 8.42%; and $1 billion in five-year notes priced to yield 8.33%. 

The TVA, which operates one of the nation's largest electric power systems, is a corporation wholly owned by the U.S. government.
Yesterday's bond sale was part of a $6.7 billion refinancing plan to pay off high-interest debt the TVA owes the Federal Financing Bank, an arm of the Treasury. 

Meanwhile, Lockheed Corp. priced a $300 million note offering to yield 9.39%. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities 

The derivative mortgage-backed market revived after a brief hiatus as two new Remics totaling $850 million were offered and talk circulated about two more issues that could be priced today. 

The revival of the real estate mortgage investment conduit market reflected the relative calm in the mortgage market after two days of volatile trading.
Dealers noted that it's difficult to structure new Remics when prices are moving widely. 

The two Remics priced were a $500 million Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. issue underwritten by Salomon Brothers Inc. and a $350 million Federal National Mortgage Association deal underwritten by Greenwich Capital Markets. 

The Remic issuance supported prices of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae securities, which held up better than Government National Mortgage Association securities during an afternoon sell-off. 

Ginnie Mae 9% securities for November delivery ended at 97 29/32, down 7/32; 9 1/2% securities at 99 31/32, down 6/32; and 10% securities at 101 29/32, down 5/32.
Freddie Mac 9% securities were at 97 5/32, down 3/32. 

The Ginnie Mae 9% issue was yielding 9.43% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note held at 1.42 percentage points. 

Municipals 

Confusion over the near-term trend for rates dominated the municipal arena, as gyrations in the stock market continued to buffet bonds. 

Long tax-exempt dollar bonds were mostly flat to 3/8 point lower after a whipsaw session of moving inversely to stocks in modest dealer-led trading. 

Prices of pre-refunded municipal bonds were capped by news that Chemical Securities Inc., as agent for a customer, will accept bids today for two large lists of bonds that include many such issues.
The lists total $654.5 million.
Pre-refunded bonds are called at their earliest call date with the escrowed proceeds of another bond issue. 

Meanwhile, several new issues were priced. 

Underwriters led by PaineWebber Inc. set preliminary pricing for $144.4 million of California Health Facilities Financing Authority revenue bonds for Kaiser Permanente.
Tentative reoffering yields were set from 6.25% in 1993 to 7.227% in 2018. 

As part of its College Savings Plan, Connecticut offered $100.4 million of general obligation capital appreciation bonds priced to yield to maturity from 6.25% in 1994 to 6.90% in 2006, 2007 and 2009. 

A Chemical Securities group won a $100 million Oregon general obligation veterans' tax note issue due Nov. 1, 1990.
The 6 3/4% notes yield 6.25%. 

Foreign Bonds 

West German government bond prices took a wild roller-coaster ride, pulled down by Monday's U.S. stock market gains then up by a wider-than-expected U.S. trade deficit and falling U.S. stock prices. 

West Germany's 7% bond due October 1999 was at 99.95 late yesterday, off 0.10 point from Monday, to yield 7.01%.
The 6 3/4% notes due April 1994 were up 0.10 point to 97.85 to yield 7.31%. 

British government bonds surged on renewed volatility in the stock market.
The Treasury 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 rose 23/32 to 112 10/32 to yield 10.03%. 

But Japanese bonds ended weaker.
The benchmark No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers' screens at a price of 96, off 0.15 point to yield 5.27%.
