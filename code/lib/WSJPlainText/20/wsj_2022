Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., fulfilling its dismal earnings forecast for 1989, said its third-quarter net income fell 68% on flat revenue. 

Stung by higher marketing costs and slowing volume growth, the giant Coke bottling operation said net fell to $12.7 million, or six cents a share, from $39.9 million, or 26 cents a share, the year earlier.
The results met estimates of analysts, who had already slashed their projections after the company said in late August that its 1989 earnings could tumble as much as 37%.
A company spokesman said yesterday that Coca-Cola Enterprises sticks by its 1989 forecast. 

Third-quarter revenue was flat at $1.02 billion.
The year-ago results, however, included the operations of a bottling business, which was sold last December. 

Excluding that bottling business, Coca-Cola Enterprises' volume, measured by cases of soda, rose only 1%.
The volume is well below the industry's 4% to 5% growth rate of recent years, but in line with other soft-drink companies for the third quarter.
The latest third-quarter volume also compares with a very strong 10% growth in the year-ago quarter. 

Coca-Cola Enterprises blamed the lower volume on its soft-drink prices, which were about 3% higher in the third quarter.
Consumers have been accustomed to buying soft-drinks at discounted prices for several years.
Coca-Cola Enterprises said it had to boost spending for trade and dealer incentives to try to keep volumes from slipping.
The company said it expects consumers will adjust to higher-priced soft drinks. 

A spokesman attributed the bulk of a 14% increase in selling, administrative and general expenses -- to $324.9 million -- to marketing costs. "They're out there promoting like crazy, trying to get prices up by promotion," said Roy Burry, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Co. 

For the nine months, Coca-Cola Enterprises' net fell 31% to $65 million, or 39 cents a share, from $93.8 million, or 63 cents a share.
Revenue was flat at about $2.97 billion. 

Coca-Cola Enterprises, which is 49%-owned by Coca-Cola Co., also said it repurchased about 1.2 million of its common shares during the third quarter.
The buy-back is part of a 25-million-share repurchase plan, under which Coca-Cola Enterprises so far has acquired a total of 9.7 million shares. 

Separately, Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo Inc., as expected, said fiscal third-quarter net rose 11% to $269.3 million, or $1.02 a share, from $241.6 million, or 91 cents a share.
Sales rose 25% to $3.90 billion from $3.13 billion.
The year-ago quarter's results include an after-tax charge of $5.9 million from the sale of a winery in Spain. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Coca-Cola Enterprises closed at $16.375 a share, down 62.5 cents.
PepsiCo closed at $58.50 a share, up $1.375.
