Weyerhaeuser Co. reported a one-time gain and strong wood-product sales that offset weakness in pulp and paper to fuel a 15% jump in third-quarter net income to $166.8 million, or 78 cents a share. 

In the 1988 third quarter, the forest-products company reported profit of $144.9 million, or 69 cents a share. 

Sales rose 9% to $2.57 billion from $2.36 billion. 

For the nine months, the company posted a 14% rise in profit to $469.8 million, or $2.21 a share, from $410.3 million, or $1.95 a share.
Sales rose 9% to $7.54 billion from $6.95 billion. 

Results for the 1989 third quarter and nine months include a pretax loss of $33 million from the company's business improvement and refocusing program, and a gain of $49 million on the sale of a subsidiary's common stock. 

Forest-products operations strengthened in the third quarter, while paper operations were dogged by higher costs, soft newsprint exports and a strong Japanese yen.
Some competing forest-products firms have recently reported improved results due to strong pulp and paper business.
Weyerhaeuser's pulp and paper operations were up for the nine months, but full-year performance depends on the balance of operating and maintenance costs, plus pricing of certain products, the company said. 

Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the company said export log and lumber markets will be weak, while panel and plywood markets will be stronger.
Pulp and paper performance depends on cost and price variables, the company said.
