Investor Asher Edelman increased his stake in Intelogic Trace Inc. and cleared the way for additional purchases. 

It wasn't clear, however, whether the actions were related to a battle between the corporate raider and New York attorney Martin Ackerman for control of Datapoint Corp., a San Antonio, Texas-based data-processing systems maker. 

Intelogic Trace, a computer services company, was spun off to Datapoint holders in 1985, after Mr. Edelman gained control.
After Mr. Ackerman announced he was soliciting consents from shareholders in order to wrest control of Datapoint from Mr. Edelman, the corporate raider purchased 30% of Datapoint's shares. 

In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Edelman said from Sept. 29 to Oct. 13, he acquired 309,500 shares of Intelogic common shares for $2.25 to $2.375 each.
The purchases increased his stake to 16.2% of the shares outstanding. 

The filing also said certain provisions which apply to persons acquiring 20% or more of Intelogic common stock, were waived by Intelogic for Mr. Edelman, who is chairman of the company.
Mr. Edelman couldn't be reached for comment.
