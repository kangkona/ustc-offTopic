Matra S.A. reported its 1989 first-half profit soared 88%, and indicated that its previous estimate of a 50% rise in earnings for all of 1989 will be exceeded by a wide margin. 

The French electronics and defense group said attributable consolidated net profit for the first six months of 1989 totaled 244 million francs ($38.4 million), compared with 130 million francs ($20.5 million) in the corresponding period of 

Operating profit climbed 51%, to 572 million francs from 378 million in the first half of 1988. 

Matra said the sharp improvement in net profit partly reflected a decline of 59 million francs in the group's net loss from nonrecurring items in the first half of this year to 104 million francs from 163 million a year earlier.
There was also a decline in the group's net financial costs to 25 million francs from 50 million a year before. 

These movements were offset, however, by a steep rise in corporate income tax payments to 199 million francs from 35 million in the first six months of 1988. 

Matra said the sharp rise in its first-half earnings was based on a 15% gain in consolidated revenue to 10.16 billion francs from 8.85 billion a year earlier.
