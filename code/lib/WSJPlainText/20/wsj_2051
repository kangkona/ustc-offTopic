Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered ratings on about $650 million of Beatrice Co. debt, citing the closely held Chicago food concern's proposed recapitalization. 

The ratings concern said it downgraded Beatrice notes, Euronotes and certain industrial revenue bonds to single-B-1 from Ba-3 and the company's subordinated debentures to single-B-3 from single-B-2. 

Moody's said the proposed recaptilization may "limit the company's ability to realize its profit potential" and that paying dividends from a new series of preferred could squeeze "basic business operations." A Beatrice spokesman didn't return calls seeking comment. 

Beatrice, which went private in an $8.2 billion leveraged buy-out in 1986, said last month that it might borrow again to help pay investors as much as $983 million in preferred stock and debt securities.
