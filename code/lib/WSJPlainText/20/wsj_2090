Amstrad PLC, a British maker of computer hardware and communications equipment, posted a 52% plunge in pretax profit for the latest year. 

The #76.6 million ($120.6 million) in pretax profit for the 12 months to June 30 was down from #160 million ($252 million) a year earlier and below market expectations of #80 million and #90 million. 

The slump in profit, which came despite steady sales, was attributed to increased costs for parts and problems with model introductions. 

Amstrad's profit after taxes fell a similarly steep 51%, to #51.1 million from #105 million a year earlier. 

Sales edged up fractionally to #626.3 million from #625.4 million a year earlier.
