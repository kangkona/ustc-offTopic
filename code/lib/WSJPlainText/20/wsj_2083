B.F. Goodrich Co. said third-quarter profits dropped 34% because of lower prices for polyvinyl chloride materials, the company's largest product group. 

Net fell to $40.1 million, or $1.50 a share, from $60.7 million, or $2.32 a share, a year earlier.
Sales for the quarter slipped 2.7% to $601.3 million from $618.1 million. 

Polyvinyl chloride capacity "has overtaken demand and we are experiencing reduced profit margins as a result," said John D. Ong, chairman and chief executive.
Prices for general-purpose PVC resin have dropped more than 15% since last December, he said.
The plastic resin is used in a wide range of products, including siding, pipe and electrical wire insulation. 

Goodrich's vinyl-products segment reported operating profit for the quarter of $30.1 million, less than half the $64.1 million of the year-earlier quarter.
Third-quarter operating profit of the specialty-chemicals group declined slightly to $24.3 million from $24.9 million.
But operating profit from aerospace products rose nearly 50% to $15 million from $10.1 million. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, shares of the Akron, Ohio-based company fell $1.375 to $49.125.
