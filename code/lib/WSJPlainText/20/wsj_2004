Arbitragers weren't the only big losers in the collapse of UAL Corp. stock.
Look at what happened to UAL's chairman, Stephen M. Wolf, and its chief financial officer, John C. Pope. 

On a day some United Airlines employees wanted Mr. Wolf fired and takeover stock speculators wanted his scalp, Messrs.
Wolf and Pope saw their prospective personal fortunes continue to plummet as shares of UAL, United's parent company, dived $24.875 on the Big Board to close at $198. 

Including Monday's plunge, that has given the two executives paper losses of $49.5 million, based on what they would have realized had the pilots and management-led buy-out of UAL gone through at $300 a share. 

When bank financing for the buy-out collapsed last week, so did UAL's stock.
Even if the banks resurrect a financing package at $250 a share, the two executives would still get about $25 million less than they stood to gain in the initial transaction. 

Mr. Wolf owns 75,000 UAL shares and has options to buy another 250,000 at $83.3125 each.
In the $300-a-share buyout, that totaled about $76.7 million.
By yesterday's close of trading, it was good for a paltry $43.5 million. 

Of course, Mr. Wolf, 48 years old, has some savings.
He left his last two jobs at Republic Airlines and Flying Tiger with combined stock-option gains of about $22 million, and UAL gave him a $15 million bonus when it hired him.
His 1988 salary was $575,000, with a $575,000 bonus. 

The 40-year old Mr. Pope hasn't changed jobs enough -- at least the right ones -- to stash away that kind of money.
United paid him a $375,000 bonus to lure him away from American Airlines, and he was paid a salary of $342,122 last year with a $280,000 bonus. 

Mr. Pope owns 10,000 UAL shares and has options to buy another 150,000 at $69 each.
That came to a combined $37.7 million under the $300-a-share buy-out, but just $21.3 million at yesterday's close. 

Of the combined $114.4 million the two men were scheduled to reap under the buy-out, they agreed to invest in the buy-out just $15 million, angering many of the thousands of workers asked to make pay concessions so the buy-out would be a success. 

United's directors voted themselves, and their spouses, lifetime access to the Friendly Skies -- free first-class travel, and $20,000 a year for life as well.
Conceivably, in a scaled-back buy-out, they could be bumped back to coach seats for life.
