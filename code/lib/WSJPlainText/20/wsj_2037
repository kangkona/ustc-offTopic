The Consumer News and Business Channel cable network and U.S. News & World Report have formed a joint venture to produce cable program versions of special issues of the magazine. 

The programs will run on the cable network the Sunday evening immediately prior to the release of the special issue of U.S. News & World Report.
CNBC is a joint venture of the National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co., and Cablevision System Corp. 

Advertisers will be offered an advertising package, which for a single price, will include time on the CNBC program and ad pages in the special guides. 

CNBC will produce six, one-hour programs, beginning in April 1990.
The first program scheduled in the joint venture is "The 1990 Homeowner's Guide." Other programs and special issues will be based on themes of health, jobs, personal finance, the best colleges, and investments.
The programs will be written and produced by CNBC, with background and research provided by staff from U.S. News & World Report.
