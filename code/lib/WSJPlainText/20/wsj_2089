Sandoz AG, a major Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group, said that its group sales rose 25% to 9.482 billion francs ($5.80 billion) in the first nine months of this year, with strong gains in all divisions. 

A year earlier sales totaled 7.567 billion francs. 

Positive currency rates and strong sales growth led to a substantial rise in consolidated profit in the period, although the company didn't provide figures, as is customary with Swiss companies. 

Sandoz said it expects a "substantial increase" in consolidated profit for the full year, barring major currency rate changes.
