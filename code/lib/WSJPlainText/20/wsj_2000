Rockwell International Corp. 's Tulsa unit said it signed a tentative agreement extending its contract with Boeing Co. to provide structural parts for Boeing's 747 jetliners. 

Rockwell said the agreement calls for it to supply 200 additional so-called shipsets for the planes.
These include, among other parts, each jetliner's two major bulkheads, a pressure floor, torque box, fixed leading edges for the wings and an aft keel beam. 

Under the existing contract, Rockwell said, it has already delivered 793 of the shipsets to Boeing.
Rockwell, based in El Segundo, Calif., is an aerospace, electronics, automotive and graphics concern.
