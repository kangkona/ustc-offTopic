Cross & Trecker Corp. said it reached an agreement to sell its Wiedemann division to recently created Murata Wiedemann Inc., a U.S. affiliate of Murata Machinery Ltd. of Kyoto, Japan. 

The agreement also includes the purchase of Cross & Trecker's Warner & Swasey (Switzerland) AG unit by a European affiliate of Murata Machinery.
Cross & Trecker is also selling its equity interest in a Japanese joint venture, Murata Warner Swasey, to Murata Machinery. 

Cross & Trecker, a Bloomfield Hills, Mich., machine-tool maker, said the net sales price of the total transaction is $24 million.
The Wiedemann division was one of three businesses put up for sale in Cross & Trecker's restructuring program announced in July.
Cross & Trecker said negotiations are under way for the sale of another company, RobertsCorp.
