Control Data Corp., Minneapolis, signed a joint development agreement with MIPS Computer Systems Inc. to incorporate an emerging computing architecture in future machines. 

MIPS is a leader in what is known as reduced-instruction set computing, or RISC, a technology combining microprocessors and sophisticated software.
In joining MIPS, Control Data follows several competitors in embracing RISC as a new design approach. 

Digital Equipment Corp., Tandem Computers Inc., NEC Corp. and Group Bull, among others, have similar arrangements with MIPs, based in Sunnyvale, Calif. 

Control Data said it expects its first RISC-based mainframe machine to be introduced next year.
The accord with MIPS calls for Control Data to share its expertise in data storage, the companies said. 

Control Data also said it is developing what it called a "supermainframe" computer, the Cyber 2000, intended for scientists, engineers and other users of generalpurpose high-performance computers.
