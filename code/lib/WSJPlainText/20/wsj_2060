Corning Inc. posted a 38% decline in third-quarter net income to $76.5 million, or 80 cents a share, from $123.9 million, or $1.37 a share, a year earlier. 

The year-earlier figure included a one-time gain of $59.9 million from the sale of Corning's stakes in Japanese businesses.
Without the gain, operating profit was $64 million, or 71 cents a share. 

The telecommunications, specialty glass, ceramic products and laboratory-services concern said the latest quarter included a tax-loss carry-forward of $600,000.
A year earlier, net included a $700,000 taxlow carry-forward. 

Sales rose 14% to $715 million from $625.4 million. 

Corning's chairman and chief executive officer, James R. Houghton, said operating performance continued to be strong in the telecommunications and health and science segments.
But the specialty-material segment slowed somewhat and consumer products continued below expectations. 

As for joint ventures, Mr. Houghton said profit was "essentially flat" due primarily to a slow recovery at Samsung-Corning Co. in Korea following a strike at a major customer and the disruption of shipments to China.
Also, profit was hurt by the strength of the dollar overseas which negatively affected the company's currency-exchange rate. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Corning closed at $38.50, down 75 cents.
