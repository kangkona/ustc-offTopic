Moody's Investors Service Inc., fretting about increasing competitive pressure on Ryder, placed about $2.8 billion in company securities under review for possible downgrade.
Ratings under review are Ryder's A-1 collateral trust debentures, A-2 senior notes and bonds, A-2 preferred stock and the company's Prime-1 rating for commercial paper.
Moody's said it is assessing the strategies Ryder's management may follow in addressing significant challenges in some major markets.
The rating agency said it is focusing especially on the transportation service company's efforts to control costs, improve margins and enhance its competitive position in its primary business, vehicle leasing and rental.
