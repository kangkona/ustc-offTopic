Sterling Software Inc. said it lost its bid to supply software services to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif.
Sterling, which estimated the value of the contract at $150 million, said NASA selected another bidder for final negotiations. 

In 1988, Dallas-based Sterling protested a similar decision by NASA involving the same contract, claiming it had submitted the lowest bid.
As a result, last March the General Services Administration board of contract appeals directed NASA to reopen negotiations on the contract. 

Sterling said it had requested a briefing by NASA but had not decided whether to protest the agency's latest decision.
