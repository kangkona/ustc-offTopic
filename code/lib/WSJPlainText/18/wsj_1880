Equitec Financial Group said it will ask as many as 100,000 investors in 12 of its public real-estate limited partnerships to give approval to rolling them up into a new master limited partnership. 

Under the proposal by Equitec, a financially troubled real-estate syndicator, New York-based Hallwood Group Inc. would replace Equitec as the newly formed master limited partnership's general partner and manager.
Shares of the new partnership would trade on an exchange like a stock. 

Hallwood is a merchant bank whose activities include the ownership, management and financial restructuring of shopping centers, office buildings, apartments and other real estate. 

In a statement, Equitec Chairman Richard L. Saalfeld said the transfer will benefit both the company and investors in the 12 limited partnerships included in the proposed rollup.
While he didn't describe the partnerships' financial condition, he said their operations "continue to drain the resources of Equitec." 

Equitec posted a $3.3 million net loss in the second quarter on $11.8 million of revenue, compared with a net loss of $12.9 million in the year-earlier period on revenue of $9.1 million. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Equitec closed at $2.625 a share, unchanged. 

Because of Tuesday's earthquake in Northern California, company officials couldn't immediately be reached for additional comment. 

A spokesman for Hallwood said the 12 limited partnerships, which were marketed by brokerage firms and financial planners between 1979 and 1984, raised several hundred million dollars from investors.
