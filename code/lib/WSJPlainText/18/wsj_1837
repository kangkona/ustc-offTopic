Bank Building & Equipment Corp. of America, which previously said accounting discrepancies its auditors uncovered would hurt earnings and require restatement of earlier results, increased its projections of the negative fiscal impact, and said it was exploring the company's sale. 

Bank Building, which builds and equips banks, had announced it would restate the first-three quarters of this fiscal year, which ends Oct. 31. 

On Oct. 5, the company estimated after-tax effects on the year's earnings would be "at least" $1.3 million.
Yesterday, the company said the negative after-tax effect on earnings for the year will be about $3.3 million.
For the nine months ended July 31, Bank Building had a net loss of $1 million, on revenue of $66.5 million. 

Bank Building, which expects to report a fourth-quarter loss, said it engaged advisers to "explore financial alternatives for the company including the possible sale of the company or one or more of its units." 

Company auditors are continuing their review, and final restated figures aren't yet available.
Bank Building earlier said the restatement is necessitated by "certain errors in recording receivables and payables" at its Loughman Cabinet division.
That division's manager has been fired. 

In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Bank Building closed at $4 a share, down 62.5 cents.
