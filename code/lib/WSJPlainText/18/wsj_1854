On Wall Street yesterday, northern California's killer earthquake was just another chance to make a buck. 

At the opening bell, investors quickly began singling out shares of companies expected to profit or suffer in some way from the California disaster, including insurers, construction-related companies, refiners and housing lenders.
Brokerage houses jumped in, touting "post-quake demand" stocks, and Kidder, Peabody & Co. set up a toll-free hot line for San Franciscans who might need emergency investment advice and help in transferring funds. 

"Wall Street thinks of everything in terms of money," says Tom Gallagher, a senior Oppenheimer & Co. trader.
However, he added, such event-driven trading moves typically last only a few hours and are often made without full information. 

The most popular plays of the day were insurance companies such as General Re Corp., which rose $2.75 to $86.50, Nac Re Corp., up $2 to $37.75, American International Group Inc., up $3.25 to $102.625, and Cigna Corp., up 87.5 cents to $62.50.
Yesterday, the brokerage firm Conning & Co. said insurers will use the earthquake as an excuse to raise insurance rates, ending their long price wars. 

Before this bullish theory surfaced, some insurance stocks initially fell, indicating that investors thought the quake might cost insurers a lot of money.
In fact, Fireman's Fund Corp., which ended the day off 50 cents to $36.50, said earthquake damage would slightly hurt fourth-quarter profit. 

On the prospect for rebuilding northern California, investors bid up cement-makers Calmat Co., up $2.75 to $28.75, and Lone Star Industries Inc., up $1.75 to $29.25.
Bridge and road builders had a field day, including Kasler Corp., up $2.125 to $9.875, Guy F. Atkinson Co., up 87.5 to $61.875, and Morrison Knudsen Corp., which reported higher third-quarter earnings yesterday, up $2.25 to $44.125.
Fluor Corp., a construction engineering firm, gained 75 cents to $33.375.
But home-building stocks were a mixed bag. 

Timber stocks got a big boost.
Georgia Pacific Corp., up $1.25 to $58, and Maxxam Inc., up $3 to $43.75, both reported strong profits.
Merrill Lynch & Co. touted Georgia-Pacific, Louisiana Pacific Corp. and Willamette Industries Inc. as the best post-quake plywood plays. 

Other gainers were companies with one or more undamaged California refineries.
Tosco Corp. jumped $1.125 to $20.125 and Chevron Corp., despite a temporary pipeline shutdown, rose $1 to $65. 

Meanwhile, shares of some big housing lenders got hit, on the likelihood that the lenders' collateral -- people's homes -- suffered physical damage and perhaps a loss in value.
Wells Fargo & Co. fell 50 cents to $81.50, and BankAmerica Corp. fell 50 cents to $31.875.
Some California thrift stocks also fell, including Golden West Financial Corp. and H.F. Ahmanson & Co., which reported lower earnings yesterday. 

"Property values didn't go up in California yesterday," says one money manager. 

Pacific Gas & Electric Co. fell 37.5 cents to $19.625.
One of its power generators was damaged, though the company said there won't be any financial impact. 

Pacific Telesis Group lost 62.5 cents to $44.625.
A computer failure delayed its earnings announcement, and some investors think it might have extra costs to repair damaged telephone lines. 

Heavy construction, property-casualty insurance and forest products were among the best performing industry groups in the Dow Jones Equity Market Index yesterday.
