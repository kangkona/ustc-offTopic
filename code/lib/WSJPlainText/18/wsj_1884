Stock prices closed slightly higher in the first routine trading day since Friday's big plunge.
Some issues were affected by Tuesday's devastating earthquake in the San Francisco area. 

Activity continued to slow from the hectic pace set during the market's plunge late Friday and its rebound Monday, as players began to set their sights on events coming later this week. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average drifted through the session within a trading range of about 30 points before closing with a gain of 4.92 at 2643.65. 

Broader averages also posted modest gains.
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 0.60 to 341.76, the Dow Jones Equity Market Index rose 0.71 to 320.54 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 0.43 to 189.32.
Some 822 New York Stock Exchange issues advanced in price, while 668 declined. 

But the Dow Jones Transportation Average went down for the seventh consecutive session, due largely to further selling in UAL.
The average dropped 6.40 to 1247.87 and has now lost 21.7% of its value since the losing streak began Oct. 10. 

Big Board volume dropped to 166,900,000 shares, in line with the level of trading over the past few weeks, from 224.1 million Tuesday.
Traders cited anticipation of the consumer price report for September, due today, and tomorrow's expiration of October stock-index futures and options as major factors in the slowdown. 

In addition, activity at a number of San Francisco-based brokerage houses was curtailed as a result of the earthquake, which knocked out power lines and telephone service throughout the Bay area. 

Stocks retreated to session lows just after the opening amid worries about the market impact of the quake, but quickly snapped back to higher levels with the help of futures-related program buying.
The early move essentially established the day's trading range, and traders said they saw little of the program activity that has battered the market recently. 

"I didn't expect it to be this quiet.
I expected to see more volatility as some of the institutions who were spooked last Friday did some selling," said Raymond F. DeVoe, a market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker, Baltimore. 

Mr. DeVoe said he expects prices to show some renewed instability over the next few sessions as institutions re-evaluate their stance toward the market in light of its decline. "I would suspect that a lot of investment committees are looking into whether (they) want to be in stocks at all," he said. 

Insurance stocks were sold at the opening amid concerns about the level of damage claims the companies would receive as a result of the earthquake.
But those issues recovered quickly and turned higher because of expectations that the quake and the recent Hurricane Hugo would set the stage for an increase in premium rates. 

Issues of insurance brokers were especially strong.
Marsh & McLennan advanced 3 1/8 to 75 7/8, Alexander & Alexander Services climbed 2 to 32 and Corroon & Black firmed 1 7/8 to 37 1/2. 

Elsewhere in the group, General Re rose 2 3/4 to 86 1/2, American International Group gained 3 1/4 to 102 5/8, Aetna Life & Casualty added 2 3/8 to 59 1/2 and Cigna advanced 7/8 to 62 1/2.
Loews, the parent of CNA Financial, rose 1 3/8 to 123 1/8. 

Companies in the construction, engineering and building-products sectors were among other beneficiaries of earthquake-related buying.
The heavy-construction sector was the session's best performer among Dow Jones industry groups; Fluor rose 3/4 to 33 3/8, Morrison Knudsen gained 2 1/4 to 44 1/8, Foster Wheeler added 3/8 to 18 1/4 and Ameron climbed 2 3/8 to 39 3/4. 

Among engineering firms, CRS Sirrine rose 5/8 to 34 1/4 on the Big Board and four others rallied on the American Stock Exchange: Jacobs Engineering Group, which gained 1 1/8 to 25 3/8, Greiner Engineering, which rose 3 1/2 to 22 1/2; Michael Baker, which added 1 1/4 to 15 1/4, and American Science & Engineering, up 1/2 to 8 1/2. 

Within the building-materials group, Georgia-Pacific climbed 1 1/4 to 58 and Louisiana-Pacific added 1 to 40 3/4 after Merrill Lynch recommended the forest-products issues.

Pacific Gas & Electric fell 3/8 to 19 5/8 in Big Board composite trading of 1.7 million shares and Pacific Telesis Group slipped 5/8 to 44 5/8 as the companies worked to restore service to areas affected by the quake. 

Chevron added 1 to 65.
The company, based in San Francisco, said it had to shut down a crude-oil pipeline in the Bay area to check for leaks but added that its refinery in nearby Richmond, Calif., was undamaged. 

Other companies based in the area include Hewlett-Packard, which rose 1/4 to 49; National Semiconductor, which went up 1/4 to 7 5/8, and Genentech, which eased 1/4 to 19 5/8.
None of the firms reported any major damage to facilities as a result of the quake. 

BankAmerica eased 1/2 to 31 7/8 and Wells Fargo lost 1/2 to 81 1/2; the two bank holding companies, based in San Francisco, were forced to curtail some operations due to the temblor.
Among California savings-and-loan stocks, H.F. Ahmanson eased 3/8 to 22 1/4, CalFed slid 3/4 to 24 1/8, Great Western Financial dropped 1/2 to 21 1/4 and Golden West Financial fell 5/8 to 29 1/4. 

UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, swung within a 14-point range during the course of the session before closing at 191 3/4, down 6 1/4, on 2.3 million shares. 

British Airways, a member of the group that had offered $300 a share for UAL in a leveraged buy-out, said it had yet to receive a revised proposal and it was "in no way committed" to the completion of a bid.
Separately, investor Marvin Davis withdrew his backup $300-a-share takeover offer. 

While UAL faltered, AMR, the parent of American Airlines, pulled out of its recent nosedive by rising 3/4 to 74.
The stock had been on the decline since the financing for the UAL buy-out fell through on Friday and developer Donald Trump subsequently withdrew a takeover offer of $120 a share for AMR. Also, AMR was the most active Big Board issue; 2.8 million shares changed hands.
