Hunter Environmental Services Inc. said it reached a preliminary accord on the sale of its environmental consulting and services business for about $40 million and assumption of related debt.
The buyer wasn't identified. 

The company said it also is making progress in negotiating the buy-out of its design division by management. 

In addition, Hunter said it will use proceeds from a private placement of $8 million of preferred shares to purchase an interest in a start-up company to underwrite environmental impairment insurance. 

Hunter wants to concentrate its resources on the insurance business and on a project to store hazardous wastes in salt domes.
