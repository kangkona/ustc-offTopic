Consolidated Rail Corp., New York, reported that third-quarter net income climbed 4.8% to $87 million, or $1.27 a share, exceeding analysts' expectations. 

In the year-earlier quarter, the freight railroad earned $83 million, or $1.21 a share.
James A. Hagen, chairman and chief executive officer, noted that earnings advanced "in the face of a drop in business, brought on by the general economic slowdown." Revenue slipped 4.6% to $835 million from $876 million. 

For the rest of 1989, Mr. Hagen said, Conrail's traffic and revenue "will reflect the sluggish economy, but Conrail will continue to take steps to control and reduce costs." 

For the nine months, Conrail earnings grew 0.4% to $229 million, or $3.34 a share, from $228 million, or $3.31 a share.
Revenue was flat at $2.59 billion.
