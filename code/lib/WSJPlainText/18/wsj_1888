Wang Laboratories Inc., Lowell, Mass., beset by declining demand for its computers, reported a $62.1 million, 38-cents-a-share loss in its first quarter ended Sept. 30.
Revenue fell 12.7% to $596.8 million from $684 million, although some of the decline was caused by discontinued operations. 

Wang had previously forecast a loss.
The company reiterated that it expects another loss in the second quarter and for the full year, although it expects a profitable fourth quarter. 

A year ago, Wang had earnings of $13.1 million, or eight cents a share, in its first quarter, including a $3.1 million loss from discontinued operations.
The latest period loss included a $12.9 pretax charge for severance payments.
