Viacom Inc., New York, reported that its third-quarter loss widened to $21.7 million, or 41 cents a share, primarily because of interest expense of $70.1 million. 

A year ago, Viacom had a net loss of $56.9 million, or $1.07 a share.
Interest expense in the 1988 third quarter was $75.3 million.
In the year-ago quarter, Viacom also paid preferred stock dividends of $17 million; Viacom exchanged its preferred stock for debt in March. 

The communications and entertainment company said revenue rose to $345.5 million, from $311.6 million. 

Viacom attributed the improvement to higher earnings from operations in its networks segment, which includes the MTV and Showtime networks. 

Viacom said it also restructured bank debt under a $1.5 billion unsecured bank agreement that offers significant interest rate savings.
Sumner M. Redstone, Viacom's chairman, said Viacom "emerged from our leveraged buy-out structure and gained substantial operating and financial flexibility through" the bank pact.
