Control Data Corp. agreed to sell its idle supercomputer manufacturing plant here to Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. for $5.8 million. 

The tentative agreement calls for 3M to use the 115,000-square-foot plant and 19 acres of land for research laboratories.
Control Data has been seeking a buyer for the facility since it folded its ETA Systems Inc. supercomputer unit this past April.
