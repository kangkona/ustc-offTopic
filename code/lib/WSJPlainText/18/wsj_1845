Diamond-Star Motors Corp., a joint venture of Chrysler Corp. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said it will begin shipping Mitsubishi Eclipse cars to Japan next week, emulating other Japanese auto ventures shipping U.S.-built vehicles back to Japan. 

Diamond-Star said it will export about 1,500 Eclipse cars to Japan by year's end. 

Honda Motor Co., the first Japanese auto maker to ship cars to Japan from the U.S., is now exporting more than 5,000 Accord Coupes a year from its Marysville, Ohio, factory.
