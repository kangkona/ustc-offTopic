The Associated Press's earthquake coverage drew attention to a phenomenon that deserves some thought by public officials and other policy makers.
Private relief agencies, such as the Salvation Army and Red Cross, mobilized almost instantly to help people, while the Washington bureaucracy "took hours getting into gear." One news show we saw yesterday even displayed 25 federal officials meeting around a table.
We recall that the mayor of Charleston complained bitterly about the federal bureaucracy's response to Hurricane Hugo.
The sense grows that modern public bureaucracies simply don't perform their assigned functions well.
