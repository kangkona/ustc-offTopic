Lotus Development Corp. reported a surprisingly strong 51% increase in third-quarter net income on a 32% sales gain, buoyed by strong demand for a new version of its 1-2-3 computer spreadsheet. 

The results topped analysts' expectations and the earnings growth of competitors, prompting traders to all but forget the product-launch delays that bogged down the company for much of the past two years. 

Yesterday, in heavy, national over-the-counter trading, Lotus shares rose to $32.50, up $1.25 apiece, capping a threemonth run-up of more than 40%. 

Lotus said net rose to $23 million, or 54 cents a share, on sales of $153.9 million.
A year ago, net was $14.3 million, or 31 cents a share, on sales of $116.8 million. 

For the nine months, net of $38.5 million, or 92 cents a share, trailed the year earlier's $49.9 million, or $1.08 a share.
Sales rose to $406 million from $356 million the year earlier.
In the first half, Lotus struggled to keep market share with costly promotions while customers awaited the launch of 1-2-3 Release 3, the upgraded spreadsheet software. 

Lotus's results were about 10% higher than analysts' average expectations and compared favorably with the 36% earnings rise reported a day earlier by rival Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Wash.
The company said results were bolstered by upgrades to Release 3 by previous customers and improved profit margins, the result of manufacturing-cost controls. 

Rick Sherlund, a Goldman Sachs analyst, said Lotus had upgrade revenue of about $22 million in the quarter, twice what he had expected.
Also, he estimated unit shipments of 1-2-3 in all its forms were about 315,000, up 7% from 1988's quarterly average. 

Demand for the new version was enabling Lotus to raise prices with distributors and to hold market share against Microsoft and other competitors that tried to exploit the earlier delays in Release 3's launch, Mr. Sherlund added.
He estimated that 1-2-3 outsold Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet by four-to-one in the quarter, and held a 70% or better share of the spreadsheet market.
