Georgia Gulf Corp., hurt by declining sales and falling chemical prices, said third-quarter earnings fell 13% to $46.1 million from $53.1 million in the year-earlier period. 

Sales declined 10% to $251.2 million from $278.7 million. 

The Atlanta-based chemical manufacturer said lower prices hurt margins for most products. "We did see some relief in raw material costs, but it wasn't sufficient to offset the drop in sales prices," James R. Kuse, the company's chairman and chief executive officer said in a statement. 

On a per-share basis, quarterly earnings remained at $1.85, the same as last year, because of the company's share buy-back program.
Georgia Gulf had 24.9 million shares outstanding on average in the quarter, compared with 28.6 million in the third quarter of 1988, adjusted for a stock split paid in January 1989. 

In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, stock in Georgia Gulf, which has been mentioned as a takeover candidate, rose $2.125 a share to close at $46.125.
