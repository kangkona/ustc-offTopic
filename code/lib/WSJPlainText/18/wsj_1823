The average publicly offered commodity fund fell 4.2% in September, largely because of the volatile markets in foreign currencies, according to Norwood Securities. 

The firm said that losers outnumbered gainers by more than three to one among the 122 funds it tracks.
For the first nine months of the year, Norwood said the average fund has lost 3.3%.
