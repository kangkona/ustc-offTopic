Continental Bank Corp. 's third-quarter net income slipped 11% despite a big gain from the sale of the company's London headquarters building. 

The $55 million gain on the sale was offset by lower interest income, poorer results from foreign-exchange trading and a $9 million loss on the sale of a unit, Securities Settlement Corp. 

Chicago-based Continental earned $65.2 million, or $1.04 a share, compared with $73.6 million, or $1.19 a share, a year earlier.
The 1988 quarter also included one-time gains totaling about $35 million. 

The bank, which has loss reserves equal to about half its long-term and medium-term loans to less-developed nations, said it doesn't think additional reserves are required.
