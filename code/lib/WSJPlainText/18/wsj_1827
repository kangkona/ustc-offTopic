Northrop Corp. 's third-quarter net income fell 25% to $21.5 million, or 46 cents a share, while General Dynamics Corp. reported nearly flat earnings of $76.5 million, or $1.83 a share. 

Los Angeles-based Northrop recorded an 8.2% decline in sales as B-2 Stealth bomber research-and-development revenue continued to ebb and high costs on some other programs cut into profit.
The aerospace concern earned $28.8 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales in the latest period were $1.25 billion, down from $1.36 billion in the 1988 quarter. 

At St. Louis-based General Dynamics, sales rose 10% to $2.52 billion from $2.29 billion.
It earned $76.4 million, or $1.82 a share, in the 1988 quarter.
General Dynamics credited significant earnings gains in its general aviation and material service segments, an earnings recovery in submarine operations, and higher military aircraft sales. 

Northrop said sales fell because of the decline in B-2 development dollars from the government as the plane continues its initial production stage and because fewer F/A-18 fighter sections are being produced in its subcontract work with prime contractor McDonnell Douglas Corp. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Northrop shares closed at $21.125, off 25 cents.
General Dynamics closed at $54.875, up 50 cents. 

Northrop, which since early 1988 has declined to accept fixed-price contracts for research and development, said earnings were hurt by excessive costs on a number of such contracts won years ago.
Among them were the ALQ-135 electronic countermeasures system for the F-15 fighter.
Northrop's interest expense also soared to $35 million from $17 million a year ago.
It said debt remained at the $1.22 billion that has prevailed since early 1989, although that compared with $911 million at Sept. 30, 1988. 

The backlog of undelivered orders at Northrop on Sept. 30 was $4.68 billion, down from $5.16 billion a year earlier. 

For the nine months, Northrop reported a net loss of $46.9 million, or $1 a share, compared with profit of $190.3 million, or $4.05 a share, in 1988.
Sales dipped 3.6% to $3.92 billion from $4.07 billion. 

At General Dynamics, factors reducing earnings in the military aircraft segment included higher levels of cost-sharing in development of the Advanced Tactical Fighter, and the high cost of an advanced version of the F-16 fighter.
F-16 deliveries also have fallen "slightly behind schedule," although a return to the previous schedule is expected in 1990, the company said. 

Backlog at General Dynamics rose to $16.5 billion from $15.8 billion.
Its interest expense surged to $21.5 million from $12.4 million.
For the nine months, General Dynamics earned $210.3 million, or $5.03 a share, up marginally from $208.8 million, or $4.97 a share, on a 4.9% rise in sales to $7.41 billion from $7.06 billion.
