A grand jury here indicted Norton Co. 's former director of advanced-ceramics research, charging him with interstate transportation of stolen property. 

Norton and General Electric Co. last month filed a lawsuit against the former research manager, Chien-Min Sung, charging him with stealing trade secrets. 

Mr. Sung formerly worked at General Electric in research on synthetic diamonds.
The criminal charges brought against him involved GE technology, according the court documents.
If convicted, he could be imprisoned for up to 10 years and fined $250,000. 

Mr. Sung couldn't be reached for comment.
He earlier denied the allegations against him in the lawsuit by Norton and GE. 

Norton makes sandpaper and other abrasives, diamond tools, specialty plastics and ceramics.
