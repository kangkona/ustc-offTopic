The government said 13.1% of Americans, or 31.9 million people, were living in poverty in 1988. 

While last year's figure was down from 13.4% in 1987 and marked the fifth consecutive annual decline in the poverty rate, the Census Bureau said the 1988 drop wasn't statistically significant. 

The bureau's report also showed that while some measures of the nation's economic well-being improved modestly in 1988, the fruits of prosperity were shared less equitably than the year before. 

Summarizing data derived from a March 1989 survey of 58,000 households, William Butz, associate director of the Census Bureau, said that "most groups either stayed the same or improved." But, he added, "Since the late 1960s, the distribution of income has been slowly getting less equal.
There was no reversal {of that trend} between 1987 and 1988." 

Per capita income, a widely used measure of a nation's economic health, hit a record in 1988, rising 1.7% after inflation adjustment to $13,120.
But the median income of American families fell 0.2%, the first time it has failed to rise since 1982. 

Mr. Butz said the divergence in the two measures reflects changes in family size and structure, including the rising number of female-headed families and a sharp increase in income reported by Americans who aren't living in families. 

As a result of last year's decline, the government's estimate for the number of people living below the poverty line declined by about 500,000.
The poverty threshold, defined as three times food expenses as calculated by the Agricultural Department, last year was $12,092 for a family of four.
The Census Bureau counts all cash income in determining whether families are below the line, but it doesn't consider other government benefits, such as Medicare. 

Thanks largely to the continued growth of the U.S. economy, the poverty rate is now substantially lower than the 1983 peak of 15.3%, but the improvements have been modest in the past couple of years. 

Poverty remains far more widespread among blacks than other Americans.
In 1988, 31.6% of blacks lived in poverty, compared with 10.1% for whites and 26.8% for Hispanics.
But two-thirds of all poor Americans were white.
More than half of poor families were headed by women living without men, the bureau said.
More than three-fourths of poor black families were headed by women. 

The poverty rate of children under 18 years old dropped last year to 19.7% from 20.5% in 1987, but remained far higher than a decade ago.
The rate among the elderly -- 12% in 1988 -- wasn't significantly lower than the year before.
If it weren't for Social Security payments, more than three times as many elderly would be below the poverty line, Mr. Butz said. 

The Census Bureau also said: 

-- Some 17.2% of all money income received by families in 1988 went to the wealthiest 5% of all families, up from 16.9% in 1987.
That is the greatest share reported for any year since 1950, although changing definitions over the years distort the comparison. 

-- The top fifth of all families got 44% of the income, up from 41.5% a decade earlier.
The bottom fifth of all families got 4.6% of the income, down from 5.2% a decade earlier. 

-- Confirming other government data showing that wages aren't keeping pace with inflation, earnings of year-round, full-time male workers fell 1.3% in 1988 after adjusting for higher prices, the first such drop since 1982.
Earnings of female workers were unchanged. 

-- Women working full-time earned 66 cents for every dollar earned by men, a penny more than in 1987 and seven cents more than in 1978. 

-- Median household income -- which includes both those living in families and those who aren't -- rose 0.3% last year to $27,225 after inflation.
It rose sharply in the Northeast and Midwest and fell slightly in the South and West.
Median family income was $32,191, down 0.2%. 

-- Per capita income of blacks, though still only 60% that of whites, rose 3.9% in 1988, while per capita income of whites rose only 1.5%. 

-- Among married couples, the gap between blacks and whites narrowed sharply, as income of black families shot up 6.8% while income of whites didn't budge. 

Fueling a controversy that has been simmering for years, the Census Bureau also said its figures would look far rosier if it recalculated the poverty threshold using an improved consumer-price measure adopted in 1983.
The bureau said some 3.5 million fewer people would have fallen below the poverty line in 1988 -- and the poverty rate would have been 10.5% instead of 13.1% -- under the alternative calculation. 

Critics on the left and right have been calling for all sorts of revisions to the measure for years.
A report by the staff of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress released yesterday concluded, "It is misleading to make this change without adjusting for other changes." 

The official poverty threshold is set by the Office of Management and Budget.
