Trinova Corp., Maumee, Ohio, said it is launching an extensive restructuring of its core business, and took a charge that resulted in a loss of $29.7 million, or 87 cents a share, for the third quarter. 

Trinova said it will close, move or overhaul 40 of its 170 manufacturing facilities and over the next three years cut 1,500 jobs from its current world-wide payroll of 22,300 employees.
Most of the factory closings and job cutbacks will affect Trinova's Aeroquip operations, which manufacture automotive plastics, hoses and other industrial and automotive parts.
Hoses and plastics together account for about 42% of Trinova's total annual sales. 

In a separate announcement, Trinova said the Aeroquip group has agreed to sell its spring-brake, piston-brake and related businesses to Midland Brake Inc. of Branford, Conn.
Terms weren't disclosed. 

To provide for the restructuring's costs, Trinova said it took an after-tax charge of $38.5 million, or $1.13 a share, in the third quarter.
The $29.7 million net loss compares with net income of $19.6 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose 8% to $456.2 million from $422 million. 

Trinova closed at $25, down $1, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
