John V. Holmes, an investment-newsletter publisher, and three venture-capital firms he organized were enjoined from violating the registration provisions of the securities laws governing investment companies. 

As part of an agreement that settled charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, a receiver was also appointed for the three venture-capital firms. 

Mr. Holmes was the subject of a page one profile in The Wall Street Journal in 1984, after the SEC questioned him about ties between him and companies he touted in a newsletter.
In 1986, in another consent agreement with the SEC, Mr. Holmes was enjoined from violating the stock-registration and anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws.
Without any admission or denial of guilt by Mr. Holmes, that agreement settled SEC charges that Mr. Holmes sold unregistered securities and misled investors. 

In charges filed last week in federal district court in Charlotte, N.C., the SEC alleged that Venture Capitalists Inc., Venture Finance Corp. and New Ventures Fund Inc., all of Charlotte, failed repeatedly to file proper documents.
The SEC also charged that Mr. Holmes acted as an officer or director of New Ventures, in violation of his previous consent agreement. 

"Some companies were delinquent in filings and other actions, all of which cost money," Mr. Holmes said. 

Two of Mr. Holmes's business associates who worked for Venture Capitalists, Kimberly Ann Smith and Frederick Byrum, also consented to being enjoined from violations of registration provisions of the securities laws.
Ms. Smith also agreed to a permanent injunction barring her from acting as an officer, director or investment adviser of any mutual fund, unit investment trust or face-amount certificate company. 

Mr. Byrum and Ms. Smith couldn't be reached for comment.
In consenting to the injunctions, none of the individuals or companies admitted or denied the allegations.
