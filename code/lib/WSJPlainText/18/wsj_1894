A group of investors, including Giancarlo Parretti's Pathe Communications Corp. and Sasea Holding S.A., have agreed to buy 76.66% of Odeon Finanziaria, a financially troubled Italian TV station. 

Florio Fiorini, managing director of Geneva-based Sasea, said the investors would pay only a symbolic one lira for the station, "but we have agreed to raise the capital that will enable the company to continue operating.
It's sort of a Chapter 11 situation," he added, referring to the U.S. bankruptcy law that protects companies from creditors while they restructure. 

Milan-based Odeon, which draws about 3% of Italian TV viewers, has debt of 250 billion lire ($181.9 million), Mr. Fiorini said.
He added that details of the recapitalization still have to be worked out, but that Pathe will take 50% of Odeon, Rome film producer Bruno Lucisano will take 10% and the remaining 16.66%, currently owned by Sasea, will eventually be sold to other investors.
Calisto Tanzi, Odeon's owner, will retain his 23.34% stake. 

Italy's Supreme Court this year ordered Parliament to write a law that will regulate media ownership. "We think that it's going to be far more favorable to own a station before the law is passed than to try to buy one afterward," Mr. Fiorini said.
