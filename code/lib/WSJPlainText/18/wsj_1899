This temblor-prone city dispatched inspectors, firefighters and other earthquake-trained personnel to aid San Francisco.
But a secondary agenda among officials in the City of Angels was to learn about the disaster-contingency plans that work and those that don't. 

Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley used the opportunity to push the City Council harder to pass a measure establishing a loss-recovery reserve of $100 million.
The amount would help Los Angeles cope in the first few weeks after its own anticipated quake, while waiting for federal assistance to arrive. 

After San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos spoke on television of the need for building inspectors to check the soundness of buildings, Los Angeles dispatched 32 inspectors to help.
And the county of Los Angeles placed its firefighters and sheriffs on alert, ready to send in reinforcements, and alerted San Francisco that the city has 1,000 hospital beds at its disposal. 

Two Los Angeles radio stations initiated Red Cross donation campaigns, and one Los Angeles bank manager forked over $150,000 of his own money for relief purposes, the Red Cross said. 

The Los Angeles Red Cross sent 2,480 cots, 500 blankets, and 300 pints of Type-O blood.
It is also pulling 20 people out of Puerto Rico, who were helping Huricane Hugo victims, and sending them to San Francisco instead.
