The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said it fined Capcom Futures Inc. $500,000 and accepted its withdrawal from membership as part of a settlement of disciplinary actions against the firm. 

Capcom Futures is a Chicago subsidiary of Capcom Financial Services Ltd., a London financial firm that was implicated last year in a scheme to launder drug money.
The case is pending.
The firm was indicted in Tampa, Fla., on money-laundering charges. 

In June, the Chicago Board of Trade said it suspended Capcom Financial.
The Capcom Futures unit withdrew from Board of Trade membership voluntarily in August, a Board of Trade spokesman said. 

Capcom Futures, while neither admitting nor denying the Merc charges, said in a statement that the Merc charges were "technical in nature" and that "no customers were hurt" as a result of the violations cited by the Merc. 

The Merc alleged that, among other things, from April 1987 through October 1988 Capcom Futures failed to document trades between Capcom Futures and people or entities directly or indirectly controlled by Capcom Futures shareholders.
