Enron Corp. said a subsidiary and two United Kingdom firms are studying the feasibility of constructing a 1,500 megawatt gas-fired power plant in northern England as an outgrowth of the government's privatization program. 

Enron Power Corp., a unit of the Houston natural gas pipeline company, would design, construct and run the plant.
Gas to fuel it would be piped from the North Sea. 

A subsidiary of Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries would buy electricity and steam from the proposed station.
Surplus power would be sold on the open market, Enron said.
Also participating in the study, Enron said, is the National Power division of Britain's Central Electricity Generating Board. 

Upon privatization, National Power will be responsible for 70% of the country's power generating business.
