Addington Resources Inc. said it called for redemption on Nov. 21 its $25.8 million outstanding of 8% convertible subordinated debentures due 2013. 

The debentures were issued in the face amount of $46 million on July 11, 1988, the Ashland, Ky., coal mining, water transportation and construction company said.
The company said the redemption is permitted because the price of Addington's stock has equaled or exceeded $19.60 for 20 consecutive trading days, a condition set in the terms of the debentures. 

Debenture holders are expected to convert most of the debentures into common because the value of the stock received in a conversion would exceed the $1,103.11 redemption price.
