Resolution Funding Corp. plans to sell $4.5 billion of 30-year bonds Wednesday in the agency's first sale of securities. 

The new bonds will be dated Oct. 30 and mature Oct. 15, 2019.
Tenders for the bonds, available in minimum denominations of $1,000, must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Wednesday at Federal Reserve banks. 

Refcorp, created by the thrift-overhaul law enacted in August, will use the proceeds to merge or sell off ailing savings-and-loan institutions.
Congress authorized $50 billion to be borrowed to pay for the thrift bailout.
Of that amount, $20 billion has already been borrowed by the Treasury Department. 

Unless otherwise specified in a particular offer, the bonds won't be subject to redemption prior to maturity.
Interest payments on the bonds will be payable semiannually. 

The bonds are subject to federal taxation in the U.S., including income taxes.
At the state and local level, the bonds are subject to surtaxes and estate, inheritance and gift taxes, but exempt from taxation as to principal and interest.
