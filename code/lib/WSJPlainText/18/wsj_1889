Dayton Hudson Corp. said it accepted for purchase seven million common shares at $62.875 each, under the terms of a Dutch auction self-tender offer.
The offer expired at 12:01 a.m. yesterday. 

In a Dutch auction, the buyer sets a price range and holders give a price in that range at which they're willing to sell their shares.
The buyer then picks a price and buys shares at that price from holders who offered to sell at that price or lower.
Dayton Hudson's repurchase offer, representing about 9% of its common shares outstanding, had established a range of between $60 and $65 for the buy-back. 

Dayton Hudson said it accepted all odd-lot shares tendered at or below the final $62.875 price; the preliminary proration factor for other shares tendered at or below the final price is 98%. 

The Minneapolis-based retailer said it expects to pay for the seven million shares next Thursday.
Tendered shares not purchased will be returned to holders. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Dayton rose $1 to $61.125.
