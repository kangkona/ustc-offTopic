Ford Motor Co. said it acquired 5% of the shares in Jaguar PLC. Jaguar, the London Stock Exchange and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are being notified of the transactions, the company said. 

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission advised Ford last week that it wouldn't raise any objection to the acquisition of as much as 15% of Jaguar shares. 

The No. 2 auto maker disclosed last month that it wants to buy as much as 15% of the British luxury-car maker, the maximum allowed under current United Kingdom government restrictions.
General Motors Corp. said it had discussed the possibility of a joint venture with Jaguar before Ford began buying shares.
GM said it still is talking with Jaguar about acquiring a minority interest.
