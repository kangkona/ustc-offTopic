Ports of Call Inc. reached agreements to sell its remaining seven aircraft to buyers that weren't disclosed. 

The agreements bring to a total of nine the number of planes the travel company has sold this year as part of a restructuring.
The company said a portion of the $32 million realized from the sales will be used to repay its bank debt and other obligations resulting from the currently suspended air-charter operations. 

Earlier the company announced it would sell its aging fleet of Boeing Co. 707s because of increasing maintenance costs.
