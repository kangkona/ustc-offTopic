Sharp increases in the price of fresh produce caused Spain's September consumer price index to shoot up 1.1% from the previous month, pushing the annual rate of inflation to 6.8%, the National Institute of Statistics said Friday. 

The monthly increase is the highest recorded in the past four years. 

The index, which registered 156.8 at the end of September, has a base of 100 set in 1983 and isn't seasonally adjusted. 

Prices have risen 5.9% in the first nine months of the year, outstripping both the initial 3% inflation goal set by the government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and the second, revised goal of 5.8%.
