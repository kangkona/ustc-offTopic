It was Friday the 13th, and the stock market plummeted nearly 200 points.
Just a coincidence?
Or is triskaidekaphobia -- fear of the number 13 -- justified? 

In academia, a so-called Friday the 13th effect has been set up and shot down by different professors. 

Robert Kolb and Ricardo Rodriguez, professors of finance at the University of Miami, found evidence that the market is spooked by Friday the 13th.
But their study, which spanned the 1962-85 period, has since been shown to be jinxed by an unlucky choice of data. 

In the '70s, the market took falls nine times in a row on Friday the you-know-what.
But the date tends to be a plus, not a minus, for stocks, according to Yale Hirsch, a collector of stock market lore. 

Another study found that the 82 Fridays the 13th in the 1940-1987 period had higher than average returns -- higher even than Fridays in general, which tend to be strong days for stock prices. 

On the only other Friday the 13th this year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about four points. 

Professor Kolb says the original study, titled Friday the 13th, Part VII, was published tongue-in-cheek.
In a similar vein, he adds that the anniversary of the 1987 crash and Saturday's full moon could have played a part, too, in Friday's market activity.
