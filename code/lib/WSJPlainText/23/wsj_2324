Syms Corp. completed the sale of its A. Sulka & Co. subsidiary, a men's luxury haberdashery, to Luxco Investments. 

Terms weren't disclosed. 

As Syms's "core business of off-price retailing grows, a small subsidiary that is operationally unrelated becomes a difficult distraction," said Marcy Syms, president of the parent, in a statement. 

A spokeswoman said Sulka operates a total of seven stores in the U.S. and overseas.
Syms operates 25 off-price apparel stores in the U.S.
