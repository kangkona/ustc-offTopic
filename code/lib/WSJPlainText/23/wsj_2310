PSE Inc. said it expects to report third earnings of $1.3 million to $1.7 million, or 14 cents to 18 cents a share. 

In the year-ago quarter, the designer and operator of cogeneration and waste heat recovery plants had net income of $326,000, or four cents a share, on revenue of about $41.4 million.
The company said the improvement is related to additional cogeneration facilities that have been put into operation.
