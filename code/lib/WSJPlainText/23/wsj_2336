MedChem Products Inc. said a U.S. District Court in Boston ruled that a challenge by MedChem to the validity of a U.S. patent held by Pharmacia Inc. was "without merit." 

Pharmacia, based in Upsala, Sweden, had charged in a lawsuit against MedChem that MedChem's AMVISC product line infringes on the Pharmacia patent.
The patent is related to hyaluronic acid, a rooster-comb extract used in eye surgery.
In its lawsuit, Pharmacia is seeking unspecified damages and a preliminary injunction to block MedChem from selling the AMVISC products.
A MedChem spokesman said the products contribute about a third of MedChem's sales and 10% to 20% of its earnings. 

In the year ended Aug. 31, 1988, MedChem earned $2.9 million, or 72 cents a share, on sales of $17.4 million. 

MedChem said the court's ruling was issued as part of a "first-phase trial" in the patent-infringement proceedings and concerns only one of its defenses in the case.
It said it is considering "all of its options in light of the decision, including a possible appeal." The medical-products company added that it plans to "assert its other defenses" against Pharmacia's lawsuit, including the claim that it hasn't infringed on Pharmacia's patent. 

MedChem said that the court scheduled a conference for next Monday -- to set a date for proceedings on Pharmacia's motion for a preliminary injunction.
