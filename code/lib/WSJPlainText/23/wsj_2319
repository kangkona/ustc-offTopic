Quest Medical Inc. said it adopted a shareholders' rights plan in which rights to purchase shares of common stock will be distributed as a dividend to shareholders of record as of Oct. 23. 

The company said the plan wasn't adopted in response to any known offers for Quest, a maker and marketer of hospital products. 

The rights allow shareholders to purchase Quest stock at a discount if any person or group acquires more than 15% of the company's common stock or announces a tender offer.
