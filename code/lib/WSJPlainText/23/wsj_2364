Inland Steel Industries Inc. expects to report that third-quarter earnings dropped more than 50% from the previous quarter as a result of reduced sales volume and increased costs. 

In the second quarter, the steelmaker had net income of $45.3 million or $1.25 a share, including a pretax charge of $17 million related to the settlement of a suit, on sales of $1.11 billion. 

The company said normal seasonal softness and lost orders caused by prolonged labor talks reduced shipments by 200,000 tons in the latest quarter, compared with the second quarter. 

At the same time, the integrated-steel business was hurt by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses, as well as higher labor costs under its new contract.
The service-center business was hurt by reduced margins and start-up costs associated with its Joseph T. Ryerson & Son unit. 

The company said it is beginning to see some shipping-rate improvements in both the intergrated-steel and steel-service-center segments, which should result in improved results for the fourth quarter. 

Inland said its third-quarter results will be announced later this week.
In the year-earlier third quarter, when the industry was in the midst of a boom, the company had net of $61 million, or $1.70 a share, on sales of $1.02 billion.
