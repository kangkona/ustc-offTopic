Plunge?
What plunge? 

Twenty-four New York Stock Exchange issues hit 52-week highs during Friday's trading, despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 190.58-point plunge. 

Stocks of utilities held up relatively better than other market sectors during the sell-off.
And among the issues hitting new highs were Detroit Edison Co. and Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. Other major issues hitting highs included American Telephone & Telegraph Co., Westinghouse Electric Corp., Exxon Corp. and Cigna Corp., the big insurer. 

Of course, many more issues -- 93 -- hit new lows.
These included International Business Machines Corp., which during Friday's session traded below $100 a share for the first time since June 1984.
IBM closed at $102, down $5.625.
Other new lows included Navistar International Corp., Union Carbide Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp., all of which are included in the industrial average. 

Meanwhile, two initial public offerings braved the cascading market in their maiden day of national over-the-counter trading Friday.
Shares of Rally's Inc., an operator of fast-food restaurants, closed at $17 each, up from its $15 offering price and shares of Employee Benefit Plans Inc., a health-care consultant, closed at $14.125, up from its $12 offering price.
