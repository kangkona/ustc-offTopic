Information International Inc. said it was sued by a buyer of its computerized newspaper-publishing system, alleging that the company failed to correct deficiencies in the system. 

A spokesman for Information International said the lawsuit by two units of Morris Communications Corp. seeks restitution of the system's about $3 million purchase price and cancellation of a software license provided by the Morris units to Information International for alleged failure to pay royalties. 

Information International said it believes that the complaints, filed in federal court in Georgia, are without merit.
Closely held Morris Communications is based in Augusta, Ga.
The units that filed the suit are Southeastern Newspapers Corp. and Florida Publishing Co.
