Amid a crowd of crashing stocks, Relational Technology Inc. 's stock fell particularly hard Friday, dropping 23% because its problems were compounded by disclosure of an unexpected loss for its fiscal first quarter. 

The database software company said it expects a $2 million net loss for the fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30.
It said analysts had been expecting a small profit for the period.
Revenue is expected to be "up modestly" from the $26.5 million reported a year ago.
Relational Technology reported net income of $1.5 million, or 12 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. 

"While our international operations showed strong growth, our domestic business was substantially below expectations," said Paul Newton, president and chief executive officer.
A spokesman said the company's first quarter is historically soft, and computer companies in general are experiencing slower sales. 

Mr. Newton said he accepted the resignation of Thomas Wilson, vice president of corporate sales, and that his marketing responsibilities have been reassigned.
The company said Mr. Wilson's resignation wasn't related to the sales shortfall. 

Relational Technology went public in May 1988 at $14 a share.
It fell $1.875 a share Friday, to $6.25, a new low, in over-the-counter trading.
Its high for the past year was $16.375 a share. 

In the previous quarter, the company earned $4.5 million, or 37 cents a share, on sales of $47.2 million.
