Southmark Corp. said that it filed part of its 10-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that the filing doesn't include its audited financial statements and related information. 

The real estate and thrift concern, operating under bankruptcy-law proceedings, said it told the SEC it couldn't provide financial statements by the end of its first extension "without unreasonable burden or expense." The company asked for a 15-day extension Sept. 30, when the financial reports were due. 

Southmark said it plans to amend its 10K to provide financial results as soon as its audit is completed.
