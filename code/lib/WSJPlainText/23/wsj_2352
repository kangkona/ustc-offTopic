The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in the Arcadian Phosphate case did not repudiate the position Pennzoil Co. took in its dispute with Texaco, contrary to your Sept. 8 article "Court Backs Texaco's View in Pennzoil Case -- Too Late." 

The fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend to be bound.
In the Pennzoil/Texaco litigation, the courts found Pennzoil and Getty Oil intended to be bound; in Arcadian Phosphates they found there was no intention to be bound. 

Admittedly, the principle in the cases is the same.
But the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts.
And the facts, as found by the various courts in these two lawsuits, were different. 

When you suggest otherwise, you leave the realm of reporting and enter the orbit of speculation.
