Concerning your Sept. 21 page-one article on Prince Charles and the leeches: It's a few hundred years since England has been a kingdom.
It's now the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, comprising Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and . . . oh yes, England, too. 

Just thought you'd like to know.
