The official White House reaction to a plunge in stock prices has a 60-year history of calm, right up through Friday. 

Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in a statement Friday that the stock-market decline "doesn't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy." 

"The economy," he added, "remains well-balanced and the outlook is for continued moderate growth." 

Sound familiar?
Here's what Ronald Reagan said after the 1987 crash: "The underlying economy remains sound.
There is nothing wrong with the economy . . . all the indices are up." 

Heard that before?
After the 1929 crash, Herbert Hoover said: "The fundamental business of the country . . . is on a sound and prosperous basis."
