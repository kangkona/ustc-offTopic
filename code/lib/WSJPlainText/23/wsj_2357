A group of Arby's franchisees said they formed an association to oppose Miami Beach financier Victor Posner's control of the restaurant chain. 

The decision is the latest move in an escalating battle between the franchisees and Mr. Posner that began in August.
At the time, a group called R.B. Partners Ltd., consisting of eight of Arby's largest franchisees, offered more than $200 million to buy Arby's Inc., which is part of DWG Corp. DWG is a holding company controlled by Mr. Posner.
One week later, Leonard H. Roberts, president and chief executive officer of Arby's, was fired in a dispute with Mr. Posner. 

Friday, 42 franchisees announced the formation of an association -- called A.P. Association Inc. -- to "preserve the integrity of the Arby's system." The franchisees, owners or operators of 1,000 of the 1,900 franchised Arby's in the U.S., said: "We have concluded that continued control of Arby's by Victor Posner is totally unacceptable to us, because it is extremely likely to cause irreparable damage to the Arby's system.
We support all efforts to remove Victor Posner from control of Arby's Inc. and the Arby's system." 

The group said it would consider, among other things, withholding royalty payments and initiating a class-action lawsuit seeking court approval for the withholdings. 

In Florida, Renee Mottram, a senior vice president at DWG, responded: "We don't think any individual or group should disrupt a winning system or illegally interfere with existing contractual relationships for their own self-serving motives."
