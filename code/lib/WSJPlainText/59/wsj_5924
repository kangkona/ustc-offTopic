Beckman Instruments Inc. said it will phase out about 150 jobs in its Bioanalytical Group and take other steps to reflect a world-wide slowdown in public spending for life science research at university and government laboratories. 

Beckman, a supplier of diagnostic and life science laboratory instruments and related products, said the jobs would be trimmed by year end.
The company said it would require the group's approximately 3,000 remaining employees to take five vacation or furlough days during that period because of the slowdown. 

The company said its Diagnostic Systems Group will be unaffected, and continues to post strong sales.
Sales growth in that unit should offset the impact of currency exchanges to result in a modest sales rise in the year, the company said. 

"Although we are experiencing difficult business conditions in the life sciences, we will continue our investment in the development of new products, since we expect a return to normal business as public spending for bioresearch revives," said Louis T. Rosso, Beckman chairman and president. 

Beckman, which was spun off by its former 84%-owner SmithKline Beckman Corp. earlier this year, has more than 7,000 workers.
