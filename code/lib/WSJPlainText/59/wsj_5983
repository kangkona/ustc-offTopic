The slowdown in monthly price growth for July was marked by a 0.2% contraction of energy prices, the first absolute decline since last November.
Energy prices were up 0.4% in June. 

Food-price growth slowed to 0.4% in July from 0.5% in June, while the growth rate for non-food, non-energy prices was unchanged at 0.2%. 

On a year-on-year basis, energy prices were up 5.2% in July, food prices were ahead 5.6% and non-food, non-energy prices showed a 4.4% increase.
