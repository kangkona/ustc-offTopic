Value Line Inc. said a one-time, after-tax charge of $7.5 million related to its sale of Integrated Resources Inc. commercial paper resulted in a fiscal first-quarter loss of $927,000. 

In the year-earlier quarter, the investment advisory service and money management firm had earnings of $4.7 million, or 47 cents a share. 

Value Line incurred the charge in June, when it bailed out its $600 million money-market fund by buying the fund's $22.6 million holding of Integrated commercial paper.
The company said that in a subsequent transaction it sold $21.7 million face amount of that commercial paper on the open market.
These transactions resulted in the $7.5 million charge.
At the time, Integrated had defaulted on short-term debt. 

In discussing the charge in its fiscal 1989 annual report, Value Line said it purchased the fund's holdings in order to protect its reputation and the continuing income from its investment advisory and money management business. 

Value Line said revenue in the first quarter ended July 31 fell 10% to $15.6 million, from $17.3 million the year earlier.
The company declined to discuss other aspects of the quarterly report. 

In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Value Line closed at $24, unchanged.
