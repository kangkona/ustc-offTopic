LSI Logic Corp. said it expects to report a $2 million to $3 million net loss for the third quarter ending Oct. 1, stemming primarily from underutilized capacity. 

Revenue for the quarter is expected to be $135 million. 

For the 1988 third quarter, the company had net income of $19.4 million, or 47 cents a share, on revenue of $259.5 million. 

The semiconductor concern said in June it had excess capacity, which was exacerbated by a slowdown in bookings and billings during the summer that has spilled into September.
In addition, LSI's Headland Technology affiliate had pricing pressures and lower-than-expected revenue. 

As a result of the slowdown, the company said it is freezing capital spending and operating expenses for the rest of the year. 

The company, whose stock was halted from trading briefly Friday pending news of the earnings projection, said it expects factory utilization to improve in the fourth quarter because for the first time it will produce semiconductors for other electronics companies under their own label. 

In national over-the-counter trading Friday, LSI fell $1.375 to $7.375.
