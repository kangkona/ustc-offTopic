CMI Corp. said it is cutting its Oklahoma City work force by 100 people, in part because of losses related to a waste disposal contract with the city. 

The maker of road-building equipment has about 800 employees in Oklahoma City.
It said it also is trying to reduce corporate expenses to strengthen its financial position. 

The company said benefits from the work-force reduction won't be evident until early next year. 

CMI operates a waste-disposal facility that converts solid waste to energy, which is then sold.
The company said Oklahoma City officials are considering making an offer for the contracts and assets associated with the facility on the basis of an appraisal scheduled for next month. 

In the first half of 1989, CMI had net income of $335,000, or one cent a share, on sales of $53.3 million.
