Nynex Corp. 's New York Telephone unit requested $880 million in rate increases as well as pricing flexibility and greater opportunities to raise profits, which have plummeted under "incentive" regulations. 

Analysts said the proposal, if adopted by the New York Public Service Commission, could help to improve Nynex's lackluster earnings. 

New York Telephone is proposing to nearly double basic monthly rates for residential service and to increase business rates about 25%, between 1991 and 1995, by eliminating subsidies, said John Hopley, the company's managing director of pricing and costing.
He said the company could try to woo its business customers by reducing rates for regional long-distance, Centrex switchboard and data-transmission services. 

The proposal would allow for a net revenue increase of 2% to 3% a year, Mr. Hopley said. 

Analyst Robert B. Morris III of Goldman, Sachs & Co. said the proposal could help reverse the earnings slide at New York Telephone, which contributes two-thirds of New York-based Nynex's profits. 

Mr. Morris said he has downgraded Nynex's 1989 earnings projections to $6.10 a share, from an estimate made in January of $6.65, and 1990 projections to $6.65 a share, from $7.05.
Last year, Nynex earned $1.3 billion, or $6.63 a share, on revenue of $12.7 billion.
Nynex spokesman John J. Bonomo declined to comment on earnings. 

Mr. Morris said the proposed plan would provide "an opportunity -- not a guarantee.
The company still has to perform." 

New York Public Service Commisioner Eli M. Noam said it's too early to say whether a rate increase is justified.
He said the commission hopes to act by December on the company's request for an initial $359 million rate increase, effective Jan. 1, and for a new regulatory plan, effective in 1991. 

A majority of New York commissioners doesn't have "as strong an aversion to rate increases as in some states.
We understand the need for new investment in the network," Mr. Noam said. 

New York Telephone said its overall rate of return has dropped to a projected 9% this year -- far below the 14% rate authorized -- despite new regulations in 1988 providing incentives to earn higher profit. 

The incentive plan hasn't worked, Mr. Hopley said.
A slow economy and stiff price competition have hurt revenue, and the plan freezes basic telephone rates until 1991, he said. 

However, analysts said the company's slow progress in cutting costs and boosting labor productivity was also a factor in its failure to meet profit projections. 

New York Telephone Comptroller Arthur Flaherty disagreed.
He said the company achieved all cost-cutting goals, including a $100 million reduction in labor expenses. 

The proposed initial rate increase of $359 million is to be applied toward replacing $367 million of inside wire.
An additional increase of $520 million is requested for 1991 so that the company can achieve a 14% rate of return and can begin eliminating subsidies on basic service. 

Under the plan, basic residential rates, currently $15.63 a month, would increase to an estimated $20 in 1991 and $30 in 1995.
Business rates, now $24.48 a month, would jump to about $27.50 in 1991 and $31 in 1995, Mr. Hopley said.
