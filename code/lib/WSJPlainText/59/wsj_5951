Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and Chiron Corp. began their previously announced $591 million, or $25.23-a-share, offer for the shares of Connaught BioSciences Inc. that they don't already own. 

As previously reported, the offer for the Toronto-based vaccine and pharmaceutical company is contingent upon the tender of at least 11 million Connaught shares and the rejection by Connaught shareholders of a rival stock-swap offer from Institut Merieux S.A. of France, 50.3% controlled by Rhone-Poulenc S.A., France. 

Ciba-Geigy, the Basel, Switzerland-based pharmaceutical concern, and Chiron, an Emeryville, Calif., biotechnology concern, already own 8%, or 2,045,640 shares, of Connaught's 25.5 million shares on a fully diluted basis.
If the minimum 11 million shares are tendered, Ciba-Geigy and Chiron, through a unit created for the acquisition, would gain control of 51% of the Canadian firm. 

Ciba-Geigy and Chiron said the offer will remain open through midnight Toronto time Oct. 17, unless it's withdrawn or extended.
