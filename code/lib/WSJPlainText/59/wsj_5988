Southdown Inc., Houston, said Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. agreed to buy Southdown's Pelto Oil Co. operation for about $320 million. 

Earlier this month, Southdown announced it had hired Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. to help it sell Pelto and that it planned to use the proceeds to pay down long-term debt.
Pelto assets last Dec. 31 included proved reserves of 169.8 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 7.2 million barrels of crude oil and condensate. 

Southdown, a producer of cement and concrete products, said the final sale price is subject to adjustment based on working capital figures and certain other conditions.
It said it expects to close the transaction by November 15.
Newark, N.J.-based Public Service Enterprise Group is a public utility holding company.
