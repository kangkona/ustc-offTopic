Southmark Corp., as expected, said it replaced National Heritage Inc. 's board through shareholder consents and elected Hugh C. Shurtleff as chairman. 

The move ends a bitter battle for control of National Heritage, which is 62.5% owned by Southmark and a Southmark unit.
Previously, only one Southmark director served on National Heritage's board. 

However, National Heritage, an operator of nursing homes and retirement centers, hasn't acknowledged the change.
A spokeswoman said late Friday that the company's agent still is counting and verifying the consents. 

Southmark said that at the first meeting of National Heritage's new board late Wednesday, Robert Galecke, a Southmark executive, was elected vice chairman of National Heritage.
Southmark, a troubled real-estate and thrift concern, said it hasn't made any other management changes yet. 

In addition to Mr. Shurtleff, a former executive of Valhi Inc. and a Southmark director, Southmark-supported National Heritage board members are George Brown IV, Arthur L. Crowe Jr., James A. Colquitt, John R. McDonough, T. Leigh Sanders Jr. and James A. Verbrugge.
All but Messrs.
Sanders and McDonough currently are Southmark board members. 

Mr. Shurtleff said the new board will review National Heritage's management and operations and try to improve its financial performance. 

National Heritage's management had tried to distance itself from Southmark and spin off its two main businesses into two new companies as part of a restructuring.
Southmark, which has said it plans to sell its health-care interests as part of its reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws, opposed the spinoffs and began a fight to gain control of National Heritage's board.
It had to have consents representing 66% of National Heritage's shares to change the method for electing directors and replace the board.
