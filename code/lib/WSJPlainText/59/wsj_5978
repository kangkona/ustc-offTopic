Prudential Insurance Co. of America completed its acquisition of Merrill Lynch & Co. 's 75% interest in Fine Homes International L.P. for more than $300 million. 

The acquisition included Merrill Lynch Realty, Merrill Lynch Relocation Management and related businesses operating within the Fine Homes master limited partnership. 

At the same time, Merrill Lynch said its Merrill Lynch Mortgage Corp. unit had closed the cash tender offer for all Fine Homes preference units outstanding.
Merrill Lynch said that based on a preliminary count, about 6.4 million Fine Homes units were tendered, or 82% of those outstanding. 

In conjunction with the offer's closing, Fine Homes directors declared a cash distribution on the partnership's subordinated units of 91 cents a unit, or about $19.6 million.
Those units were beneficially owned by Merrill Lynch, which has distributed them to holders of preference units. 

Merrill Lynch began its offer to purchase all of the preference units of Fine Homes last month.
