Properties of America Inc., Williamstown, Mass., said it "does not appear likely it will be able to continue operating" without filing under Chapter 11 bankruptcy law or seeking other relief.
While discussions with its creditors are continuing, the land marketer said, it "does not presently have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations." 

The company also said it expects to report a loss of more than $6.5 million for the year ended June 30, based on preliminary results.
Net income for the previous year was $1 million on sales of $26.4 million. 

The company also said John O'Brien, director, president and chief operating officer, resigned because of a disagreement in management policies. 

Three other directors resigned "for personal reasons," the company said, reducing the size of the board to four members.
The company won't elect additional directors at this time.
One of the directors will assume Mr. O'Brien's duties on an interim basis, the company said.
