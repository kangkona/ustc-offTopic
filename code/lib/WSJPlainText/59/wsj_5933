PepsiCo Wines & Spirits International said it plans to introduce Priviet, a premium vodka from Russia, in the U.S. in October. 

Priviet, whose ad pitch will be "Serious vodka you don't have to take too seriously," will be priced around $10 a bottle, compared with the $13 generally charged for PepsiCo's Stolichnaya line of Russian vodkas.
Priviet will be launched in Boston, Chicago, Dallas and Rhode Island.
PepsiCo expects to roll it out nationally next year. 

The new vodka will be included as part of a 1972 trade agreement between the Soviet Union and PepsiCo Inc., a soft-drink, snack food and restaurant concern.
Under the pact, Pepsi-Cola concentrate is sold to the Soviet Union, and in return, PepsiCo is given the rights to supply Russian vodkas in the U.S. 

Translated roughly from Russian, Priviet means "my best regards," PepsiCo said.
