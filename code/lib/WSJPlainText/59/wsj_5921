Eastland Financial Corp. said it would report a loss for the third quarter, resulting from charges and additions to its loan-loss reserves.
In the 1988 third quarter, the bank holding company reported net income of $2 million. 

Non-performing loans increased to $45 million as of Sept. 15, from $14 million at June 30, Eastland said.
Loan-loss reserves will be increased to $28 million from $5 million at June 30.
In addition, Eastland said it charged off $4 million in problem loans during the third quarter.
These actions will result in a third-quarter charge against pretax earnings of $27 million.
The increase in non-performing loans resulted from deterioration in collateral underlying some commercial and real estate loans, Eastland said.
