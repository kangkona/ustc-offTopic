United Brands Co. said it sold its 18.5% interest in FII Fyffes PLC, a distributor of fresh fruit and vegetables, principally in the United Kingdom. 

The food concern said the sale would be posted in the third quarter and would result in a gain of about 50 cents a share on a fully diluted basis.
In the third quarter last year, United Brands earned $2.7 million, or 90 cents a share fully diluted, on sales of $763.8 million. 

United Brands also said it was considering cost-cutting options, but wouldn't elaborate.
