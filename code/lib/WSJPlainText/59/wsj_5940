Bonneville Pacific Corp. said its fiscal first-quarter loss widened to $1.3 million from a year-earlier loss of $906,000 as a result of a corporate repositioning. 

Revenue for the quarter ended July 31 increased 51%, to $9.9 million from $6.6 million. 

Bonneville, which develops and operates alternative-energy plants, said in Salt Lake City that it is repositioning itself from short-term construction and the sale of power projects to long-time ownership. 

The company also said it is on target to meet its goal of generating 70% of its revenue from recurring power sales and owning 800,000 kilowatts of producing power projects by April
