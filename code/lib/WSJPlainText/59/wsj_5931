The South Korean government will partially liberalize foreign-exchange rates, officials said. 

The Ministry of Finance announced that foreign-exchange banks will be allowed to freely set daily buying and selling cash rates of foreign exchange applied for by customers beginning Wednesday, as the first step to liberalizing the foreign-exchange-rate system. 

Also, foreign-exchange banks will be given a free hand to decide telegraphic-transfer rates for the dollar every day within a 0.4% limit of the basic rate calculated by the Bank of Korea. 

For other currencies, such as the yen and the mark, domestic banks will be allowed to set buying and selling telegraphic-transfer rates within a 0.8% limit of the basic rate calculated by the Bank of Korea. 

Currently, the buying and selling rates of foreign exchange are fixed according to the calculated basic rate announced by the central bank.
The buying telegraphic-transfer rate for the dollar is 0.4% less than the basic rate, while the selling rate is 0.4% higher.
Similarly, the buying cash rate for the dollar is 1.5% less than the basic rate, while the selling cash rate is 1.5% higher.
