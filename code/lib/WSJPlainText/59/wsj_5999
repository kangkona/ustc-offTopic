Microsoft Corp. said its board authorized the repurchase of as many as one million common shares from time to time in fiscal 1990 ending June 30. 

The software manufacturer said it planned to buy the shares on the open market to reduce the dilutive effect to shareholders of stock issuances for the company's stock option and employee-stock purchase plans. 

The company had 56.2 million average shares outstanding on June 30.
