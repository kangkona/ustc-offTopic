Paris-based Eurocom hopes to conclude by late this week its negotiations with WCRS to buy a majority of WCRS's advertising business, according to executives close to the discussions. 

The executives said Eurocom will likely raise its 20% stake in the advertising business to 60% to 70%.
They said among the points being negotiated is a major international role in Eurocom's advertising business for WCRS's most visible ad man, Jerry Della Femina, chairman of Della Femina McNamee WCRS. Mr. Della Femina declined comment, and WCRS and Eurocom officials couldn't be reached. 

Eurocom has been attempting to raise its minority stake in WCRS's ad business to a majority.
At the same time, London-based WCRS is negotiating to increase its own stake in its 50%-owned Carat media-buying company in France.
Executives familiar with the discussions said WCRS will likely buy 100% of Carat, transforming WCRS from an advertising concern into a major media-buying firm.
