Investor Asher B. Edelman, who bought 30% of Datapoint Corp. 's stock last week to try to head off a battle for control, purchased most of the shares with funds from another company he controls. 

According to filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Intelogic Trace Inc., San Antonio, spent almost $15.5 million from working capital and other funds to purchase more than 2.5 million Datapoint shares, or about a 25% stake. 

Mr. Edelman is chairman of both Datapoint, a maker of computer products, and Intelogic Trace, a computer services company that was spun off to Datapoint holders in 1985.
Previously, Intelogic owned less than 3% of Datapoint. 

In the SEC filings, Mr. Edelman said he purchased the shares because New York investor Martin S. Ackerman has begun a consent solicitation to replace Mr. Edelman and the rest of the Datapoint board with Mr. Ackerman and his nominees.
Because of the purchases, Mr. Edelman and companies he controls now own about 40% of Datapoint. 

To succeed in his consent solicitation, Mr. Ackerman would have to gather votes of holders of more than 50% of Datapoint's shares. 

Mr. Ackerman has said he is considering a legal challenge to Mr. Edelman's purchases, among other options. 

Mr. Edelman couldn't be reached for comment.
An Intelogic spokesman said the company doesn't have any comment beyond the filings.
Mr. Edelman and other Intelogic officers and directors own 14.5% of the company's stock.
