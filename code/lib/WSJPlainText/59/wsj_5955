Vitro S.A. said it extended for a second time its unsolicited, $20-a-share tender offer for Anchor Glass Container Corp., Tampa, Fla.
The offer, valued at about $251.4 million for the 89% stake Vitro doesn't already own, is now set to expire Thursday at 5 p.m. EDT. 

Vitro, a Monterrey, Mexico-based conglomerate, had previously extended until last Thursday its offer for Anchor Glass, a maker of bottles and other glass containers.
The offer is considered the first unsolicited bid by a Mexican company for a U.S. concern. 

Anchor's board unanimously rejected the offer last month and adopted a poison pill, or takeover-defense plan, to thwart Vitro's bid.
An Anchor spokesman said the company believes Vitro's offer is too low. 

Vitro said about 7.7 million shares of Anchor's 13.9 million shares outstanding have already been tendered to Vitro. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Anchor Glass closed at $18.50, down 87.5 cents.
