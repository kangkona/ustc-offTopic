Salomon Inc. 's Salomon Brothers Inc., in a move affirming its growing emphasis on investment-banking activities, named Denis A. Bovin as head of the firm's corporate-coverage group based in New York.
The group comprises about 200 investment bankers. 

Mr. Bovin, 41 years old, is responsible for all of Salomon's corporate-related investment-banking business in the U.S.
His appointment is further evidence of Salomon's commitment to elevate its senior bankers in a firm once dominated entirely by salespeople and traders.
Salomon has struggled to shore up its investment-banking prowess as its profitability from trading, the dominant part of the firm, became erratic the past several years. 

"I like to spend most of my time working with clients," said Mr. Bovin, who joined Salomon in 1971. "In the 1990s, corporations are going to do business with investment bankers who provide creative financial and strategic advice," he said. 

In a related move earlier this month, Ronald M. Freeman was named head of Salomon's European investment-banking operations in London.
The 50-year-old Mr. Freeman had led international mergers and acquisitions in New York. 

At Salomon, Mr. Bovin, who gained prominence in advising technology and communications companies during the past decade, helped arrange Xerox Corp.s $1.6 billion acquisition of Crum Foster; Sperry Corp. 's $4.7 billion merger in the mid-1980s with Burroughs Co. (now Unisys); and the $2.5 billion acquisition of Ross Perot's Electronic Data System Corp. for General Motors Corp., among other transactions.
