Cash-strapped Lone Star Technologies Inc., Dallas, said it made an annual interest payment due Aug. 28 on its $50 million in 8% convertible subordinated debentures due 2002, preventing a default on its debt. 

A company spokeswoman said there wasn't a particular reason why the interest was paid last week.
Lone Star said it would postpone the payment in August because of a liquidity bind.
The payment had to be made by Sept. 26 to prevent a default. 

Separately, the company said a federal bankruptcy judge refused to let its Lone Star Steel Co. unit make $4.5 million in pension contributions for 1988 and before.
As a result, liens could be placed on the parent company's and other units' assets if the payment isn't made in 60 days.
