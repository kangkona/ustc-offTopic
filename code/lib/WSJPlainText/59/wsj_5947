Harlin Holdings Pty.
Ltd. raised its stake in Elders IXL Ltd., an Australian brewing, agribusiness, resources and financial-services company, to 39% on an undiluted basis, or 47% fully diluted. 

Harlin is a closely held concern controlled by Elders executives.
It owned about 18% of Elders. 

AFP Group PLC and Goodman Fielder Wattie Ltd., which jointly owned 17% of Elders, in May proposed to sell their stake to other Elders shareholders on a pro-rata basis at 3 Australian dollars (US$2.32) a share.
Harlin agreed to take up any Elders shares that other holders didn't buy. 

In a statement Sunday, Harlin said it acquired 285.1 million additional Elders shares through this underwriting agreement, or 15.5% of Elders. 

Harlin also is offering to buy on the stock market any Elders shares that holders want to sell at A$3 each.
That offer, which opened Aug. 28 and expires Sept. 27, so far has attracted 85 million Elders shares, bringing Harlin's beneficial ownership of Elders up to 39% on an undiluted basis and 47% fully diluted.
