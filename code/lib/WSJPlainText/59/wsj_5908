N.V. Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken may sell off part of its 90%-owned Polygram B.V. recording-company subsidiary in a public share offer within a few months. 

Philips Chairman Cornelius Van der Klugt says the Netherlands company is waiting for the right moment to launch a sale and that Philips will be able to say something more definitive about it within a few months.
Polygram is the third-largest recording company in the world. 

A Philips spokesman Friday, added that during the past month or so, the company firmed up its intention for a Polygram share offer, but that "the timing still isn't certain, although it could be within the next few months." 

Neither the Philips spokesman nor Mr. Van der Klugt would say how much of Polygram would be up for sale.
Analysts tend to expect at least 20% of the record company will be floated and listed on the stockmarket during the next year or so.
