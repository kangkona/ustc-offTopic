A group of four U.S. accountants has been asked to go to Poland this week by the U.S. Commerce Department to check on the status of the Polish accounting profession. 

With a proposal in Congress to give Poland anywhere from $100 million to $150 million, the Commerce Department wants to find out more about Poland's accounting methods. 

A Commerce Department spokeswoman said that Poland hasn't any national accounting standards. "Also, we're really not sure where the Polish accounting profession stands because we haven't compared it with our own yet," she said.
