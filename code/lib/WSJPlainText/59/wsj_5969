Inmac Corp., a catalog seller of computer-accessory products, posted losses for its fiscal fourth quarter and the year, largely as a result of the company's restructuring efforts.

Sales rose 9.7% to $59.7 million from $54.4 million. 

The company said the quarter included a $12.3 million charge as a result of restructuring costs associated with its international distribution network as well as other one-time expenses. 

Inmac said that as a result of its restructuring efforts it expects to see a decline in its operating expenses toward the end of this fiscal year. 

For the year, the company had a loss of $6.4 million compared with year-earlier net of $9.7 million, or $1.02 a share.
Sales increase 12% to a record $249.5 million from fiscal 1988 sales of $222.8 million.
