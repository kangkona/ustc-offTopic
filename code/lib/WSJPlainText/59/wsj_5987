Charles Gardner, a former Unisys Corp. vice president who pleaded guilty to charges of bribery and making illegal campaign contributions in the Pentagon procurement scandal, was sentenced to 32 months in jail and fined $40,000. 

Mr. Gardner ran the Unisys surveillance and fire-control unit in Great Neck, N.Y. Investigators have described him as the most important defendant charged so far in the three-year investigation and say he is an important link to the central targets of the inquiry. 

Mr. Gardner, who has been cooperating with prosecutors, was accused of systematically using funds from sham consulting contracts and other corrupt practices to set up a secret web of foreign and domestic bank accounts intended for bribes, illegal campaign contributions and for personal use. 

In March, Mr. Gardner pleaded guilty to bribing former Navy research chief Melvyn Paisley by helping to arrange the purchase of an Idaho condominium from Mr. Paisley at an inflated price.
Through his lawyers, Mr. Paisley has denied any wrongdoing. 

James Neal, a former Unisys consultant and close associate of Mr. Gardner who also pleaded guilty to bribery-related charges, was sentenced to 27 months in jail and fined $30,000.
Mr. Neal has admitted conspiring with Mr. Gardner to bribe Mr. Paisley and to participating in a bribery scheme to funnel $400,000 to a Bahamas company owned by Garland Tomlin, a Navy acquisition official awaiting sentencing for his activities.
