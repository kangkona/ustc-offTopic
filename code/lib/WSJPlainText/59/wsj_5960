Cascade Corp. posted a 6% gain in net income for the second quarter ended July 31 on a 13% sales rise.

The company posted net of $3 million, or 50 cents a share, up from year-earlier net of $2.8 million, or 47 cents a share.
Sales increased to $39.2 million from $34.6 million. 

In the first six months, net was $5.7 million, or 95 cents a share, a slight drop from $5.8 million, or 97 cents a share, a year earlier.
