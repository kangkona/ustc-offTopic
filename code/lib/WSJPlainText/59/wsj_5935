The Justice Department said it has taken over litigation of a whistleblower's lawsuit alleging fraud by Fairchild Control Systems Co., a unit of Paris-based Matra 

The government charges that Fairchild Control, a former division of Fairchild Industries Inc., deliberately sold the Air Force defective devices used to test the transfer of fuel from jet fighters' spare tanks.
The devices were supposed to eliminate the need for inflight tests of the tanks. 

Actual damages haven't been established, but penalties for the alleged false claims alone could exceed $1 million, the Justice Department said.
The original suit was filed in July 1988 by Neil Aliksanian, who had been a program manager for Fairchild Control until September 1987. 

A Matra spokeswoman said the company hasn't received the lawsuit and officials won't comment until they can review it.
