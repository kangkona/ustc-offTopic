Whittle Communications Limited Partnership, under fire from educators for its Channel One TV news program for schools, said it has sold $150 million in advertising time on the planned satellite-delivered network. 

Industry observers and critics of Channel One had expected controversy surrounding the commercially supported school program to cripple Whittle's sales effort to advertisers.
Educational groups have sharply criticized Whittle for the four 30-second commercials that will air on the daily 12-minute news program. 

Christopher Whittle, chairman of the media company, said that after only three months of selling, he has received signed contracts from five national advertisers over eight different product categories.
The contracts with advertisers are all at least three years long and currently range in size from $13 million to $53 million.
Advertisers are paying $150,000 per 30-second spot per day. 

Mr. Whittle said the advertising contracts contained $51 million in the first year of the program.
He said he estimates he'll sell $90 million in commercial time in the first year, "way over" the amount needed to break even in Channel One's first year. 

Channel One will be launched in at least 1,000 schools in March 1990.
By December 1990, Mr. Whittle said he will have as many as 8,000 schools equipped to receive Channel One, which will reach an estimated six million students. 

Mr. Whittle won't disclose the names of the advertisers, but they are expected to be makers of jeans, soft drinks, athletic shoes and other products targeted at high school students.
