Amoco Corp., Chicago, said it may sell its refining and marketing operations in the United Kingdom, where it holds only about 2% of the gasoline market. 

The oil company said its Amoco (U.K.) Ltd. subsidiary has hired Morgan Stanley & Co. 's international unit to assist it in divesting the operations.
The company said the possible sale is part of a long-term strategy to shed refining and marketing operations outside the U.S. Amoco already has shed such operations in Italy, Australia and India. 

"Several parties" interested in acquiring the facilities have already approached the company, Amoco said, although it didn't identify or characterize the parties.
The facilities include a 70% interest in the Milford Haven refinery, 250 service stations and interests in an oil pipeline and five product terminals.
The refinery has a capacity of about 108,000 barrels a day, a relatively modest output.
