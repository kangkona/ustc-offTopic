DeTomaso Industries Inc., Red Bank, N.J., said the National Association of Securities Dealers delisted its stock because of the company's negative net tangible asset position that arose from operating losses. 

DeTomaso Chairman Alejandro DeTomaso said the company will appeal the decision to NASD's Board of Governors.
The stock will continue to trade on the national over-the-counter market, but it no longer will be quoted on NASD's automated quotation system.
The company had been operating since October 1988 with an exemption from NASD's listing requirements. 

Mr. DeTomaso also said negotiations over long-term production with "certain automobile companies" are "proceeding satisfactorily." He declined to name the auto makers, but Fiat S.p.
A. recently announced it is negotiating to use some of DeTomaso's excess manufacturing capacity.
A spokesman for the company said Mr. DeTomaso expects to conclude the negotiations within the next 60 days. 

DeTomaso Industries, which makes Maserati automobiles, Innocenti mini-cars and Moto Guzzi and Benelli motorcycles through its Italian units, had a loss of $29.4 million last year and another $3.8 million through the first six months of this year.
