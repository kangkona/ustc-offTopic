Thyssen AG's group pretax income soared at a double-digit rate in the year ending Sept. 30, 1989, a company spokesman said Friday. 

A spokesman for the Frankfurt, West Germany, steel and engineering group, also said group sales rose 14% to about 33 billion marks ($16.8 billion) in fiscal 1989 from 29 billion marks in fiscal 1988. 

He couldn't provide more detailed data on earnings but said a "very positive" trend recorded in earnings in the first half of fiscal 1989 continued in the second half.
Thyssen's first-half group pretax profit more than doubled to 892 million marks from 431 million marks in the year-earlier period, while net over the same period gained 29%.
