BCE Development Corp. said it expects "material" writedowns of its real estate portfolio and suspended payment of its preferred share dividends. 

The 67%-owned real-estate subsidiary of Montreal-based BCE Inc. said a review of the value of its properties is underway.
The company had 2.09 billion Canadian dollars (US$1.76 billion) of property on its books at the end of last year, mostly in the U.S. 

The move wasn't a suprise.
BCE Development said last month that it would have to review the value of its properties if a C$700 million bid for the company didn't succeed.
The bidder, Toronto's Olympia & York Developments Ltd., later dropped the bid when an insufficient number of the concern's securities were tendered. 

BCE Development said dividends on the preferred shares would continue to accumulate during the suspension.
It said dividends of its subsidiaries will continue to be paid.
The company hasn't paid any common share dividends since January 

In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday, BCE Development closed at C$1.91, down seven Canadian cents.
