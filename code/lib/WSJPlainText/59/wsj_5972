Kerr-McGee Corp. said it created an Employee Stock Ownership Plan to be funded by a $125 million loan guaranteed by the company. 

At current market prices, the new ESOP would be able to purchase about 2.5 million Kerr-McGee shares, or 5.2% of the 48.3 million shares now outstanding. 

According to Kerr-McGee's May proxy statement, officers and directors own only 4.4% of the company, so the projected combined ownership of management and the ESOP still would be less than 10%. 

A spokesman for the energy and chemical company said the move wasn't intended as a defensive measure. "This is intended for employee benefit reasons," he said. 

The company has long been viewed as a potentially attractive takeover candidate, and Elders IXL Ltd., an Australian concern, disclosed in July that it owned 4.7% of the company.
Just a few days before that disclosure, Kerr-McGee strengthened provisions of its anti-takeover measure. 

The company said that beginning Jan. 1, the company will match employee contributions to the ESOP instead of matching contributions to the company's current savings investment plan.
