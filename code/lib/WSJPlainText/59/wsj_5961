Di Giorgio Corp., San Francisco, said "a number of third parties" have expressed interest in acquiring part or all of the food products and building materials marketing and distribution firm. 

As previously reported, the company last month rejected as inadequate an unsolicited $32-a-share tender offer by DIG Acquisition Corp., a unit of Rose Partners Limited Partnership and its sole general partner, Arthur Goldberg.
But Di Giorgio directors left open the door for a suitor with a better offer. 

Di Giorgio said the most recent expressions of interest are preliminary, but it said the board authorized management and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., the firm's financial adviser, to continue to explore alternatives to DIG's offer and to seek formal proposals for the sale of the entire company or some of its business units. 

Di Giorgio, which has 5.1 million shares outstanding, closed at $33.75 a share, up $1, in composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. 

"We're going to ask the board to live up to their fiduciary duty," said Mr. Goldberg.
He added, "We're the only bid out there" with financing.
He said he expected to respond formally to the Di Giorgio announcement today.
