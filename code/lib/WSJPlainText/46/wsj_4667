Two Stanford University researchers said an Italian drug is to be tested soon as a means of suppressing the AIDS virus. 

Drs.
Leonard and Leonore Herzenberg, a husband-and-wife team of Stanford geneticists, speculate that the drug, N-acetylcysteine, or NAC, made by Zambon Group of Italy, may counteract the virus-boosting effects of the tumor-necrosis factor, or TNF.
A naturally occuring protein, TNF is believed to activate the AIDS virus, and to cause the cachexia or wasting associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 

Currently, the drug NAC is used in the U.S. as an antidote for overdoses of acetominophen, or Tylenol.
In Europe, it is used to treat bronchitis. 

Leonore Herzenberg said the drug is slated for a "community-based trial," run by practicing doctors rather than the research establishment; she declined to identify who the trial organizers would be. 

Amid the wild acclamation sometimes given the AIDS drug fads, Dr. Herzenberg urged patients not to rush into self-experimentation with NAC. 

"We hope things won't go crazy," she said. "This is a lab result.
We don't know if it works in humans.
It works in the test tube." 

But even while asserting test-tube efficacy, Dr. Herzenberg acknowledged that the researchers hadn't, in fact, tested NAC against live AIDS virus.
Instead, NAC was tested in a simulation that combined kidney cells and AIDS virus genes.
Other reseachers question the validity of this screening system.
