Peter Cole, president and chief executive of Central Capital Corp., said the Toronto financial services concern isn't seeking to acquire Lincoln Savings & Loan Association. 

In June, the U.S. Federal Home Loan Bank Board said that Central Capital had sent a letter to federal regulators proposing to buy the California thrift, which is in receivership. 

Mr. Cole said the letter "wasn't an overture" by Central Capital, but "a way of putting ourselves forward as someone who should be remembered" by regulators if they were looking for a party to rescue the unit of American Continental Corp., of Phoenix, Ariz. 

Mr. Cole said Central Capital is engaged in "nothing current" concerning Lincoln Savings.
He said the matter is "a file item that could be opened, but at the moment we aren't giving it priority."
