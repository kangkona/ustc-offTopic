Public Service Co. of Colorado said a number of financial uncertainties led it to withdraw its offer to buy the generation, transmission and related assets of Colorado-Ute Electric Association. 

PS of Colorado, an investor-owned utility, said the acquisition plan was withdrawn primarily "because it did not appear to meet Colorado-Ute's expectations" and because of some information uncovered during a review of Colorado-Ute's financial situation and facilities. 

PS of Colorado said that specifically the uncertainties and contingent liabilities associated with an experimental power plant, a power plant sale and leaseback plan and other tax liabilities were "significantly greater" than it had anticipated.
Additionally, the utility said many of ColoradoUte's creditors are now less willing to consider debt-restructuring plans than they were some months ago. en
