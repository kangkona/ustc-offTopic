The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Options Clearing Corp. received regulatory approval for a cross-margining agreement that could sharply reduce the amount of money member firms need to post to trade stock-index futures and options. 

The agreement, which will take effect Oct. 6 for the proprietary, or noncustomer, accounts of member firms, is designed to increase the amount of money available to traders making markets in futures and options.
Cross-margining was a key recommendation of the so-called Brady Commission that studied the 1987 stock market crash.
That presidential task force concluded that liquidity was sapped from the futures and options markets during the crash by what, in the case of offsetting futures and options trading positions that actually reduce overall risk, are often duplicative margin requirements. 

The cross-margining accord will allow members to make a single margin deposit to cover their trading risk in related stock-index futures and options accounts, rather than separate deposits at the Merc and one of the OCC-member options exchanges. 

William Brodsky, the Merc's president, said the exchange and the OCC will apply shortly for regulatory approval to extend cross-margining to include the accounts of other market professionals such as floor traders and market makers.
