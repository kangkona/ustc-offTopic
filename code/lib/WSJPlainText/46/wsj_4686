Pembridge Investments Ltd., a Bermuda-registered holding company headed by a former colleague of financier Sir James Goldsmith, launched a #697 million ($1.13 billion) takeover bid for U.K. paper and packaging concern DRG PLC. 

Pembridge is offering 590 pence ($9.54) for each DRG share.
It said this month that it would make a bid at "somewhat below" the market price at the time, which was 604 pence.
Nevertheless, DRG shares jumped 4 to 599 pence on London's stock exchange yesterday. 

DRG officials so far have spurned the approach by Pembridge, which has built up a 25% stake in DRG.
To win over a majority of holders, analysts say, Pembridge may have to increase its offer to 650 or 700 pence a share.
But at that level, they say, the high cost of Pembridge's financing would quickly erode the potential profit from breaking up the company.
