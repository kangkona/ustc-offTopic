Southmark Corp., moving to finally take control of its recalcitrant National Heritage Inc. subsidiary, ousted National Heritage's president and rearranged National Heritage's corporate structure. 

Southmark, a real estate and thrift concern, said that Hugh C. Shurtleff, a Southmark director and National Heritage chairman, was named National Heritage president.
He succeeds James R. Gilley, who was fired as president and chief executive officer.
A new chief executive officer wasn't named for the unit, a manager of nursing homes and retirement centers. 

Southmark also said its board has merged National Heritage's two subsidiaries into National Heritage and National Heritage's board has assumed control of the units' assets and operations. 

The move reverses Monday's action by National Heritage, in which it said it elected a dissident Southmark director to be chairman of the two units and had named other outside Southmark directors to the subsidiaries' boards.
The move was intended to give Southmark representation on the subsidiaries' boards without winning the approval of Southmark's board or its management. 

Southmark owns 62.5% of National Heritage.
Earlier this month, it replaced National Heritage's board through shareholder consents and named Mr. Shurtleff as chairman, succeeding Mr. Gilley.
But Southmark hadn't been able to take control of National Heritage's assets because the stock of National Heritage's subsidiaries had been placed in a trust to be distributed to National Heritage stockholders. 

Southmark, which is operating under bankruptcy-law protection from creditors, said Mr. Gilley was fired for failing to respond to a majority of shareholders' demands for change.
To take control of the company, Southmark said that it placed a "transition team" in National Heritage's offices and sent some managers home for the day.
