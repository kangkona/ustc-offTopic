GTE Airfone Inc., citing confusion among some airline passengers about prices, said it will restructure its rates, effective Sunday. 

Air-to-ground telephone users now pay $7.50 for the first three minutes and $1.25 for each additional minute.
Under the new rates, each call will cost $2 for a connection fee and $2 for each minute.
This means a rate cut for short calls, but an increase for calls of three minutes or longer.
For example, a two-minute call will decline to $6 from $7.50, while a three-minute conversation will rise to $8. 

A spokesman for the unit of GTE Corp., a Stamford, Conn., telecommunications, lighting and precision-materials company, said, "We're looking for this new rate structure to allow more people to use the service." The current rates, he explained, had left "misimpressions" of higher prices for making calls, especially among leisure travelers. 

A spokesman at one airline said its passengers' Airfone calls typically last three to five minutes.
Airfone is part of GTE Mobile Communications Group and doesn't break out operating profit or revenue.
