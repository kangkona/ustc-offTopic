.START 

Grow Group Inc., New York, reached a standstill accord with a group of dissident shareholders and agreed to nominate a representative of the dissidents to the board. 

The group, which holds 9.4% of Grow Group and is led by Edward S. Buchanan, a Massachusetts investor, had sought to elect three directors at the Oct. 25 annual meeting.
The group had been seeking "an immediate sale" of Grow Group to try to boost its value to shareholders. 

The standstill accord provides that the group won't increase its holding in Grow Group to more than 10% for three years.
In turn, the maker of coatings, paints and household products will add James J. Apostolakis, designated by the holder group, as the fourth nominee on its slate.
The board would expand to 10 if all four are elected. 

Terms of the agreement provide that the group can nominate an additional director at the 1990 annual meeting.
Should the additional nominee be named to the board, the company and the group would extend the standstill agreement for one year, Grow Group said.
If the nominee isn't elected, the standstill pact would be cut by one year. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Grow Group fell 62.5 cents, to $10.50.
