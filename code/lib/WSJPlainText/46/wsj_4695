Japan's gross national product, or the total output of goods and services, contracted 0.8% in the April-June quarter from the previous three months, according to the Economic Planning Agency. 

The contraction was mainly because of a drop in personal spending in reaction to a surge ahead of the introduction of a 3% consumption tax in April. 

But private-sector and government economists say the economy maintains its momentum after overcoming the deflationary impact of the yen's sharp rise. 

The agency report said personal consumption, a key to economic growth accounting for nearly 60% of GNP, was generally strong despite a drop in household spending in July.
