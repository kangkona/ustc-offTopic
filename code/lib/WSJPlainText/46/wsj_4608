Acclaim Entertainment Inc. expects to report that net income for its fiscal year ended Aug. 31 as much as doubled from the previous year, Gregory E. Fischbach, chairman and chief executive officer, said. 

Net rose to between $8.5 million and $9.5 million, or 53 cents to 55 cents a share, from the year-earlier $4.7 million, or 28 cents a share, Mr. Fischbach said.
The year-ago figure is adjusted for a 1-for-2 reverse stock split effected July 24, 1989.
Revenue advanced between 74% and 77%, to between $68.5 million and $69.5 million, from the year-ago $39.3 million. 

For the first nine months of 1989, Acclaim earned $6.1 million, or 36 cents a share, on sales of $44.1 million. 

The publisher, marketer and distributor of home-video entertainment products, founded in March 1987, said it expects to report that its available cash climbed to $14 million from $10 million a year ago.
A plan to raise an additional $25 million through the sale of debentures has been "temporarily suspended," Mr. Fischbach said in an interview, "because it would look like we're heavily into junk bonds." 

Acclaim ties the results to the continuing popularity of home video games.
The company creates games for use on Nintendo Co. 's equipment, and programs such as Wrestlemania, Rambo, Wizards and Warriors and Tiger-Heli have helped the company.
Nintendo accounts for about 80% of Acclaim's sales. 

In national over-the-counter trading, Acclaim closed at $6.75, down 12.5 cents. 

With a stock-market valuation exceeding $140 million, Acclaim continues to look for acquisitions and has retained investment banker Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney Inc. to help. 

Mr. Fischbach, who in the fiscal fourth quarter reduced his stake in Acclaim to 35% from 40%, said he was interested in book, magazine and music publishing companies, though the company has no acquisitions on the horizon. 

"The Nintendo market has grown from 10 million homes in 1988 to about 20 million by the end of this year," he said.
But he notes a natural danger in tying the future of a company to a product that could be pigeon-holed as a fad. "I'm always concerned about how fickle the market is," says Mr. Fischbach. "But we're continuing to look for new opportunities and new companies for our software programs."
