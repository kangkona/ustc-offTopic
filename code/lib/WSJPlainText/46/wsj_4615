Midway Airlines flight attendants ratified by mail ballot their first contract with the carrier, according to the Association of Flight Attendants. 

The association said the three-year agreement includes a new pay scale based on length of service for Midway's 650 flight attendants.
It said the pay scale includes higher compensation in all brackets over the life of the contract. 

The agreement was reached after 17 months of negotiations between the airline and the union, including 11 months of federal mediation.
