Dasibi Environmental Corp. will ask shareholders to approve a change in the company's name to Pollution Research & Control Corp. 

The company said in proxy material that it will continue to conduct business through a subsidiary using the name "Dasibi" to preserve good will associated with the name, but will adopt a new name for the parent corporation to identify the company's business. 

Dasibi also will ask holders to approve a boost in the authorized common shares to 10 million from five million and to approve certain indemnification for directors under California corporate law.
The company has about 3.4 million shares outstanding.
