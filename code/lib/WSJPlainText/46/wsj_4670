Holly Corp. said it set its fiscal 1990 capital budget at $29 million, more than quadruple fiscal 1989 expenditures of about $6 million. 

The petroleum products refining concern said a major portion of the budget for fiscal 1990, ending July 31, is for the construction and installation of a 12,000-barrel-a-day reformer unit at Artesia, N.M., that will increase gasoline production capabilities and will substantially enhance production of higher-octane gasolines.
