Computer & Communications Technology Corp. said it expects to report a "substantial" loss for the third quarter as a result of a sharp drop in revenue. 

Everett T. Bahre, chairman and chief executive officer, declined to elaborate on the amount of the anticipated loss.
For the year-earlier period, the company earned $202,000, or two cents a share, on $30.9 million in revenue.
The company, based in San Diego, produces magnetic recording head products for computer data storage. 

Mr. Bahre said the loss involves operating difficulties due to "numerous component shortages" that have delayed delivery of finished products.
He said revenue will be below the $15.6 million reported for the second quarter, when the company had a loss of $345,000. 

Mr. Bahre said new orders have been strong and that results for the fourth quarter are expected to improve "significantly." He declined to elaborate. 

Computer & Communications stock fell 37.5 cents a share to $1.625 in national over-the-counter trading yesterday.
