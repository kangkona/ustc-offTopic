The U.S. said it will continue export controls on equipment used to make advanced composite materials, despite a report that such products are available to East bloc countries from other sources. 

Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, who announced the decision yesterday, said the U.S. will try to persuade those sources to restrict their sales of the equipment.
Under current trade law, the Commerce Department is required to remove export controls on products which have been found to be freely traded by other countries besides the U.S. and its allies, unless those countries agree to cooperate in restricting the availability of those products. 

The equipment, or so-called prepreg machines, is used to make a range of civilian and military products such as fishing rods and missile casings.
The U.S. exported more than $5.5 million of these machines from April 1988 to April 1989. 

The State, Defense and Commerce departments jointly recommended retaining export controls until the U.S. exhausts all other means of denying the East bloc access to the equipment.
Mr. Mosbacher said the equipment is of "strategic importance" because it could also be used to make sophisticated weaponry. 

The Commerce Department said export controls will remain in effect for six months while negotiations with the foreign sources take place, and for an additional 12 months if there is "progress" in these talks.
Mr. Mosbacher said the negotiations have a "reasonable likelihood of success." 

The department said the identities of the U.S. and foreign suppliers of this equipment are confidential.
