The Labor Department accused Chevron U.S.A. of more than 100 safety violations at the company's Richmond, Calif., refinery after an April fire that severely burned three employees.
The agency proposed fining Chevron $877,000. 

The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration alleged that Chevron knew, or should have known, about hazardous conditions at the refinery and that the company didn't make a reasonable effort to correct the situation. 

Most of the alleged violations consisted of failure to provide protective equipment and clothing to 109 employees who were expected to assist fire-fighting efforts. 

In San Francisco, Chevron U.S.A., which is the domestic unit of Chevron Corp., said it will "vigorously contest" OSHA's allegations and proposed penalties.
In particular, the oil company disputed OSHA's findings that it failed to provide appropriate protective clothing for employees involved in the accident. 

The fire started when a pipe carrying highly pressurized hydrogen gas separated at the weld, according to OSHA.
The resulting explosion and fire weakened a reactor, which breaks down crude oil into usable fuel.
The reactor fell and engulfed four workers in flames. 

OSHA said three of the workers weren't wearing fire-resistant clothing and suffered second and third degree burns over 70% of their bodies.
The fourth, a fire brigade member who was wearing protective clothing, escaped with only minor burns on his face. 

Chevron has until Oct. 17 to contest the proposed penalties with the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.
