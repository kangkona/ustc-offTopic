Addington Resources Inc. said it's considering redeeming $46 million in 8% convertible subordinated debentures due 2013.
The debentures were issued last year. 

The coal-mining company can call for early redemption of the debentures when the market price of its common stock has equaled or exceeded $19.60 a share for 20 of any 30 consecutive trading days.
As of the close of national, over-the-counter trading Monday, this had occurred.
