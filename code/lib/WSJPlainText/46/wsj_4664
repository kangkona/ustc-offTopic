Micron Technology Inc. said it had been sued in U.S. District Court in New York by a shareholder alleging the company violated federal securities laws and that certain past and present officers engaged in inside trading. 

Micron said the suit stems in part from "certain statements allegedly made by the company during the period from March 15, 1989 to July 18, 1989." 

The Boise, Idaho, semiconductor maker declined to provide additional details.
However, Micron said that based on a "preliminary review of the allegations" it intends "to defend the action vigorously." 

Micron's stock, owing to sagging earnings, has taken a beating on Wall Street, losing about 50% of its value since June.
Announcement of the suit came following the close of trading yesterday; Micron shares moved down 25 cents, closing at $13 a share in national over-the-counter trading.
