Nynex Corp. said it will resume contract negotiations with two unions to end a 7 1/2-week strike. 

The company said it will meet informally with the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers tomorrow morning.
Talks broke off with the CWA Sept. 15 and with the IBEW Sept. 17.
The CWA represents about 40,000 employees of the regional telephone company while the IBEW represents about 20,000. 

The two unions struck Aug. 6, and the sides still remain far apart on health-care provisions.
