Merrill Lynch & Co. exercised an option to acquire the remaining 50% in Tandem Financial Group Inc., an interest that Franklin Resources Inc. had been in discussions to buy. 

Terms will be based on the book value of Tandem, the largest supplier of annuities to Merrill Lynch clients, in mid-October, when the transaction is scheduled to be completed.
A Merrill Lynch spokesman estimated the price at $90 million.
Tandem has about $4 billion in assets. 

By exercising its option, Merrill will purchase the stake from Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., with which Merrill founded Tandem four years ago.
San Mateo, Calif.-based Franklin Resources, which has about $40 billion in assets and is one of the largest sources of mutual funds sold through Merrill Lynch, said it is ending talks with Equitable. 

The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals.
