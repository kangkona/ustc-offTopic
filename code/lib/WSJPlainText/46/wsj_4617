Concerning your Aug. 31 article about the defense industry, "Unsettling Specter of Peace Has Caused a War Among Analysts Over the Possible Consequences": 

The people who really should be speculating about Mikhail Gorbachev's "peacemaking" are our NATO allies.
Once American troops are returned to the U.S. and converted to Reserve units, neither the Navy nor the Army is going to generate a lot of business by sending them back to Europe should the Russian bear growl. 

Notwithstanding the obvious problems of returning troops to Europe across an ocean infested by Russian submarines, the political impracticality of calling up National Guard and Reserve units (remember the Berlin Wall?) almost ensures that our NATO "allies" will be going to the next war by themselves.
