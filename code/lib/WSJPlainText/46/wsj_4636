After a short hiatus, Sandra Kurtzig has returned as chairwoman of ASK Computer Systems Inc. Ms. Kurtzig, the founder of this maker of management-information software systems, also will assume the duties of president and chief executive officer, posts she also previously held. 

In those duties she will succeed Ron Braniff, who was named vice chairman and will remain a director.
Ms. Kurtzig had ceded the president and chief executive posts to Mr. Braniff in 1985. 

Ms. Kurtzig appeared to have severed all ties with ASK in February when she resigned as chairwoman, saying she wanted to pursue other business interests.
The company didn't return calls seeking elaboration on her return to top management. 

Although Mr. Braniff's tenure as president and chief executive was generally marked by revenue and profit growth, the company said earlier this month that slacking demand for its products would result in a decline in profit for its fiscal first quarter ending Saturday. 

For its fiscal year ended June 30, ASK saw net income grow 25% to $13.5 million from $10.8 million a year earlier.
Revenue rose 30% to $186.3 million from $142.4 million.
In over-the-counter trading, ASK was unchanged at $9.25 a share.
