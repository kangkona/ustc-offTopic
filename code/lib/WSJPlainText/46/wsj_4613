Morrison Knudsen Corp. is expected to unveil today the formation of a consortium proposing to build a high-speed mass transportation rail system capable of moving riders at more than 185 miles an hour between major Texas cities. 

Company officials would provide few details of the proposal, except to say that it involves application of rail technology pioneered in France, which has the fastest mass transit rail system in the world. 

Among the consortium members will be GEC Alsthom, a leading French designer of high-speed rail systems.
At least four other states, Ohio, Florida, California and Pennsylvania, are in various stages of considering high-speed rail systems.
Ohio's long-studied plan would connect the cities of Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati and has an estimated cost of $8 billion; a Florida proposal to connect Miami with Tampa and Orlando has been estimated at $2.2 billion. 

Morrison Knudsen is a construction and engineering concern with annual revenue of about $2 billion.
