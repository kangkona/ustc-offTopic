Patrick Watson, a prominent Canadian television figure, was named chairman-designate of Canadian Broadcasting Corp. Gerard Veilleux, a former senior government official, also was appointed president and chief executive officer of the government-owned broadcasting company.
Mr. Watson will serve as a member and special adviser to the board until Canada's new Broadcasting Act is passed by Parliament.
The new act provides for a chairman and for a president and chief executive officer.
Previously, the CBC had only a president, a position held by Pierre Juneau.
