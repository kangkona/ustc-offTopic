S&P Co., owner of the Pabst, Falstaff and Pearl brands of beer, said it will try to block the acquisition of Stroh Brewery Co. 's assets by Adolph Coors Co. 

S&P, the U.S. sixth-largest brewer, said it will file suit in federal court alleging that a combination of the two brewers would violate antitrust law.
The company also said it will participate in Justice Department hearings on the proposed merger. 

In Golden, Colo., Coors said it had no comment on S&P's plans. 

Coors has signed an agreement in principle to acquire most of the beer assets of Detroit-based Stroh for $425 million.
The purchase would give Coors the Schlitz, Stroh and Old Milwaukee brands, among others, and requires Justice Department approval. 

The acquisition would increase Coors's market share to about 20% from about 9%.
Currently, Anheuser-Busch Cos., St. Louis, has about 43% of the domestic beer market and Miller Brewing Co., a Milwaukee-based unit of Philip Morris Cos., has about 22%. 

"There are already two giants," said William Bitting, general counsel for S&P, and the acquisition "would take two second-tier brewers and make them another giant, creating an oligopoly." 

In a prepared statement, Murray S. Cutbush, president and chief operating officer of G. Heileman Brewing Co., a unit of Bond Corp Holding Ltd. of Australia, said he doubted that the merger would pass "rigorous antitrust guidelines," given the concentration in the U.S. beer market.
He added that Heileman is reviewing the issues raised by the combination with antitrust counsel and will "advance its position in the appropriate form at the appropriate time." 

A spokesman for Miller said the company doesn't plan any action to block the Coors-Stroh deal. "But we're still watching," he said.
Spokesmen for Anheuser didn't respond to inquiries about the company's position.
