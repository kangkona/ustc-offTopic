Missouri regulators and Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. reached a settlement agreement that forces the company to cut rates $82 million a year while allowing it to earn more profit and modernize an aging phone network. 

The agreement, reached after a three-month dispute, is bittersweet for the unit of Southwestern Bell Corp.
In June, the Missouri Public Service Commission ordered Southwestern Bell Telephone to cut Missouri rates $101 million a year -- the largest reduction in the state's history. 

At that time, the commission also rejected the company's plea for rate reform, jeopardizing its plan to spend $180 million to install digital switches in 112 Missouri communities by 1990.
Southwestern Bell filed suit to appeal the decision; it dropped the suit as part of the settlement. 

Dan Hubbard, an assistant vice president of Southwestern Bell Telephone, called the pact an "important first step" but said he viewed the commission's "rate reduction as a significantly negative element of the settlement." 

Under the accord, regulators approved an incentive regulation plan that will allow Southwestern Bell Telephone to maintain a 14.1% authorized rate of return on equity.
Southwestern Bell would be allowed to keep 40% of the earnings above the 14.1% level and 50% if the return on equity surpassed 14.5%.
But it won't be allowed to request a rate increase until 1993. 

Initially, the commission had cut Southwestern Bell Telephone's authorized rate of return on equity to 12.61% from 14.7%. 

In return, Southwestern Bell Telephone, which serves 1.9 million Missouri customers, will cut rates Oct. 1.
