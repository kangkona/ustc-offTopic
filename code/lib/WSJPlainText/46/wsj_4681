Meridian National Corp. said it entered a joint venture with Haden MacLellan PLC of Surrey, England, to build a $5.5 million paint-recycling plant here. 

Under the terms of the agreement, Haden MacLellan also acquired 750,000 shares of Meridian National stock, about 12% of the shares outstanding, for $1 million. 

The venture, Environmental Purification Industries Co., is expected to complete the plant in the spring of 1990.
William Feniger, chief executive officer of Meridian, said the venture plans to eventually build other recycling plants in different areas of the country.
