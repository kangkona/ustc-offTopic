Tyson Foods Inc., as expected, said it sold 82% of the common stock of certain Tyson units, including the flour milling and bakery divisions, to Delaware-based THF Inc., which is engaged in the leasing business. 

Both units were divisions of Holly Farms Corp., which was acquired by Tyson in July. 

Similarly, the Springdale, Ark., company also agreed to sell the remaining operating assets and related liabilities of both divisions to a unit of Decatur, Ill.-based Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., a processor of food ingredients. 

Terms weren't disclosed.
Among other things, the sale agreement with the unit is subject to regulatory approval.
