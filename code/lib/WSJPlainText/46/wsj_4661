Outboard Marine Corp. said it completed the previously announced sale of its Cushman turf-care equipment and industrial-vehicle business to Ransomes PLC, Ipswich, England, for $150 million. 

A spokesman for the marine-products concern said the sale will result in a gain in the fourth quarter, but he couldn't give specifics.
However, he noted that the book value of the operations was "in the range of $75 million or $80 million" at June 30.
