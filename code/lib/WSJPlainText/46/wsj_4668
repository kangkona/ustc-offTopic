Bear Stearns Cos., New York, said it formed a real estate asset management division, Bear Stearns Realty Partners, which will select and manage real estate investments for institutions. 

Wall Street securities firms have become major players in the real estate market as institutional investment has mushroomed.
Pension funds, for example, currently have about $72 billion deployed in real estate and that amount is expected to reach $122 billion in 1991, according to Greenwich Associates, a research firm. 

"This is essentially a joint venture between our asset management group, which manages $3 billion, and Bear Stearns Real Estate Group," which buys and sells properties, said Kenneth Rubin, a managing director.
Among its recent real estate transactions, Bear Stearns was a participant in the $150 million sale/leaseback of Marriott Corp. 's headquarters in Bethesda, Md., and the $150 million acquisition of Thanksgiving Tower in Dallas.
