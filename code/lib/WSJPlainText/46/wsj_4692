Kaneb Services Inc. said it expects to report a gain of over $100 million in the third quarter from the sale of a 33% limited-partner interest in its Kaneb Pipe Line Partners Limited Partnership. 

In the year-earlier quarter, the Dallas oil and gas exploration and development concern had a net loss of $13.2 million, on revenue of $17.5 million.
Results included a loss from discontinued operations of $1.5 million. 

Kaneb said it is offering the public about 4.7 million senior preference units of the limited partnership for $22 a share, while the company's Kaneb Pipe Line Co. unit, acting as the general partner, will retain about 67% of the partnership.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. will act as lead underwriter for the transaction. 

Kaneb common stock closed unchanged yesterday at $5.625 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
