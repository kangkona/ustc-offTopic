Alliant Computer Systems Corp. disclosed that it is in negotiations with Intel Corp. regarding a possible joint technology and licensing agreement that may include an equity investment of about $3 million by Intel. 

A spokesman for Alliant said the recent heavy trading in the company's stock may be attributable to these discussions.
No agreement has been signed, the spokesman said.
Alliant makes mini-supercomputers.
Intel makes semiconductor chips. 

Alliant's stock closed yesterday in national over-the-counter trading at $5.875 a share, unchanged.
