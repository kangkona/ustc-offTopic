Dow Jones & Co. began its previously announced $18-a-share tender offer for shares of Telerate Inc., an electronic financial information company in which Dow Jones owns a 67% interest. 

Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, last week said it planned to seek to buy the remaining public shares of Telerate in an offer valued at about $576 million. 

Telerate has named two independent directors to a committee to consider the proposal. 

The offer will expire Nov. 3 unless extended.
Dillon, Read & Co. and Goldman, Sachs & Co., financial advisers to Dow Jones, are acting as dealer-managers for the tender offer. 

Telerate's stock price in New York Stock Exchange composite trading closed 25 cents higher at $20.25; the shares have traded at around $20 since the Dow Jones announcement, amid speculation by analysts that the offer might be increased.
Telerate shares were trading around $15 before the offer was announced. 

Dow Jones has said that if its Telerate holdings reach 90% or more as a result of the offer or if the two companies negotiate an acquisition agreement, Dow Jones would acquire the remaining Telerate shares in a merger transaction for the same price. 

In addition to the Journal, Dow Jones publishes Barron's magazine, community newspapers and other periodicals.
It also operates electronic business information services.
