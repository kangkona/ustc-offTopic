The demand for advanced synthetic materials is burgeoning world-wide, but the U.S. lead in this market is threatened by longstanding weaknesses in education and manufacturing, according to a study by the National Research Council. 

Advanced composite materials, which have greater strength, sensitivity, and resistance to heat and cold than traditional metals, are now custom-built in laboratories.
This revolution in materials production can mean great opportunities for industry.
A very light airframe material, for instance, could spawn a new generation of commercial airliners whose sales eventually could total $45 billion, estimated the council, a part of the National Academy of Sciences. 

Much of the research underlying advanced materials has been done in the U.S.
But the U.S. edge may be dulling.
One problem is education.
College textbooks in advanced materials processing are poorly done, the report said, and the number of students studying materials processing hasn't increased in the past 15 years despite soaring demand.
U.S. colleges annually produce about 1,000 graduates with bachelor's degrees in materials-related departments, and about 700 with doctorates.
Moreover, the U.S. does a poor job in actually producing materials once they have been designed, the report said. 

Federal support for advanced-materials research totaled $1.1 billion in the year ended Sept. 30, 1987, the most recent year for which figures are available, the report said.
It said private industry spends at least that, and urged the government to raise its share.
