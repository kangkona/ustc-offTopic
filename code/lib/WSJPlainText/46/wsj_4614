The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved an American Stock Exchange request to trade a futures contract based on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes. 

The contract, the Amex's first venture into the futures markets in a decade, is designed strictly for big players.
Each contract represents a 10-year Treasury note with a face value at maturity of $100,000.
The Amex, which will trade the contract through its Amex Commodities Corp. unit, expects the contract to be used mostly as a hedging vehicle against the notes themselves. 

The contract is an attempt by the exchange to broaden its product line.
The Amex, which has ceded its once-strong position in stock trading to the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq over-the-counter market, has aggressively marketed its options contracts in recent years. 

The Amex has "been looking for greater respectability," said Perrin Long, an industry analyst at Lipper Analytical Securities Corp., New York. "Futures tied to more acceptable investment vehicles . . . over time help change the image to {one of} greater respectability." 

The Amex's contract will offer the new wrinkle of electronic order-matching, taking the contract out of the hands of brokers in pits who trade them on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The Amex contends that the electronic system will provide fairer pricing. 

The contract will be settled in the most recently auctioned 10-year note.
The Amex said it expects the contract to be used by primary dealers looking to hedge the risk of their inventory, by institutions that want to hedge against price movements of bonds they own, and by large customers who might want to speculate on the yield of the notes.
