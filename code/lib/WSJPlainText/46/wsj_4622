A federal grand jury here indicted a man accused of selling crack cocaine to an undercover federal agent in a ploy set up to provide a prop for President Bush's televised speech on drugs. 

Drug Enforcement Administration agents had lured the defendant, Keith Jackson, to a park near the White House to provide a prop for the president's contention that drugs can be bought anywhere.
The incident embarrassed the administration because drug dealing doesn't usually take place in the park. 

On Monday, the DEA said Mr. Jackson, who was charged with selling crack on other occasions, had disappeared.
The DEA attributed the disappearance to a report on the White House incident in the Washington Post.
But Monday night, the DEA tracked down and arrested the defendant, according to a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney here.
