The world semiconductor industry is expected to grow 9% to $49.1 billion by year end from $45 billion at the end of 1988, the Semiconductor Industry Association reported.
The trade group said world-wide semiconductor shipments will likely reach $64.8 billion in 

The U.S. market, after growing 9.7% this year to $14.7 billion, is expected to decline by 3.5% in 1990 to $14.2 billion.
However, U.S. semiconductor shipments are expected to gather steam again in 1991, growing 10.8% to $15.7 billion, and by 19.5% to $18.5 billion in 1992. 

The association attributed its growth forecasts to advances in technology that have resulted in "the growing pervasiveness of semiconductors" in a broad range of applications.
