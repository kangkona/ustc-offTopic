Your Sept. 6 page-one article "Japanese Women Rise in Their Workplaces, Challenging Tradition," on the falling barriers of sexual discrimination in Japan, implicitly compares Japanese and U.S. values regarding working women.
The unstated implication is that the U.S. is far more progressive.
Publicly, given its laws and rules of the workplace, the U.S. provides a more equitable environment for women who work.
Advertising to recruit Japanese-type "office ladies," for example, would be ill-advised and illegal in the 

Informal types of behavior toward women in the workplace, however, often reflect values similar to those in Japan.
The article cites Wakako Hironaka, the member of Parliament whose colleagues "frequently ignore her position and introduce her as the wife of a distinguished professor." This does not differ significantly from my experience of being addressed as the wife of a professor at Boston University -- even though I am both a professor and department chairwoman at the same school.
It is common at social gatherings for people to ask my husband his line of work, never thinking to ask his wife the same question. 

Comments and concepts that I have voiced, if found valuable by my colleagues, are promptly credited to a male co-worker.
This attitude seems more inadvertent than purposeful.
But it reflects underlying values.
Surprisingly, it is manifested by female colleagues nearly as often as by males, suggesting the same conservative stance in U.S. women as the article identifies in Japanese women. 

We in the U.S. should not yet flatter ourselves by claiming a progressive edge over the Japanese in the ungovernable private values and types of behavior affecting all women in the workplace.
