South Korean auto exports will be down sharply from earlier expectations, according to industry sources. 

The Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association predicted auto exports this year would reach 351,700 units, down 39% from last year's 576,134 units.
Local auto makers originally set this year's export target at 651,200 units, a 13% jump from last year. 

According to statistics from the Ministry of Trade and Industry, South Korea's auto exports plunged more than 40% during the first eight months of this year to 207,547 units, while domestic sales surged by 50% to 475,407 units. 

Similarly, auto production will rise only 7.6% to 1.2 million units from about 1.1 million units last year, the association said.
Auto output grew 63% in 1987 and 59% in 1986.
This year's growth rate is the lowest since 1981, with 8.1%. 

Labor disputes at major auto plants were blamed for sluggish production. 

A sharp drop in exports to the U.S. was cited as a major reason for sluggish exports.
South Korea exported 136,000 vehicles to the U.S. in the January to August period, less than half the 296,000 motor vehicles shipped a year earlier.
