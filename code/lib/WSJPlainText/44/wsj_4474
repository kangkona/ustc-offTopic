The Commodity Exchange, as expected, unveiled a new computerized order-entry device for floor traders. 

The hand-held computer, developed by Nynex Corp. 's IGS Information Services Inc. unit, would provide "tamper-proof" time stamping of trades and improve the exchange's audit trail, Comex officials said.
The system will be tested on the trading floor by the first quarter of 1990. 

Comex President Arnold Staloff said the exchange has been looking into electronic order-entry systems for four years, and was eager to introduce it "in light of what's going on in Congress and at the (Commodity Futures Trading Commission)." 

Pressure has been building for tighter trade reporting in the futures industry in the wake of the federal investigations into trading abuses at the Chicago and New York exchanges.
In August, the two big Chicago futures exchanges announced the development of their own electronic order-entry system.
Their system isn't expected to be up and running for at least a year. 

The new Comex system, which will cost $200,000 to develop, will "make detection of misconduct easier," said Robert Fink, Comex chairman.
But Mr. Fink said floor traders, who will bear the burden of this new system, will be "nervous about it," until they get used to using it. 

Traders would have to carry the small computer and the battery pack during the trading session and enter each trade upon execution.
The system will initially operate using diskettes that will be periodically collected during the trading session.
