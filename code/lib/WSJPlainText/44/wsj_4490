TRW Inc. said it formed a joint venture with Toyoda Machine Works Ltd., Japan, to produce in the U.S. hydraulic pumps and hoses for automotive power steering systems. 

The plant is expected to have sales of about $60 million and a production capacity of about 600,000 pumps and hoses a year by the mid-1990s.
It is slated for the Knoxville, Tenn., area, with a target completion date of late 1990, the company said. 

The plant will make the products for Toyota Motor Corp. initially, with plans to supply U.S. car makers later.
TRW said about $60 million is being invested in the joint venture. 

TRW is an automotive, aerospace, industrial and electronic products concern based in Cleveland.
Toyoda, a machine tool maker, belongs to an industrial group headed by Toyota Motor.
