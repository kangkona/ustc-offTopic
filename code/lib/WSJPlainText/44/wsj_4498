Washington Savings Bank said a default on $2 million of notes in its investment portfolio that were issued by Lomas Financial Corp. could negatively affect earnings for the year ended July 31. 

The thrift said it purchased the floating-rate notes in July, even though Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard & Poor's Corp. had downgraded the creditworthiness of the securities in June.
The thrift said it didn't learn about the downgrading until later. 

Dallas-based Lomas defaulted on the notes Sept. 1 and earlier this week filed for protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy law.
The notes are now trading at a substantial discount. 

Washington Savings still hasn't reported results for the year ended July 31.
For the prior year, the thrift reported net income of $1.1 million, or 81 cents a share. 

The thrift said it can't predict whether Lomas will be able to restructure its debt.
In the meantime, the thrift said it intends to pursue vigorously its claims against the securities firm that sold it the notes. 

In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Washington Savings shares closed at $1.50, down 37.5 cents.
