International Minerals & Chemical Corp., Northbrook, Ill., said it agreed to repurchase 1,013,500 shares, or 4.6% of its common stock from Curtiss-Wright Corp. of Lyndhurst, N.J., for $51.7 million. 

The company said the $51-a-share purchase, which represents Curtiss-Wright's entire stake, is part of its continuing stock repurchase program.
International Minerals said after the purchase, it will have about 20.9 million common shares outstanding. 

The maker of animal health and nutrition products said the transaction is expected to be completed within 30 days. 

Curtiss-Wright said as a result of the transaction, it expects to realize an after-tax gain of $10.2 million, or $2.04 a share, in this year's third quarter.
The projected gain includes extraordinary credits from a loss carry-forward. 

The aerospace and defense concern said that before taking the gain into account, earnings for the year will be comparable to 1988.
For 1988, Curtiss-Wright had net income of $28 million, or $5.62 a share, on revenue of $194.7 million.
