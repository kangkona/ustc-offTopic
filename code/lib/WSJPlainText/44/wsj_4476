EAC Industries Inc. said Peter B. Fritzsche resigned as president and chief executive officer, but will retain the chairman's post. 

The maker of hardware and printing supplies said Mr. Fritzsche will be succeeded by longtime director Daniel E. Virnich, a 48-year-old Denver businessman whose personal holding company has interests in manufacturing and real estate. 

Asked whether Mr. Fritzsche was asked to resign, Mr. Virnich said that the departure was "by mutual agreement." Mr. Virnich said it was his understanding that his predecessor intended to make an offer to purchase EAC, which for more than a month has been seeking a buyer.
While he reiterated today that EAC is proceeding with that effort, Mr. Virnich said, "We've got a lot of interested parties, adding that Mr. Fritzsche is "going to be in the same line with everyone else." 

Mr. Fritzsche couldn't be reached for comment.
