Toyota Motor Corp., in an aggressive bid to boost U.S. market share, is raising 1990 base prices on its most popular car lines by 2.5% or less from 1989 levels. 

Toyota's pricing, along with similar modest increases by other foreign car makers, doesn't bode well for American auto makers, analysts said. 

Foreign auto makers will boost their share of the U.S. car market to 41.5% in 1990 from 36.7% this year, said Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. 

Japanese auto makers raised prices substantially in 1987 and 1988, as the declining value of the dollar forced up the prices of imported goods.
But now, Japanese auto makers like Toyota have largely overcome that disadvantage.
Despite a recent drop, the value of the dollar has risen about 5% against the yen since a year ago.
Moreover, Japanese auto makers are increasingly protected from currency fluctuations because they are building some of their best-selling models in the U.S. 

Now, as they battle for market share on a more-level playing field, Detroit and the Japanese are pursuing sharply different strategies. 

The Big Three U.S. auto makers are boosting base sticker prices on most 1990 models by 6% to 8%.
But they are giving all or part of these increases back in the form of cash rebates to customers.
General Motors Corp., for instance, already has announced rebates of as much as $1,000 on certain 1990 models, even though the model year doesn't start officially until Sunday. 

But the major Japanese auto makers, as well as some European companies such as Volkswagen AG, are raising 1990 prices much less aggressively and signaling that they don't plan to rely heavily on rebates. "Our policy is that if the car is priced properly to begin with, you don't have to pay somebody to buy it," a Toyota spokesman said. 

If Japanese auto makers are forced into offering rebates to keep their U.S. factories running profitably, they now have more flexibility to do so, said Kidder Peabody & Co. analyst Jack V. Kirnan.
The Japanese can build cars in the U.S. for $500 per vehicle less than their Big Three rivals, Mr. Kirnan said. 

"It's just a question of who can cut prices faster and who can protect their margins, and it seems to me the Japanese have an advantage there," he said. 

Toyota said it is virutally maintaining 1989 prices on most 1990 versions of its compact Camry.
That model, which competes against the Honda Accord and some Big Three midsize models, accounts for 37% of Toyota's U.S. sales, and is now being built at a factory in Kentucky. 

For example, a 1990 Camry Sedan DLX with an automatic transmission will start at $13,078, unchanged from this year.
A 1990 Camry Sedan with a standard five-speed transmission will start at $11,588, just $100 more than the 1989 model.
The cheapest 1990 Camry equipped with a multi-valve V-6 engine will start at $13,698, up only $60 from a year ago. 

Toyota is raising prices most sharply on its cheapest car, the Tercel EZ.
That model will start at $6,488 for 1990, up $160, or 2.5%, from 1989.
