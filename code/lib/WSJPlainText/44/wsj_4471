Philips Industries Inc., which two days ago announced a proposed leveraged buy-out, named Joseph W. Deering, president of the company, as chief executive officer. 

Earlier this year, Philips said that either Mr. Deering or William McCanna, chief operating officer, would succeed Jesse Philips as chief executive.
Mr. Philips, the founder of the company, is retiring Oct. 23 on his 75th birthday. 

The company has also said that either Mr. Deering or Mr. McCanna would be named chairman, but there was no indication yesterday on who would fill that post. 

Mr. Deering, 49 years old, assumes the chief executive position immediately. 

Earlier this week, Philips board proposed a management-led $750 million leveraged buy-out.
If approved, Philips would merge with a unit of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc. 

Mr. Deering said the proposed buy-out expedited the chief executive announcement. "We're in a transition anyway, so it seemed like the timely thing to do," he said. 

Mr. Deering said the debt caused by the buy-out would force the maker of parts for building and transportation industries to curb future aquisitions and concentrate on existing operations. 

Mr. Deering joined Philips in 1985 as executive vice president of operations and has held a number of positions, including president of the Lasco Products Group.
