Chatter-Proofed 

From time to time, the words we speak 

May be delivered "tongue in cheek." 

But many times our words, by heck, 

Would best be uttered "tongue in check." 

-- G. Sterling Leiby. 

Good Copy 

I've canceled out my home for sale, 

But not because I'm mad. 

I've realized how great it is 

According to my ad. 

-- Ralph Shaffer.
