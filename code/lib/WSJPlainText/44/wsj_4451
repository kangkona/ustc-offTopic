Florida Federal Savings Bank and two of its former officers were named in a 43-count indictment charging the thrift with fraud in connection with government-backed student loans. 

The indictment, handed up by a federal grand jury in Tampa, Fla., charges that Florida Federal and the former officers attempted to defraud the U.S. of about $35 million by presenting false insurance claims on guaranteed student loans to the Department of Education in 1986 and 1987. 

The Department of Education, under the Guaranteed Student Loan Program, makes low-interest loans available to students to help pay for their education.
Lenders' funds are used; the federal government or a guarantee agency insures against any loss due to default. 

The investigation of Florida Federal began in early 1988 and helped trigger a management shake-up. 

Florida Federal's president and chief executive officer, John W. Sapanski, said the indictment "goes way beyond what is warranted and reasonable," adding that Florida Federal itself disclosed the initial problems.
He said the bank has been negotiating a settlement with the Justice Department. 

Named as co-defendants were Robert O. Harmas, 42, of Noblesville, Ind., and James J. LaMantia, 59, of Largo, Fla.
Neither could be reached for comment.
