Chase Manhattan Corp. said its banking branch in Chile was fined $3,750,000 by the government for violations of national foreign-exchange regulations and for exceeding legal-lending limits. 

A Chase spokesman said the bank believed it was acting in conformity with Chilean regulations, but that it agreed to pay the fine rather than go through lengthy litigation. "We consider the matter settled," the spokesman said.
