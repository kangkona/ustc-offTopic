After accounting for abnormal items, though, profit fell 2.8% to A$100.2 million from A$103.1 million.

Goodman Fielder earned an extraordinary profit of A$216.8 million in the latest fiscal year from selling investments, compared with a year-earlier extraordinary loss of A$4.6 million.
As a result, overall earnings jumped 222% to A$317 million from A$98.5 million.
