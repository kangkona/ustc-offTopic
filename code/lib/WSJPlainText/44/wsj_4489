Abbey National PLC., the first British building society floated as a public company on the London Stock Exchange, said six-month interim pretax profit edged up to #203.1 million ($328.9 million) from #202.8 million a year earlier. 

Abbey, which is now a bank instead of a thrift-like institution, said the pretax results were a little ahead of the forecast made of "not less than #195 million" at the time of its planned flotation in January.
The flotation was actually made in July. 

The results came amid a sharp deterioration in the U.K. housing market brought on by the high level of interest rates, Abbey said. 

Profit slipped to #132 million from #133.5 million.
Pro forma profit, which assumes the benefits of the share issue, climbed to #253.1 million, or 12.6 pence a share, in the latest half, compared with #237.8 million, or 11.9 pence, a year before.
