Japan's exports of cars, trucks and buses increased from a year earlier for the first time since March, inching up 2.1% to 446,614 units, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said. 

Association officials ascribed the gain chiefly to stepped-up shipments to North America, Europe and Oceania. 

The increase in August was the first since exports showed a 19% rise in March, totaling 547,798 units. 

Japan's auto exports were sluggish for some time because of slumping shipments to the U.S., where Japanese manufacturers have started production in increasing numbers and have made exports from Japan unnecessary.
