Cetus Corp., Emeryville, Calif., said it entered into a five-year research pact with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. aimed at developing anti-cancer drugs based upon Cetus's previous research into oncogenes.
Oncogenes are altered versions of normal genes that have been shown to cause cancer. 

Financial terms weren't disclosed.
Under the agreement, Hoffmann-La Roche, in exchange for sharing in research and drug development costs, will be awarded exclusive rights to market any resulting drugs world-wide.
Cetus, in return, will receive royalties on such sales. 

Oncogenes are present in an estimated 30% of all cancers.
By unraveling their role in cancer, Cetus scientists believe they can "establish novel approaches to the discovery of anti-cancer drugs," Cetus said. 

The collaboration is the second this year between the biotechnology concern and Hoffmann-La Roche, the giant Nutley, N.J., drug and health-care products concern.
In January, the two companies announced a similar pact to employ Cetus's gene-replication technology to develop diagnostic products for cancer, genetic disorders and certain infectious diseases.
