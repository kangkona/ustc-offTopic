Baltimore Gas & Electric Co., this city's biggest taxpayer, presented its annual tax payment to the mayor yesterday in a pomp-filled ceremony. 

Dignitaries postured.
Reporters scribbled.
Flash bulbs popped.
A check in the amount of $24,384,830.31 changed hands. 

But after the ceremony, the company quietly asked the city to give back the check. 

Why?
Explained Clare Miller, the utility's senior metropolitan affairs representative, "Because the taxes aren't actually due until Friday."
