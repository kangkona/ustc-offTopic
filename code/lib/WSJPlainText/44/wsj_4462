MDT Corp. said it expects sales and net income for the fiscal second quarter, ending Saturday, will be below first-quarter levels, when the company earned $811,000, or 16 cents a share, on sales of $26.7 million. 

In the year-earlier fiscal second quarter, MDT earned $1.3 million, or 25 cents a share, on sales of $25 million.
The company makes sterility-assurance systems and other medical equipment. 

J. Miles Branagan, chairman and president, said that recent efforts to boost production levels, sharply higher materials costs last fall and winter, difficulties associated with integrating a new product line, lower bookings and other factors "are expected to damp second-quarter results somewhat more than earlier thought." The company expects to post second-quarter results about Nov. 1. 

Mr. Branagan also said the company has been unable to make between $500,000 and $750,000 of shipments because of damage from Hurricane Hugo to its Charleston, S.C., manufacturing facility.
However, the company said that it expects damage to the facility and its contents was "minimal," and that power and communications should be restored within three weeks, with operations to resume shortly thereafter.
The Charleston facility accounts for about 12% of MDT's sales. 

In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, MDT shares closed at $7.75, off 37.5 cents.
