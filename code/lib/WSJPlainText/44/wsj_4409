Candela Laser Corp. said it agreed with Medical Care International Inc., a Dallas-based operator of outpatient surgical centers, to expand the pilot study of a joint laser-treatment program. 

Candela will add 15 vascular-lesion lasers to the five lasers already in Medical Care centers across the country. 

Candela said it will receive payment based on the number of procedures that are performed with the lasers.
