The House will likely vote today on the Democratic leadership's effort to kill a cut in the capital-gains tax.
President John F. Kennedy, Democrat, addressed capital gains in his 1963 special message to Congress recommending tax reductions: 

"The overall effect of all these changes in the capital-gain provisions affecting individuals and corporations will stimulate a freer flow of investment funds and facilitate economic growth. . . . The 'lock-in' effect of the present law, due to the ability to avoid all capital-gains taxes on assets held until death, will be eliminated.
This will result in a sharp increase in transfers of capital assets as individuals feel free to shift to the most desirable investment."
