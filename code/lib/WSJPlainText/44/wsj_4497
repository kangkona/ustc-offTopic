Kollmorgen Corp. said it filed suit against Vernitron Corp. for halting a proposed merger valued at $320 million. 

Kollmorgen, a Simsbury, Conn.-based maker of electronic, industrial and defense products, also said it approved a restructuring plan.
The plan could mean the sale of its electronic interconnections business segment, as well as certain other product lines. 

A spokeswoman for Vernitron, a closely held industrial electronics company, wouldn't comment on the suit.
It was Vernitron that first approached Kollmorgen about a merger in December. 

Kollmorgen and Vernitron agreed to the merger on April 30, and the accord was set to be signed by the end of this month.
But last Friday, Vernitron, based in Deer Park, N.Y., pulled out, citing "adverse changes" in Kollmorgen that it didn't anticipate. 

A Kollmorgen spokesman said the action by Vernitron "constituted a clear and willful breach of the agreement."
