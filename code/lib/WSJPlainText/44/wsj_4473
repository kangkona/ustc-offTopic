Bruce T. Teague, 36 years old, was named vice president in charge of marketing options products for the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, the latest change resulting from the departure of Arnold F. Staloff to the Commodity Exchange in New York. 

Mr. Teague's position is newly created, but the marketing duties had been handled by Joseph S. Rizzello, 42.
In July, Mr. Rizzello was named to head new product development efforts, succeeding Mr. Staloff.
Mr. Rizzello, an exchange senior vice president, also became president of the Philadelphia Board of Trade futures subsidiary, succeeding Mr. Staloff. 

Douglas Augustine, 36, was named to succeed Mr. Teague as managing director in Tokyo promoting exchange products in the Far East and Pacific Rim.
Mr. Teague also held the title of assistant vice president.
Mr. Augustine has lived in Tokyo since December 1985, most recently as a foreign-exchange dealer for Fuji Bank Ltd.
