Assets of money funds advanced by $1.5 billion, while average yields remained unchanged in the week ended Tuesday, Donoghue's Money Fund Report said. 

Total assets of the 390 funds tracked by the Holliston, Mass., newsletter currently stand at $343.2 billion. 

The average seven-day and 30-day compounded yields both remained at 8.6%.
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year. 

The average seven-day and 30-day simple yields were also unchanged at 8.26%, according to Donoghue's. 

Average maturity -- to some an indicator of where professional investors think rates will move -- was unchanged at 37 days.
Shortening maturities suggest higher interest rates on the horizon, while lengthening maturities hint rates will come down. 

Earlier this week, Banxquote Money Markets, an information service, reported that certificate of deposit yields rose slightly.
The average yield on a six-month CD was 8.04%, compared with 8.01% a week earlier. 

Those moves were partly a result of the higher yields paid on U.S. Treasury bills at the regular Monday auction.
The average six-month bill was sold with a yield of 8.22%, up from 8.06% a week earlier.
