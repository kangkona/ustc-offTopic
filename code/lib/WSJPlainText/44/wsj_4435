Armed with your "A Yuppie's Guide to Keeping What's Yours" (editorial page, Sept. 20) and the 1989 Statistical Abstract of the United States, I did a simple empirical test of New York Gov. Mario Cuomo's hypothesis that human behavior is not affected much by taxes since people do not even know their marginal tax rate anyway. 

From 1980 to 1987, 1,283,000 people moved (net of out-migration) into the nine cities listed on your chart that have no income tax, equal to 10.9% of their 1980 population.
Every single city had net in-migration in excess of 5% of the 1980 population. 

By contrast, for the 24 cities with a top marginal tax rate of 7% or more (for some reason, no migration data were available for Albuquerque), net in-migration was less in absolute numbers, and equaled less than 1.9% of the 1980 population.
The net in-migration rate was only one-sixth the level of the no-tax cities.
Some 38% of the high-tax cities had net out-migration (more moved out than in). 

Taxes do matter -- and people vote with their feet to prove it.
