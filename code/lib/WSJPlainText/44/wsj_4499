Puget Sound Bancorp said it will post a third-quarter loss of about $5 million after increasing its loan-loss reserves by $20.5 million to cover potential losses on real estate loans in Arizona and Alaska.
The Tacoma, Wash., bank holding company posted net income of $11.3 million, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. 

Puget Sound said the action was mandated by a recent downturn in the Arizona real estate market, where it has $57.6 million in commercial real estate loans outstanding, and in further declines in the Alaska market, where its loan exposure amounts to $48 million.
