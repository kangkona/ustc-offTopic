Southern California Edison Co., one of the nation's largest investor-owned utilities, said it signed an accord with black and Hispanic groups, promising substantial improvements in minority employment at the company's highest levels. 

The broad-based agreement calls for the company to increase female and minority representation among its top 100 managers to 20% by the year 2000 from 6% currently, and to 30% among its top 500 managers from 13%. 

Southern California Edison said it entered into the plan to better meet its long-term business goals.
The utility, a unit of SCE Corp., serves much of Southern California. 

Political analysts noted that the agreement includes a recommendation to California's Public Utility Commission endorsing Southern California Edison's proposed merger with San Diego Gas & Electric Co. Various San Diego groups bitterly oppose the merger.
Political support from minority groups may help convince regulators that the consolidation is, on balance, politically acceptable. 

Southern California Edison said it will make "a good-faith effort" to achieve each of the promised steps, which include an undertaking to boost its purchases from female and minority-owned businesses to 30% of its $1 billion annual supply and service contracts by 1998 from about 11%.
