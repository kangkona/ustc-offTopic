Argentina and the International Monetary Fund agreed on an economic program that will provide the country $1.4 billion in loans. 

The IMF lending is linked to the country's achieving mutually agreed-on targets for such economic indicators as its budget deficit and rate of inflation. 

The accord, which is to run until the end of 1990, is to be formally ratified by the IMF's board in coming weeks.
The money would boost reserves and help stabilize the economy. 

Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem told reporters early yesterday that the agreement had been reached.
This was confirmed several hours later by a person close to the IMF. Details of the agreement weren't disclosed. 

Mr. Menem, who was elected president this year, met yesterday with President Bush.
In a statement after the meeting, the White House said President Bush "noted President Menem's determination in dealing with Argentina's economic crisis and stated U.S. support for his program." 

Argentina's central bank president, Javier Gonzalez Fraga, who helped negotiate the IMF accord, had earlier outlined Mr. Menem's economic program to restore stability to the economy.
The program primarily consists of an orthodox anti-inflation strategy based on fiscal and monetary equilibrium backed by price and wage agreements; tax revision; greater independence for the country's central bank; and deregulation and privatization of state concerns. 

Argentina has arrears to foreign commercial bank creditors exceeding $4 billion and has had difficulty complying with IMF programs.
