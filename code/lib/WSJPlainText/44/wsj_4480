BCE Inc., a Montreal telecommunications, financial services, energy, printing and real estate concern, said it will issue 350 million Canadian dollars (US$297.6 million) of Series N preferred shares in a private placement expected to close by next Thursday.
BCE said the dividend rate is fixed until Nov. 30, 1994 at 7.55% a year.
After that the dividend rate will be determined by direct negotiations between BCE and holders, bids solicited from investment dealers, or by an auction procedure.
BCE said the preferred shares may be redeemed at par plus accrued and unpaid dividends from Nov. 30, 1994.
Proceeds will be used to reduce short-term debt.
RBC Dominion Securities Inc. is lead manager of the issue, BCE said.
