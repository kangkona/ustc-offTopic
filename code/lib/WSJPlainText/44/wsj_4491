Johnson Controls Inc. trimmed its profit estimate 5% for the year ending Saturday, citing a slowdown in the automobile industry, among other things. 

In July, the Milkaukee, Wis.-based seat and battery maker projected that fiscal 1989 profit would be flat compared with fiscal 1988 profit of $103.5 million, or $2.83 a primary share, generated on sales of $3.1 billion. 

In the wake of lower-than-expected seat sales to the automobile industry, a five-week labor strike at a battery plant and higher interest expenses, among other things, Johnson Controls said it expects 1989 profit to drop 5% from last year. 

Per-share earnings for the year will drop more than 5% because of the dilutive effect of an employee stock-ownership plan started in May, a spokeswoman said. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the company closed unchanged at $34.875 a share.
