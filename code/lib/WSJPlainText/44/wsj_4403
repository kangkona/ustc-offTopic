Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan said its U.S. compressor-manufacturing unit plans to build a $120 million manufacturing facility near Charlotte. 

The new plant will produce 1.5 million air compressor units a year beginning in April 1991, and will have 450 workers, the company said.
The compressors will be sold to U.S. air-conditioner makers. 

Matsushita said the factory will be Matsushita's 12th in North America, sixth in the past three years.
