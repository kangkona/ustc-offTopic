It's good to see acknowledgment that federal deposit insurance might be a source of the thrift crisis (Politics & Policy, Aug. 30).
The government's indiscriminate underwriting of deposits has had the perverse effect of drawing money to unsound financial institutions, which offer higher interest rates in a desperate attempt to crapshoot their way to solvency. 

Private deposit insurance would do two things to restore health to the financial-services industry.
First, it would base its rates on the quality of the portfolios of the institutions it was insuring, thereby imposing discipline on irresponsible operations (and driving some out of business).
Second, in order to evaluate portfolios, it would require market accounting. 

"Marketing to market" investment portfolios (as opposed to the archaic system of cost accounting preferred by timid federal bureaucrats) would in turn lead to sophisticated secondary markets for everything from home mortgages to Third World loans.
The awareness of the status of one's portfolio and the increased liquidity afforded by the new secondary markets would add substantially to the stability of our financial institutions.
