British & Commonwealth Holdings PLC said pretax profit fell 45% in the first six months of the year after an increase in good will amortization charges and the disposal of its big industrial services unit and one of its money-broking businesses over the past year. 

Pretax profit dropped to #34.4 million ($55.7 million) from #63.0 million a year earlier after a #25.9 million charge against good will relating to several recent acquisitions.
The company took a #19.9 million charge on good will a year earlier. 

Profit after taxes and minority interests tumbled by half to #15.8 million, or 3.8 pence a share on a fully diluted basis, from #31.2 million, or 7.2 pence a share. 

Profit attributable to shareholders plunged to #5.1 million from #120.9 million after accounting for preference share dividend payments and extraordinary items.
There were no extraordinary items in the latest period.
A year ago, the company took an extraordinary gain of #100.4 million on the sale of Bricom. 

Operating profit eased by 24% to #72.7 million from #95.3 million on a 36% fall in sales to #359.5 million from #566 million.
