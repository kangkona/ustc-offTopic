The fee that Medicare patients must pay for hospital care under the insurance plan for the elderly will rise to $592 in 1990 from $560 this year, the Department of Health and Human Services announced. 

Under the insurance plan for catastrophic illness enacted last year, a Medicare beneficiary must pay the $592 deductible for the first day of hospital care each year and Medicare pays for the balance of hospital expenses.
However, Congress is expected to repeal or significantly reduce the coverage, making hospital benefits less generous next year. 

The Health Care Financing Administration estimates that 7.6 million Medicare beneficiaries will enter hospitals next year and pay the higher deductible.
The fee is adjusted each year to reflect changes in hospital costs.
