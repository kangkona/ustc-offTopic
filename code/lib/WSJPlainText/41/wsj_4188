Japan's steel exports fell 2.8% in August from the previous month and were 11% below year-earlier levels, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation said. 

A federation official said the industry routinely sees a decline in exports in August because of summer vacations and the beginning of a fiscal year at some companies. 

The effect on exports of slower production is being magnified by high domestic demand for steel, he said.
Japanese steel companies are increasingly focusing on domestic sales, reacting to brisk demand and an unattractive environment for sales overseas, according to the official. 

August exports totaled 1,651,689 metric tons.
A metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds.
The average export price for each ton was $772 in August, down $8 from July. 

The average export price in yen terms fell for the first time in 16 months, the federation said.
In August, the average price for a ton was 108,200 yen ($769.29), down 2,200 yen from July.
In July 1988, the average price was 93,900 yen a ton. 

Exports to China rose 2.5% from July to 33,000 tons but were off 9.9% from August 1988.
The federation official said exports to China in July were seriously affected by international reaction against China's violent supression of pro-democracy demonstrations in June.
Steel exports to China in May totaled 379,000 tons. 

In other markets, exports to Taiwan rose 5.4% to 181,000 tons, compared with July.
August exports were down 3.9% from a year earlier. 

Exports to South Korea fell 15% to 124,000 tons compared with July and were down 27% from a year earlier. 

Exports to the Soviet Union fell 30% to 64,000 tons compared with July and were off 69% from a year earlier.
