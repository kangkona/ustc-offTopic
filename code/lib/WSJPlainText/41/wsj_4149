Gradco Systems Inc., Irvine, Calif., said that its founder and chief executive officer, Keith B. Stewart, is actively pursuing a possible management-led buy-out of the company, which makes office copier and printer parts. 

No proposal has yet been submitted to the board, however, and there can be no assurance that any transaction will occur, Mr. Stewart said. 

The company disclosed the plans after inquiries about an unusual run-up in its stock price last week.
In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Gradco shares closed up 87.5 cents at $18.375.
