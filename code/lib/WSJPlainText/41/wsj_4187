Silvercrest Industries Inc., Santa Ana, Calif., said it reached a non-binding agreement to sell preferred stock convertible into about a 24% stake to a private investor group and to give the group control of the company's board. 

A member of the investor group, Robert E. Killen, already controls about 8% of the company's more than 3.5 million common shares.
The group includes three other investors and a closely held company. 

Under the agreement, the group will buy 1,150,000 convertible preferred shares of Silvercrest for $1 each, convertible into common on a 1-for-1 basis.
Silvercrest said it plans to use the money for acquisitions.
Silvercrest also will give the group five of eight seats on its board. 

The group will put up a $100,000 refundable deposit upon execution of a stock purchase agreement.
Silvercrest expects the transaction to close in November. 

Silvercrest sold its mobile home manufacturing assets in May, leaving it with assets that primarily include receivables from mobile home parks and other real estate.
For the nine months ended March 31, it had a net loss of $2.1 million on sales of $48 million, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $586,000 on sales of $42.4 million.
