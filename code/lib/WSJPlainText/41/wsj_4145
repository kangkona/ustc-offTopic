Motorola Inc., Schaumburg, Ill., announced plans to eventually curtail emissions of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. 

The maker of electronic equipment and semiconductor chips joins a growing number of major companies seeking to reduce or eliminate use of the common but environmentally harmful compound. 

Motorola said it wants to eliminate CFC emissions at its plants world-wide by the end of 1992.
A spokesman couldn't immediately say how many pounds of CFCs Motorola plants currently emit every year. 

CFCs are widely used in the electronics and other industries as solvents, coolants and fire suppressants.
But their use has been linked to a potentially dangerous depletion of the Earth's ozone layer, and a 1986 international treaty calls for consumption and production of the compounds to be halved from 1986 levels by 1998.
