Westinghouse Electric Corp., in a continuing effort to withdraw from stagnant businesses, said it will sell for $370 million its remaining majority stake in an electrical transmission and distribution equipment joint venture to Asea Brown Boveri Ltd. 

The sale has been widely expected since last year when Westinghouse began forming joint ventures with foreign businesses in an effort to reduce its investments in ailing operations. 

"Both Westinghouse and Asea Brown have strongly indicated that this would happen," said Mark Altman, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. 

Westinghouse said it will receive about $370 million from the Zurich, Switzerland-based electrical-engineering giant for its 55% interest in the business.
Asea Brown owns 45% of the U.S. venture.
The deal will also include subsidiaries of the venture in Brazil and Argentina, which are jointly owned with Asea Brown, Westinghouse said. 

The joint venture, based in Blue Bell, Pa., will have 1989 sales of about $1 billion, Westinghouse said.
It has a total of about 10,000 employees at 25 facilities. 

Westinghouse is a defense electronics, electrical equipment, waste management, broadcasting and financial-services concern. 

Westinghouse said it will reap a total of $800 million from its involvement in electrical transmission and distribution equipment businesses.
The total includes the latest transaction, money received in forming the joint venture and the sale of its Canadian transmission and distribution business to Asea Brown in July. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Westinghouse closed at $67.50, up 75 cents.
