Kollmorgen Corp. said Connecticut Superior Court Judge Nicholas A. Cioffi issued an order temporarily enjoining Vernitron Corp. from pursuing any further proposals to acquire Kollmorgen. 

The order also enjoined Vernitron, a closely held industrial electronics company, from acquiring any Kollmorgen stock in violation of a standstill agreement between the parties.
The accord was reached as part of a merger agreement in April in which Vernitron agreed to acquire Kollmorgen, a Simsbury, Conn., maker of electronic, industrial and defense products, for $320 million.
But Vernitron pulled out, citing unexpected "adverse changes." 

The court's order Friday was issued pending a preliminary injunction hearing scheduled for Oct. 17.
James E. Swiggett, president and chief executive officer of Kollmorgen, said he was "gratified" by the court's decision.
Vernitron officials couldn't be reached for comment.
