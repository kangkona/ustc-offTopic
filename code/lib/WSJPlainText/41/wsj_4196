Ford Motor Co. 's aerospace division agreed to pay the government $200,000 to settle claims that the unit misallocated labor costs in manufacturing the Sergeant York Divisional Air Defense gun for the Army, the Justice Department said. 

The government had alleged that Ford Aerospace allocated certain labor costs to spare-parts orders for the air defense gun that should have been allocated to the production contract.
The claims arose from a government audit in 1984. 

Ford officials couldn't be reached for comment.
