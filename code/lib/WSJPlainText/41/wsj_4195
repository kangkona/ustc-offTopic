Unilever N.V. said it has an offer under way to acquire all the common and preferred stock outstanding of Jeyes Hygene PLC of the U.K. for #28.3 million ($45.6 million). 

The Anglo/Dutch consumer products group said it already has received irrevocable acceptances of the offer from holders of more than 65% of Jeyes common stock and 76% of the preferred. 

London-based Jeyes produces floor care and cleaning as well as general hygiene products for use in institutional and commercial premises. 

Jeyes's 1.7 million common and 4.4 million preferred shares are owned by several stockholders that include its management and employees, institutional investors and private individuals, Unilever said. 

Jeyes was spun off in a leveraged management buy-out in 1986 from Cadbury Schweppes PLC, a Unilever spokeswoman noted, saying that over the past few years, "in profit terms it has grown substantially."
