The public can expect to pay more for their airline tickets. 

Fare increases initiated about two weeks ago by American Airlines, a unit of Dallas-based AMR Corp., went into effect Friday throughout most of the country.
Unlike earlier actions in which carriers withdrew similar increases after rivals didn't follow, this move was matched almost immediately by carriers, and it's sticking. 

Fares increased on a mileage-based formula that varies according to the number of days before departure that travelers buy tickets: 14 days, $10 to $20 increases; seven days, $30 to $60, and two days, an estimated $50 to $80. 

As with most fare initiatives, carriers may pull back on increases in certain markets where a competitor balks.
