Waslic Delaware Co. II and its parent, Western & Southern Life Insurance Co., said they raised their stake in Star Banc Corp. to 8.5% of the common outstanding. 

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the two companies said they bought 348,000 Star Banc common shares from Aug. 11 to Sept. 19 for $24.25 to $25.875 a share.
The purchases bring their holdings to 2,442,405 shares, the filing said. 

Waslic is a Wilmington, Del., investment company, and Western & Southern is a Cincinnati-based life insurance company. 

The firms acquired the stock in the ordinary course of business and not to influence the control of Cincinnati-based Star Banc, the filing said.
Star Banc Corp. said it was aware of the increased stake and isn't concerned, saying Western & Southern has been a major holder for a long time.
