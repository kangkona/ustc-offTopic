ICN Biomedicals Inc. and Flow General Inc. said they signed a definitive agreement for ICN to buy Flow's biomedical businesses for about $41 million. 

ICN, which also will assume $25 million of Flow debt, said it expects to benefit particularly from the Flow operation's overseas sales.
Flow's biomedical operations include various reagents, drugs, and equipment for immunology, microbiology, and environmental work.
The operations had revenue of about $100 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1989. 

According to year-end results restated by Flow General, the biomedical operations had a net loss of $16.6 million in the latest fiscal year, of which about $10 million represented nonrecurring charges and expenses.
A spokesman for ICN, a biotechnology concern based in Costa Mesa, Calif., said the company expects to make the Flow operations profitable by efficiencies of scale and joint operation.
Flow, based in McLean, Va., has interests in defense work, electronics, and software.
