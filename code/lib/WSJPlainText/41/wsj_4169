Rosewood Financial Partners, an investment partnership controlled by a trust of oil heiress Caroline Rose Hunt, has offered to buy a 20% stake in First Executive Corp. currently held by I.C.H. Corp. 

But the partnership must first convince First Executive to waive for at least 90 days some restrictions on a standstill pact between First Executive and I.C.H. 

Fred Carr, chairman of First Executive, a Los Angeles-based insurance holding company, declined to comment on the offer, which was disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
I.C.H. officials couldn't be reached.
Louisville, Ky.-based I.C.H. has said that it wants to sell its First Executive holdings. 

Dallas-based Rosewood, which holds a 9.6% stake in First Executive, has said it isn't interested in pursuing a takeover, but wants more influence in the company to enhance shareholder values.
Buying the I.C.H. holdings would boost its leverage with management.
In Over-the-counter trading, First Executive closed Friday at $11.625 a share, up 75 cents.
