Interleaf Inc., a developer and marketer of electronic publishing software, said two companies have agreed to invest $15 million in the company. 

Interleaf will issue 2,143,000 shares of a new class of convertible preferred to the two firms, Advent International Corp., Boston, and Cie.
Financiere du Scribe, Paris, for $7 a share. 

Interleaf said the transaction will give Advent a 12% stake.
Each share will initially be convertible on a 1-for-1 basis into Interleaf common, subject to adjustment based on Interleaf's stock price. 

Advent will invest $12 million, and the French concern will invest $3 million. 

Interleaf expects to use the $15 million to purchase its French distributor, France Interleaf, in its fourth quarter ending March 31 for about $7 million.
The additional $8 million will be used for general corporate purposes, the company said.
