Devon Group Inc. said it bought back nearly 3.3 million common shares at $15 each in a private transaction with three of the company's founding shareholders. 

The graphic-arts company said it bought 2,216,739 shares held by Citicorp Venture Capital Ltd. and 671,995 shares held by Rhode Island Hospital as trustee for the Textron Collective Employee Trust.
Devon also said it bought 410,400 shares from Marne Obernauer, former Devon chairman, who continues to hold 410,400 shares, or 5.8% of the 7.1 million shares now outstanding. 

The company said it decided to purchase the stock because "of all the corporate opportunities we've looked at over these past many months, none seemed more promising than our own company." Devon also said it could improve per-share earnings and at the same time cause no reduction in the stock that is publicly held, because none of the repurchased shares ever traded publicly. 

Devon said Citicorp bought about 1.9 million warrants at 28.5 cents each to acquire Devon shares at $32 each for the next 18 months.
In over-the-counter trading Friday, Devon closed at $18.25, up $1.25. 

Devon said David F. Thomas, vice president of Citicorp Venture Capital, resigned from Devon's board, reducing the board to six members.
