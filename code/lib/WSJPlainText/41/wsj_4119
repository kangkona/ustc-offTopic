HAL Acquisition, a group headed by Peter V. Ueberroth and J. Thomas Talbott, said it will extend its $22-a-share tender offer for HAL Inc., parent of Hawaiian Airlines, if it can reach new work accords with the Honolulu-based company's unions. 

In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, HAL Acquisition, Newport Beach, Calif., said the extension of the tender offer, which was scheduled to expire tomorrow, was contingent upon obtaining union agreements and financing. 

HAL Acquisition is actively negotiating with union representatives and that for agreements to be "reasonably satisfactory," it wants five-year pacts with no wage increases for the first three years, the filing said.
HAL Acquisition won't require wage concessions but will require significant work-rule changes to permit more "rational and efficient" use of personnel to increase productivity 30%, the filing said. 

Among other things, these work-rule changes would require an increase of about 20% in actual flying time for Hawaiian Airlines pilots, the filing said.
HAL Acquisition said its goal is to produce savings of about $6 million over three to five years. 

The filing also said HAL Inc. would incur "substantial" additional debt in the next 12 to 18 months for working capital and equipment to support its business operations. 

If the labor negotiations are resolved, HAL Acquisition said it will extend its tender offer until after a special shareholders meeting.
It also said it expects senior management changes.
