Todd Shipyards Corp. said it applied to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to sell its Aro Corp. industrial equipment subsidiary as part of its plan to emerge from Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. 

Todd declined to say how much the sale of the Aro unit might bring.
It said that pending court approval, bids for the unit will be accepted through mid-November and then be evaluated by Todd's financial adviser, Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. Todd filed for protection from creditors in August 1987. 

Separately, Todd said a report by an independent consultant assessing the market for its shipyard operations concluded that its Galveston, Texas, shipyard "will continue to incur substantial losses" through fiscal 1992.
The report further concluded that beyond 1992, the "viability" of the shipyard would depend on securing repair work for Navy vessels to be stationed at a Corpus Christi, Texas, port scheduled to begin operations in 1992. 

Furthermore, for the shipyard to be profitable, Todd would have to invest in substantial capital improvements and "improve its operating performance by instituting new marketing and project management programs." 

Todd said the projected operating losses and underutilization of capacity at the Galveston shipyard raise questions about the value and "recoverability of recorded amounts of Galveston's assets." Todd also said that, were it forced to close the shipyard, related costs would be "substantial."
