Southmark Corp. and its National Heritage Inc. unit said they notified the Securities and Exchange Commission that they will be late in filing year-end financial results. 

Dallas-based Southmark, a real estate and thrift concern, said it has had to devote substantial personnel and other resources to bankruptcy-law proceedings since it filed under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in July, delaying completion of its results for the year ended June 30. 

For the nine months, Southmark had a net loss of $1.16 billion, including $800 million in write-downs and special charges, on revenue of $1.5 billion.
The company, facing a severe liquidity bind, sought protection from creditors while it works on a plan to restructure about $1.2 billion in debt. 

Southmark, which owns 62.5% of National Heritage, recently took more direct control of the manager of nursing homes and retirement centers after a lengthy battle with National Heritage management.
