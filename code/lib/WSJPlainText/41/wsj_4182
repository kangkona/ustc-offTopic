Resorts International Inc., the troubled casino company owned by entertainer Merv Griffin, said it has begun negotiations with bondholder committees on a recapitalization plan. 

The company said the New York law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue will represent holders of $600 million of subordinated debt.

The bondholders also seek the appointments of Ed Newman of Chemical Bank as investment adviser to the subordinated debt holder committee, and Wilbur Ross of Rothschild Inc. as head of the senior secured debtholder committee, according to people close to the company.
