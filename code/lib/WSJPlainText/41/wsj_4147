Olympia Broadcasting Corp., based in Seattle, said it plans to seek offers for its five radio stations.
It said the proposed sale is part of its previously announced strategy to focus on its "non-network business," including its Olympia Broadcasting Networks unit, which supplies sports, entertainment and other programs to 1,700 radio stations nationwide. 

The stations up for sale are in Kansas City, Mo.; Fresno, Calif.; Spokane, Wash.; and Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska.
Olympia said all sales are subject to regulatory approval.
The company didn't estimate a value of the properties.
