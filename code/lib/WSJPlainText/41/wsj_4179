Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association said Citadel Holding Corp., after two years of on-and-off moves to take over the thrift, said it is throwing in the towel. 

Samuel C. McCarver, Citadel's executive vice president, said the company wasn't interested any longer because the recent passage of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act had substantially boosted the capital requirements of the combined concerns. 

Dan Nelms, president of Valley Federal Savings, which has $3.3 billion in assets, said that "regardless of this action by Citadel, Valley Federal will continue to pursue its restructuring." 

The battle to take over the Van Nuys, Calif., thrift began when Citadel acquired options in 1987 for a 32% stake in Valley Federal.
Citadel later announced a hostile $18.50-a-share bid for Valley Federal, which was rejected by the Valley Federal board.
Citadel's options have expired, and it doesn't hold any Valley Federal stock, a Valley Federal spokeswoman said.
