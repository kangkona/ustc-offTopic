M.D.C. Holdings Inc., Denver, said it paid down $25.2 million of debt and negotiated a new credit line. 

Spencer I. Browne, executive vice president and general counsel, said the troubled home builder used "available liquidity" to pay off several lenders from the original credit line, including some failed institutions that had been taken over by federal regulators. 

The payment reduced the debt outstanding on the credit line to $5.8 million, which was then included in the new, $20 million credit line negotiated by a newly formed subsidiary with First Interstate Bank of Denver and United Bank of Denver.
The credit line can be increased to $35 million if additional institutions join the lending group, M.D.C. said.
Mr. Browne said the company already has drawn most of the $14.2 million of credit currently available. 

The new credit facility is secured by "a substantial portion" of M.D.C.'s Colorado home building and land development inventories, the company said. 

Recently, M.D.C. has been stung by an investigation into its accounting practices by the Securities and Exchange Commission and a string of quarterly losses that had some analysts speculating about a possible default.
The company recently settled the SEC dispute by adding an explanatory footnote to its 1988 results while neither admitting nor denying guilt.
