San Diego Gas & Electric Co. said it filed suit to get another regulatory hearing concerning $28 million in disallowed electricity charges. 

The suit, filed in federal court in San Francisco, challenges the California Public Utilities Commission's rejection of the company's petition to rehear a decision it issued in February against the company. 

In the February decision, the commission disallowed more than $28 million in past electricity charges by the utility.
In denying the rehearing this month, the commission maintained that some legal error in its decision must be demonstrated, "and no legal error was shown." The decision concerned certain power transmitted in 1984-86. 

Spokesmen at the commission didn't have any immediate comment on the suit.
