Petrie Stores Corp. said losses from Hurricane Hugo will significantly hurt third-quarter earnings.
It wasn't more specific. 

The women's specialty retailer said 100 of its stores were in the path of the hurricane and that five stores on St. Croix, Virgin Islands, were destroyed. 

Petrie didn't forecast third-quarter results.
In the year-earlier third quarter, Petrie had net income of $6.1 million, or 13 cents a share.
