Avon Products Inc. said it agreed to sell its Valentino fragrance business and the inventory of its Parfums Stern unit to Italy's Valentino Group for about $12.3 million in cash and notes. 

Avon, which wouldn't give sales figures for Stern, said Stern has marketed Valentino fragrances world-wide under a license from Valentino Perfumes for four years.
An Avon spokesman said Stern was a "not very large contributor" to Avon's profit.
Avon recently reported first-half net income of $45.7 million, or 51 cents a share, reversing a loss in last year's first half of $55.3 million. 

Avon expects the sale to be completed within a month.
It said it expects to realize a gain on the sale and that proceeds will be used to reduce debt.
