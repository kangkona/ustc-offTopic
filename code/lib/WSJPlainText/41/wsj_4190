August A. Busch Jr., the 90-year-old retired head of brewing giant Anheuser-Busch Cos., died Friday. 

Mr. Busch controlled a 12.5% stake in the world's largest brewer, and trading in the company's stock was halted pending disclosure of his death. 

However, early speculation that Mr. Busch's approximately 35.4 million shares, once they were in the hands of his heirs, might flood the market and depress Anheuser-Busch share price apparently was unfounded.
The company said that under a previously approved accord between it and the Busch family, the shares can be sold only through an underwritten public secondary offering. 

The purpose of the agreement, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1987, "is to provide a mechanism for the orderly sale of Anheuser-Busch stock by family members who inherit or receive shares from trust funds previously administered by Mr. Busch Jr.," the company said. 

Mr. Busch "fully endorsed" the agreement, which the company said "affords maximum protection for all shareholders of Anheuser-Busch stock." 

In composite New York Stock Exchange trading Friday, Anheuser-Busch shares ended at $43.375, up $1.125, giving his stake an indicated value of $1.54 billion. 

Mr. Busch, the third generation of his family to head the brewing concern, began his career with the company in 1922.
In 1975, he stepped down as chairman and chief executive officer, to be succeeded by his son, August A. Busch III.
