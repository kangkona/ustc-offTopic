Your James P. Sterba thought that our James P. Sterba was an impostor? ("Will the Real Jim Please Stand Up?" Leisure & Arts, Sept. 27.) How preposterous] I always thought your Sterba was the charlatan. 

But wait, perhaps the two Sterbas are one and the same.
Or are they two manifestations of the one?
But that gets too philosophical, and since there are no libraries in New York City either, who can solve the riddle of the two Sterbas? 

Seems to me, empirical verification is indeed needed.
