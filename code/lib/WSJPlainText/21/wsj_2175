A surge in sales in August helped trim inventory levels of U.S. businesses, Commerce Department figures show. 

Sales at factories, retailers and wholesalers jumped 3.1% in August, the department reported, far outstripping a 0.3% climb in inventories.
As a result, inventories fell back to the equivalent of 1.5 months of sales.
Inventories had been running at about this level -- one that economists regard as manageable -- for much of the year before they jumped to 1.54 months in July. 

The numbers are reassuring news for the economy.
If goods on shelves and backlots pile up too high, retailers often cut back on orders and factories on production.
The chain reaction can lead to layoffs and ultimately a recession. 

In July, business inventories had climbed 0.9%, a number the department revised from its initial report of 0.6%.
Sales, meanwhile, dropped 0.9%. 

In August, business inventories totaled $789.87 billion, while sales grew to $526.79 billion, the department said. 

Manufacturers showed the biggest sales gains; their sales rose 5.6%, while factory inventories only grew 0.3%.
Retailers' sales increased 0.7%, as did their inventories.
Wholesalers' sales climbed 1.5%, while their inventories dropped 0.1%. 

Here is a summary of the Commerce Department's report on business inventories and sales in in August.
The figures are in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted:
