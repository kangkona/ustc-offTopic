Helionetics Inc. said it agreed to team with a unit of Minneapolis-based Honeywell Inc. to provide power amplifiers for a new military sonar system being proposed by Honeywell. 

Total value of the contract could be $100 million, Helionetics said, and work on the project would be about evenly divided. 

As previously reported, Helionetics emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection in February.
