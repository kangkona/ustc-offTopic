UGI Corp. said its AmeriGas subsidiary completed the previously announced sale of its air separation plant and related assets in Waukesha, Wis., to AGA Gas Inc., Cleveland.
The price wasn't disclosed. 

The transaction is part of UGI's continuing program to shed AmeriGas's industrial gas interests and expand the subsidiary's propane business.
Since June, AmeriGas has netted more than $100 million from industrial gas divestitures and reinvested more than $50 million to acquire three propane distributors. 

UGI is a gas and electric utility and distributes propane nationally through its AmeriGas subsidiary.
