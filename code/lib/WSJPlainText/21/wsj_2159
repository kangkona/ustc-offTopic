Hydro-Quebec said it notified Central Maine Power Co. it will cancel a $4 billion contract to supply electricity to the Maine utility. 

The provincially owned utility said it is tearing up the deal because "the contract's objectives can't be fulfilled." Hydro-Quebec said Maine regulators' refusal to approve the contract earlier this year halted work on transmission lines and stopped negotiations for resale of electricity carried through Maine to other utilities. "It would now be physically impossible to begin deliveries in 1992," a Hydro-Quebec official said.
The contract was to run from 1992 to 2020. 

Under the contract Hydro-Quebec was to supply 400 megawatts of power to Central Maine Power starting in 1992, 600 megawatts starting in 1995 and 900 megawatts starting in 

Hydro-Quebec said Maine regulators' refusal to approve the contract means Central Maine Power has lost its place in line. "We won't sign any new contracts {with deliveries} beginning earlier than 2000," the Hydro-Quebec official said.
He said Hydro-Quebec already has some "customers in mind" for the power that was to be delivered to Maine. "Nothing has happened since we signed the contract to undermine our conviction that Hydro-Quebec was the lowest-cost, most environmentally acceptable choice for meeting a part of our customers' energy needs through the year 2020," said Central Maine senior vice president Donald F. Kelly. 

Central Maine said it is evaluating "many energy options" to make up for the lost future power, including new energy generation and management proposals from New England, and possibly new Canadian purchases.
