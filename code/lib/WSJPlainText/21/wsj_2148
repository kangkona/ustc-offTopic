TRW Inc. reported a 12% decline in third-quarter net income, but the company said that excluding unusual gains in both quarters, operating profit rose 16%. 

The electronics, automotive and aerospace concern said third-quarter net was $60 million, or 98 cents a share, down from $68 million, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier.
Share earnings are reported on a fully diluted basis, by company tradition. 

Results for the 1988 quarter included a gain of $1.05 a share from sale of the Reda Pump and Oilwell Cable units, partly offset by a charge of 69 cents a share for recall of faulty truck steering systems.
The latest quarter included a gain of 11 cents a share as a partial reversal of the recall charge, because the reserve established last year exceeded the actual recall costs. 

Sales for the quarter rose 8.3% to $1.79 billion, from $1.65 billion, with all three major product groups reporting gains. 

The company said aerospace and defense sales were up 2% for the quarter to $802 million, and operating profit climbed 6% to $61 million, mainly because of improved program performance in spacecraft and advanced-technology contracts. 

Automotive sales jumped 16% to $791 million, mainly because of higher sales of air bags and other passenger restraint systems, TRW said.
The group had an operating profit of $65 million, against a loss of $13 million a year earlier.
However, excluding the year-earlier charge for recall of steering gear, operating profit in the latest quarter declined 14%, reflecting higher start-up and product development expenses in passenger-restraint systems.
Materials and production costs also rose, TRW said. 

The information systems segment had a 44% jump sales to $196 million.
An acquisition accounted for half the sales rise, TRW said.
Operating profit rose threefold to $18 million, from $6 million. 

For the nine months, TRW's net was $199 million, or $3.22 a share, down 3% from $205 million, or $3.33 a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose 2.9% to $5.42 billion, from $5.27 billion.
