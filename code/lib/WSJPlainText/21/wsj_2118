CAE Industries Ltd. said its Link Flight Simulation division was awarded a contract by the U.S. Army for two helicopter simulators, which the company valued at as much as 37 million Canadian dollars (US$31.5 million). 

CAE said the fixed price for the first of the AH-64 Apache combat mission simulators is C$19 million.
It is scheduled for delivery in late 1991.
The price of the second simulator ranges between C$16.4 million and C$18 million, CAE said, depending on when the Army exercises its option. 

CAE is a Toronto-based maker of commercial and military aircraft simulators and training equipment.
