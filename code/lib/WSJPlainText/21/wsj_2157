President Bush chose Martin Allday, a longtime friend from Texas, to be chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 

Mr. Allday would succeed Martha Hesse, who is resigning.
The White House said Ms. Hesse, a Chicago businesswoman who previously held posts at the Energy Department and FERC, is leaving to become a vice president of First Chicago Corp. 

Mr. Allday, an attorney in Midland, Texas, has been solicitor at the Interior Department.
He met Mr. Bush in the 1950s, when the president was a young oil man in Midland and Mr. Allday was a lawyer for an oil firm. 

The FERC is a five-member commission that regulates billions of dollars of interstate wholesale energy transactions.
Mr. Allday's appointment is subject to confirmation by the Senate.
Administration officials said a date for Ms. Hesse's departure hasn't been set.
