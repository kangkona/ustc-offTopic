Bay Financial Corp., hurt by high debts and deteriorating real estate investments, reported a wider loss for the fourth quarter and said it might be forced to seek a bankruptcy-court reorganization if it can't renegotiate its borrowings. 

Bay said a "substantial part" of its debt outstanding is in default as a result of inability to sell certain properties quickly and lower-than-expected prices for sales made.
The company said its real estate portfolio is "highly leveraged," while about two-thirds of its investments aren't income-producing.
Thus it is coming up short on a big bet that quick sales at higher prices would enable it to keep up with mortgage and other debt payments. 

According to its latest annual report, about a quarter of the company's holdings are in Massachusetts, in the midst of a real-estate slump. 

The company said it had a net loss in its fourth quarter ended June 30 of $36.2 million, or $9.33 a share, on revenue of $13.1 million.
A year earlier, the company had a loss of $10.8 million, or $3.04 a share, on revenue of $10.8 million.
For the year, it had a net loss of $62 million, or $15.97 a share, on revenue of $44.3 million.
In the previous year, it had a loss of $22.5 million, or $6.52 a share, on revenue of $41.1 million. 

Although it is having serious cash-flow problems, Bay said the fair-market value of its holdings, minus debt, was equal to $6.02 a share at June 30 based on a recent appraisal.
Book value per share, which is based on investments at cost, was a negative $6.69 a share.
A year earlier, fair-market value per share was $26.02 and book value was $9.43 a share.
