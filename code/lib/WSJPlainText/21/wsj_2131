MLX Corp. said it reached a preliminary agreement with senior lenders to its refrigeration and air-conditioning group to restructure the $188.5 million of credit facilities the lenders provide to the group. 

MLX, which also makes aircraft and heavy-duty truck parts, said the debt was accumulated during its acquisition of nine businesses that make up the group, the biggest portion of which was related to the 1986 purchase of a Hillman Co. unit. 

Among other things, the restructured facilities will substantially reduce the group's required amortization of the term loan portion of the credit facilities through September 1992, MLX said.
Certain details of the restructured facilities remain to be negotiated.
The agreement is subject to completion of a definitive amendment and appropriate approvals. 

William P. Panny, MLX chairman and chief executive, said the pact "will provide MLX with the additional time and flexibility necessary to complete the restructuring of the company's capital structure." 

MLX has filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering a proposed offering of $120 million in long-term senior subordinated notes and warrants.
