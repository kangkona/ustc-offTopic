Sony Corp. won a pretrial order blocking U.S. sales of Justin Products Inc. 's "My Own" line of portable audio players for children. 

Judge John E. Sprizzo issued the order in Manhattan federal court, where Sony has accused the tiny company of illegally knocking off the "My First Sony" line.
The judge held that the combination of colors used for the Sony products is distinctive and subject to protection under New York state law, rather than federal law.
The legal fight was the subject of a Wall Street Journal story yesterday. 

Justin's attorney, Charles E. Baxley, said Justin would ask an appeals court to set aside the order temporarily, pending an expedited appeal.
He also repeated Justin's denial of Sony's charges. 

"Their likelihood of reversing us is very slim," said Lewis H. Eslinger, Sony's attorney, who said he doubts Justin will go ahead with a trial.
