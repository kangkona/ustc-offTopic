BRIDGEPORT, Conn. - Christopher Kimball, founder, president and publisher of Cook's magazine, said he is leaving the magazine by year end to launch a new men's consumer magazine. 

The new magazine, whose name Mr. Kimball won't reveal, will be a service magazine "at its core," covering subjects such as health, clothing, food, travel and gifts for women.
Mr. Kimball said he will launch the magazine as a bi-monthly in September 1990 with 250,000 circulation.
Mr. Kimball said he will be a partner in the magazine with an "experienced" editor, whose name will be revealed later. 

Mr. Kimball started Cook's, a glossy epicurean magazine, in 1979 and it was purchased in 1983 by the New Yorker Magazine.
The New Yorker's parent, Advance Publications Inc., sold it to Sweden's Bonnier Magazine Group in 1986.
The magazine is now published by Pennington Publishing, a subsidiary of Bonnier based in Bridgeport, Conn.
It has 200,000 circulation.
