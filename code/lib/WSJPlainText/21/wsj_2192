Louisiana-Pacific Corp. and Pope & Talbot Inc. posted strong third-quarter profit gains, citing continued strong demand and firm prices in the forest-products business. 

Louisiana-Pacific reported a 40% increase in net income to $51.5 million, or $1.34 a share, from $36.8 million, or 97 cents a share, the year earlier.
Sales in the period increased about 10% to $510.1 million from $462.9 million. 

Harry A. Merlo, chairman and president, credited strong demand for plywood and other building products.
The record results came despite a decline in operating results for the company's pulp business, he added.
This was due in large measure to a drought-related production curtailment at its Ketchikan, Alaska, pulp mill. 

For the nine months, the company posted a 34% gain in net to $139.8 million, or $3.66 a share, from $104.1 million, or $2.73 a share.
The company said it had an 11% sales increase to $1.50 billion from $1.35 billion the year earlier. (The company's 1988 results don't include a non-recurring gain on the final settlement of the Redwood National Park condemnation in 1988's first quarter.) 

Pope & Talbot said healthy demand and prices, especially for consumer products, led to a 55% increase in third-quarter net to $13.2 million, or $1.11 a share, from $8.5 million, or 71 cents a share.
The 1989 results include a gain of $3.5 million, or 29 cents a share, on the sale of a sawmill.
Sales in the quarter rose 20% to $162.1 million from $135.3 million. 

For the nine months, the company posted profit of $33.8 million, or $2.86 a share, including the gain on the sawmill's sale.
That was up 45% from $23.3 million, or $1.95 a share, the year earlier.
Nine-month sales grew 26% to $471.1 million from $373 million. 

Looking ahead, Pope & Talbot said it expects all of 1989 to be a record year.
Louisiana-Pacific said fourth-quarter performance is usually hampered by weather-related construction slowdowns, but that "many positive factors" should help the period's results.
