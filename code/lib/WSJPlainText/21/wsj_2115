CREATIVE ACCOUNTING, mostly by conglomerates, forced CPAs to change their way of setting standards to be followed by corporations reporting financial results, standards that had become all too flexible. 

The new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) was created in 1972 to replace the Accounting Principles Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
All of the former board's members were CPAs, provoking conflict-of-interest criticism because they were writing rules while handling clients' books at the same time. 

The new board's seven-member structure kept four CPAs, but the others were from industry and academia. 

Francis M. Wheat, a former Securities and Exchange Commission member, headed the panel that had studied the issues for a year and proposed the FASB on March 30, 1972.
The former board had produced "21 opinions and 1,000 critics" in its 12-year life, its chairman had conceded. 

The climate was right for the new FASB.
In the late 1960s some CPAs failed to correct such abuses as clients picking permissive rules that hyped earnings and stock prices.
And in November 1970 Congress had passed a special act to overrule one board rule.
Also, James Needham, an SEC commissioner, in April 1972 had warned that the industry might face a "federal agency writing accounting rules" if they rejected the FASB idea.
Keepers of the books, dubbed "figure filberts," loathed the threat. 

The FASB had its initial meeting on March 28, 1973.
On Dec. 13, 1973, it issued its first rule; it required companies to disclose foreign currency translations in U.S. dollars.
The FASB since then has issued 102 rules, and some still rile industry.
Since late 1987, for example, it has put off a rule dealing with deferred income taxes because of the continuing controversy over the issue.
