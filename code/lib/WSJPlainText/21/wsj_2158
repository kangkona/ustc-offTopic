CALIFORNIA REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT Corp. said its directors declared a dividend of five cents per Class A common stock payable Nov. 6 to stock of record Oct. 16.
The dividend represents the balance of its regular quarterly payout of 10 cents a share, of which half was paid July 17 in a final distribution prior to its merger with B.B. Real Estate Investment Corp., also in July.
The company said it hopes to resume its schedule of regular quarterly dividends at the end of this year.
