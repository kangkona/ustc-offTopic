NATIONAL INCOME REALTY TRUST said it will resume dividend payments with a 12-cent-a-share dividend to be paid Nov. 6 to shares of record Oct. 25.
The mortgage and equity real estate investment trust last paid a dividend on Aug. 1, 1988, when holders received 75 cents a share.
Despite continuing troubles with problem properties and nonperforming loans, the Dallas trust said it has rebuilt reserves, abandoned properties with little potential and experienced improved operating results from joint ventures.
