Some nervous market makers in Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks lowered prices severely at the start of trading in response to Friday's sell-off.
The markdowns were excessive, some traders groused, and indeed the market closed lower despite heavy buying of its leading technology stocks. 

After plummeting nearly 19 points almost immediately after trading began, the Nasdaq Composite Index staged a comeback, but still closed off 6.31, or 1.4%, at 460.98. 

Volume was an astonishing 242.8 million shares, 33% more than the turnover on May 19, which had been this year's busiest day. 

Many observers said yesterday afternoon that the price-slashing by some market makers during the last hour of trading Friday and before the market opened yesterday was overdone.
It was, they said, a factor in why the market didn't rally as strongly as the biggest New York Stock Exchange issues.
The Dow Jones industrials rose 3.4%. "Bids were lowered too much," said Gary Rosenbach, a market maker and manager of equity trading at Needham & Co. 

On Friday, the market makers, who must be prepared to buy stock when no one else will, were frantically cutting the prices at which they would take stocks off sellers' hands, in reaction to plunging prices on the New York Stock Exchange, according to Mr. Rosenbach. 

Yesterday, they again lowered their bids before trading began, in anticipation of another wave of selling.
Joseph Hardiman, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees trading on Nasdaq, said that between 9 a.m. and 9:30 a.m., the market's Small Order Execution System was deluged with six times the normal volume of quotation updates from market makers and had to be shut down for nearly 25 minutes after trading began so computers could digest the data. 

Mr. Hardiman said the system received about 102,000 updated quotes by 10 a.m., compared with 20,000 normally.
He said total volume on the system, used for trades of 1,000 shares or less by non-professional investors, was 2.5 times busier than usual.
But, Mr. Hardiman wasn't complaining. "It meant that market makers were dynamically updating their quotes, rather than sitting there frozen." 

Market makers defended their actions.
They said it was reasonable to expect a rash of selling and to lower prices in anticipation of it. "Market makers saw sell orders first and that's why they (lowered bids)," said Brian Finnerty, a Shearson Lehman Hutton market maker. "The buyers sat back and didn't come in until a half hour or 45 minutes later." 

E.E. "Buzzy" Geduld, president of Herzog, Heine, Geduld, a giant market-making firm, said, "Stocks looked ugly at 9:30.
It was shades of October 1987 until it turned and stabilized at about 11:30.
Nobody made a fortune on this market." 

Some of the biggest stocks were snapped up by bargain hunters and fared much better.
Intel rose 1 1/4 to 33 on 3.7 million shares.
Tele-Communications gained 1 to 19 5/8 on 3.7 million shares.
MCI Communications added 1 1/2 to 45 on 5.6 million shares.
Apple Computer advanced 1 to 46 3/4 on 3.8 million shares.
Microsoft jumped 2 1/4 to 75 3/4 on 1.8 million shares.
But Sun Microsystems eased 1/4 to 17 1/4 on 3.6 million shares and Lotus Development was unchanged at 29 7/8. 

The result was that the Nasdaq 100 Index of the big non-financial issues rose 0.56, to 449.89.
The biggest financial issues, tracked by the Nasdaq Financial Index, weren't as popular, falling 6.90, to 456.08. 

There was some favorable takeover news, in stark contrast to Friday, when nervousness about the future of leveraged buy-outs hurt takeover-related issues. 

National Pizza said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Skipper's for $11.50 a share.
The company said the acquisition, valued at about $31.3 million, is subject to the condition that at least two-thirds of the Skipper's shares outstanding are tendered. 

National Pizza also said it settled its dispute with PepsiCo's Pizza Hut unit that had threatened to scuttle the proposed acquisition.
Skipper's rose 1/2 to 11 and National Pizza was unchanged at 17. 

Among other takeover-related issues, LIN Broadcasting fell 2 3/4 to 104 3/4.
McCaw Cellular Communications, a LIN suitor, rose 1 1/4 to 41 1/4. 

The biggest percentage advancer was Grayhound Electronics, which jumped 73%, or 7 3/8, to 17 1/2.
The stock rose after Grayhound said it agreed to enter into a five-year joint venture with Lermer Corp., a maker of airline-interior equipment.
