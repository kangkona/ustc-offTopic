Alpine Group Inc. revised its exchange offer for $43.7 million face amount of 13.5% senior subordinated debt due 1996 and extended the offer to Oct. 27 from Oct. 12. 

The Hackensack, N.J., company said holders would receive for each $1,000 face amount, $750 face amount of a new issue of secured senior subordinated notes, convertible into common stock at an initial rate of $6.50 a share, and 50 common shares.
The new notes will bear interest at 5.5% through July 31, 1991, and thereafter at 10%. 

Under the original proposal, the maker of specialty coatings and a developer of information-display technologies offered $400 of notes due 1996, 10 common shares and $175 in cash for each $1,000 face amount. 

Completion of the exchange offer is subject to the tender of at least 80% of the debt, among other things.
Alpine, which said it doesn't plan to further extend the offer, said it received $615,000 face amount of debt under the original offer.
