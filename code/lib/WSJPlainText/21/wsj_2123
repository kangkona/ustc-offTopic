Reynolds Metals Co. said third-quarter net income dropped nearly 10% to $123.7 million, or $2.10 a share, from $137.2 million, or $2.56 a share, a year earlier.
The latest earnings reflect an increase of about 5.5 million in common shares outstanding.
Revenue rose 3% to $1.52 billion from $1.48 billion. 

Reynolds is the third big aluminum company since Friday to report disappointing earnings.
The No. 1 domestic aluminum producer, Aluminum Co. of America, Friday said its earnings fell 3.2% to $219 million, or $2.46 a share.
And Alcan Aluminium Ltd. yesterday reported net income slid 30% to $180 million, or 77 cents a share, from $258 million, or $1.07 a share.
Analysts on average had been expecting about $2.70 for Alcoa and $1 for Alcan. 

"It's a good indication that level of profitability has peaked for the industry," says Vahid Fathi, metals analyst with Prescott, Ball & Turben Inc., who had estimated Reynolds would earn about $2.35 a share. 

The nation's No. 2 aluminum company said earnings were hurt by lower prices for certain fabricated aluminum products, which typically follow price fluctuations of primary ingots.
The base metal price has dropped 30.3% from a year earlier to 78 cents a pound.
Much of the price decline has been blamed on a slowing economy and the third quarter is typically the industry's slowest period. 

But William O. Bourke, chairman and chief executive officer, said the ingot price "appears to have bottomed out." He said shipments are continuing at a "healthy" pace and the company has no excess inventory.
Aluminum shipments of 329,600 metric tons were nearly equal to the year-earlier period, the company said. 

Nevertheless, the company said that in the latest quarter there were increased material and labor costs, including a new employee profit-sharing plan. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Reynolds closed at $55.375, up $1.25.
