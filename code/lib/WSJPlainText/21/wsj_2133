Flowers Industries Inc. said it will report a charge of eight cents to 10 cents a share for its fiscal first quarter, ended Sept. 23, from the sale of two bakeries, in High Point, N.C., and Gadsden, Ala. 

The convenience-food company said it sold the bakeries to Mills Family Bakery for an undisclosed amount.
It said the sales were part of a 1983 Federal Trade Commission Consent Order. 

A year earlier, Flowers had fiscal first-quarter net income of $8 million, or 23 cents a share, on revenue of $170.4 million.
