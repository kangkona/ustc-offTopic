Once again, your editorial page misstates the law to conform to your almost beatific misperceptions.
In an excursus of little relevance to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups, Michael S. Greve informs your readers, ". . . the Clean Water Act is written upon the presumption -- the pretense, rather -- that nothing but zero risk will do; it establishes a legal standard of zero discharge" ("Congress's Environmental Buccaneers," Sept. 18). 

This statement surely buttresses your editorial viewpoint that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive, but it is simply wrong.
The Clean Water Act contains no "legal standard" of zero discharge.
It requires that "discharges of pollutants" into the "waters of the United States" be authorized by permits that reflect the effluent limitations developed under section 301.
Whatever may be the problems with this system, it scarcely reflects "zero risk" or "zero discharge." 

Perhaps Mr. Greve was confused by Congress's meaningless statement of "the national goal" in section 101, which indeed calls for the elimination of discharges -- by 1985, no less.
This fatuous statement was not taken seriously when enacted in 1972, and should not now be confused with the operative provisions of the statute. 

Thus, you do the public a great disservice when Mr. Greve suggests, even facetiously, that the Clean Water Act prohibits the preparation of a scotch and water; your tippling readers may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them, as they cower in the night with their scotch and waters, from the hairyknuckled knock of the Sierra Club at their doors.
