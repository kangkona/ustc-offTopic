Macmillan Inc. said it plans a public offering of 8.4 million shares of its Berlitz International Inc. unit at $19 to $21 a share. 

The offering for the language school unit was announced by Robert Maxwell, chairman and chief executive officer of London-based Maxwell Communication Corp., which owns Macmillan. 

After the offering is completed, Macmillan will own about 56% of the Berlitz common stock outstanding.
Five million shares will be offered in the U.S., and 3.4 million additional shares will be offered in concurrent international offerings outside the U.S. Goldman, Sachs & Co. will manage the offering. 

Macmillan said Berlitz intends to pay quarterly dividends on the stock.
The company said it expects to pay the first dividend, of 12.5 cents a share, in the 1990 first quarter. 

Berlitz will borrow an amount equal to its expected net proceeds from the offerings, plus $50 million, in connection with a credit agreement with lenders.
The total borrowing will be about $208 million, the company said.
Proceeds from the borrowings under the credit agreement will be used to pay an $80 million cash dividend to Macmillan and to lend the remainder of about $128 million to Maxwell Communications in connection with a promissory note. 

Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay borrowings under the short-term parts of a credit agreement. 

Berlitz, which is based in Princeton, N.J., provides language instruction and translation services through more than 260 language centers in 25 countries.
In the past five years, more than 68% of its sales have been outside the U.S. Macmillan has owned Berlitz since 1966. 

In the first six months of this year, Berlitz posted net income of $7.6 million on sales of $106.2 million, compared with net income of $8.2 million on sales of $90.6 million.
