Damon Darlin is a fine reporter of serious topics.
Don't waste his talents with fatuous assignments such as the Sept. 20 page-one article about gift-giving in Korea.
You sunk just about as low as NBC did in its reporting on Korean life during last year's Olympics. 

You media folks don't get it, do you?
About the Big Picture in Korea, I mean.
Your "Tee Hee" treatment of the dramatically improved life style that the Koreans have forged, particularly in the past 10 years, is insulting to the strong bonds between our two nations. 

Non-"Saturday Night Live" journalists might have analyzed that embedded in the commercial hype of the "Tae Porum" gift-giving season is an immense compliment to American assistance to Korea.
Some of us, who were personal or official participants in the days when the U.S. was able to supply needed material and morale boosts to a destitute nation, now rejoice that the better life we thought possible for Korea has come to fruition. 

A Korean farmer toiled with a wooden plow in his field behind a bullock in 1964.
He now has a son who sells his nation's autos, computers and a hundred other products to a declining American manufacturing-sector work force.
If we and the Koreans gaze at the same full harvest moon during "Tae Porum" today, which side has uneasy visions of future bitter harvests?
