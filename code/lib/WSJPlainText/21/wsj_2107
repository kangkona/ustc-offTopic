Honeywell Inc. said it hopes to complete shortly the first of two sales of shares in its Japanese joint venture, Yamatake-Honeywell, for about $280 million. 

The company wouldn't disclose the buyer of the initial 16% stake. 

Proceeds of the sale, expected to be completed next week, would be used to repurchase as many as 10 million shares of Honeywell stock, the company said. 

Honeywell said it is negotiating the sale of a second stake in Yamatake-Honeywell, but indicated it intends to hold at least 20% of the joint venture's stock long term.
A 20% stake would allow Honeywell to include Yamatake earnings in its results. 

Honeywell previously said it intended to reduce its holding in the Japanese concern as part of a restructuring plan which also calls for a reduction of dependence on weapons sales.
Yesterday a spokeswoman said the company was "pleased with our progress" in that regard and "hopes to provide additional details soon." 

Honeywell said its Defense and Marine Systems group incurred delays in shipping some undisclosed contracts during the third quarter, resulting in lower operating profit for that business. 

Overall, Honeywell reported earnings of $74.4 million, or $1.73 a share, for the three months ended Oct. 1 compared with a loss of $41.4 million, or 98 cents a share, a year earlier.
The previous period's results included a $108 million pretax charge related to unrecoverable contract costs and a $12.3 million pretax gain on real estate sales.
Sales for the latest quarter were flat, at $1.72 billion. 

For the nine months, Honeywell reported earnings of $212.1 million, or $4.92 a share, compared with earnings of $47.9 million, or $1.13 a share, a year earlier.
Sales declined slightly to $5.17 billion.
