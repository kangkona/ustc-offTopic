Pall Corp. said it expects a reduction in net income for the first quarter ended Oct. 28 of about $2 million, or five cents a share, as a result of Hurricane Hugo. 

The maker of disposable filters said revenue will be reduced about $3 million because of damage done by the hurricane to the company's three plants in Puerto Rico.
In the year-earlier quarter, Pall had net of $8.3 million, or 22 cents a share, on revenue of $100.5 million.
