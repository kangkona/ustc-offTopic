CONTINENTAL MORTGAGE & EQUITY TRUST said it will resume dividend payments with a 10-cent-a-share payout on Nov. 6 to shares of record Oct. 25.
The Dallas real estate investment trust last paid a dividend on Dec. 31, 1987, when shareholders received $1 a share.
Despite continuing troubles with problem assets and nonperforming loans, the trust said it expects to be able to maintain or increase the rate of distributions because of operations of joint-venture properties.
