Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and an affiliate, Matsushita Graphic Communications Systems Inc., said that they will establish a plant in Britain to make facsimile machines. 

The new production facility, to be located in Reading, will be capable of producing 100,000 facsimile machines a year initially, but the production capacity will double in 1992, according to company officials. 

Production is scheduled to start in April next year with an initial work force of about 100 people.
The number will increase to 200 in about four years, however, officials said.
The facsimile machines will be marketed under the "Panasonic" brand name. 

Officials said Matsushita Graphic Communications Systems (U.K.) Ltd., established last March with capital of #6 million ($9.4 million), will occupy part of the production site. 

Matsushita is Japan's largest maker of electric and electronic products for consumers and industry.
