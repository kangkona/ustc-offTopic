Shareholder suits were filed against First Pennsylvania Corp. and CoreStates Financial Corp. over CoreStates' proposed acquisition of First Pennsylvania for stock valued at $18.75 a share, or about $730 million. 

The suits, which seek to block the acquisition, allege that in accepting CoreStates' offer Monday, directors of First Pennsylvania "left on the table" a higher offer from Meridian Bancorp. 

CoreStates emerged last Friday as a bidder for First Pennsylvania, after Meridian, of Reading, Pa., put First Pennsylvania in play.
Meridian first offered stock valued at $18 a share for the Philadelphia bank.
During a weekend of negotiations, Meridian raised its bid, offering stock valued at about $20.85 a share. 

The suits claim First Pennsylvania and its directors "rushed to sign the agreement with CoreStates." CoreStates sweetened its bid to $18.75 share, which First Pennsylvania accepted, during the weekend talks. 

The suits also seek to block a "lockup option" First Pennsylvania granted to CoreStates, which would allow CoreStates to purchase 20% of First Pennsylvania's stock at $15.25 a share under certain conditions. 

As many as 19 shareholder suits were consolidated into one complaint which was filed late Tuesday in the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia.
Three of the suits were assembled late last month after Meridian announced its bid for First Pennsylvania.
A lawyer representing some of the shareholders said there was concern First Pennsylvania might not openly consider Meridian offer and not respond to it. 

First Pennsylvania officials still hadn't seen a copy of the suit late yesterday.
But Leslie Butler, the bank's vice chairman, said the company's policy is to not comment on matters under litigation.
Officials at CoreStates said, "We believe the suit has no merit, and will be vigorously defended." 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, First Pennsylvania closed at $16.625 a share, up 12.5 cents.
In national over-the-counter trading, CoreStates was unchanged at $46.75 a share.
