Stocks fell slightly as investors took profits in sectors that have been in fashion lately. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.42 to 2683.89, and Standard & Poor's 500stock index slipped 0.08 to 346.47.
Turnover came to 136,640,000 shares on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with Tuesday's 141,610,000. 

There were further signs in the market that money managers are turning defensive.
Traders said they saw a rotation out of sectors that were fashionable only a month ago and a selective flight to blue-chips. 

"Of concern to me is the earnings picture," said William T. Oliver Jr., vice president at Chemical Bank Trust & Investment. "I think earnings in two of the next three quarters will be down.
We are sitting on about 15% cash." Mr. Oliver said medium-term bonds -- with terms of about seven years to maturity -- look better than most stocks right now. 

Among the recently hot issues that fell out of favor were auto stocks.
Ford Motor closed down 3/4 at 50 7/8, Chrysler fell 3/4 to 25, and General Motors slipped 7/8 to 48.
On Aug. 15, Oppenheimer analyst Charles Brady told Dow Jones News Service the group represents "excellent value." General Motors closed at 45 1/2 that day.
Yesterday, Mr. Brady said: "I am still very positive on the group.
What you are seeing is general uncertainty about the {entire} market." 

Drug stocks, another recent investing fad, were sold as well.
Abbott Laboratories tumbled 1 1/8 to 63, and Pfizer eased 1/2 to 67 3/4.

Both issues were pursued by investors, traders said. 

Chase Manhattan rose 1 5/8 to 39 1/2.
Trading was halted just before the market's close for a news announcement.
After the close, Chase stunned traders and analysts by announcing a charge against third-quarter earnings of $1.31 billion, or $1.26 billion after taxes.
It cited a fattened reserve for loan losses, some loan write-downs and losses in securities trading. 

Dividend-related trading boosted two stocks to the top of the active list, traders said.
Southeast Bank closed unchanged at 26 1/2 on volume of 1.6 million shares, and Portland General gained 1/8 to 23 7/8 on volume of about 1.3 million shares.
Both stocks went ex-dividend Tuesday.

The Wall Street Journal reported that the Food and Drug Administration is investigating the safety of Upjohn's prescription drug Halcion, the most widely prescribed sleeping agent in the world. 

Also on the active list, Public Service Enterprise Group added 1/8 to 26 1/2.
An offering of five million common shares was priced late Tuesday at $26.375 each. 

Spain Fund soared 7, or 32%, to 28 3/4.
Trading in the fund was delayed early in the session because of an order imbalance. 

Shares of another closed-end fund that invests in some Spanish securities, First Iberian Fund, were also up sharply, gaining 1 3/8 to 12 3/8. 

Germany Fund gained 1/2 to 11, and a fourth European fund, Italy Fund, rose 3/4, or 9.9%, to 10 7/8. 

L.A. Gear, which fell 4 Tuesday, recovered 2 3/4 to close at 75 3/4.

Storage Technology gained 1 3/8 to 12 5/8 after being awarded a $1.7 million contract by the Air Force for robotic computer storage equipment. 

Ferro gained 5/8 to 33 7/8.
Merrill Lynch raised its rating on the specialty chemicals company to "neutral" from "below average," according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.
The brokerage company also boosted its 1990 earnings estimate for Ferro to $2.35 a share from $2.13.
Merrill's $2.25-a-share 1989 estimate remains unchanged. 

Grow Group dropped 1/4 to 11 7/8.
