Neal Garonzik, a managing director in Morgan Stanley & Co. 's mergers and acquisitions group, resigned from the investment bank to join Thomas A. Saunders III, a former top Morgan official, in an undisclosed new venture. 

Mr. Garonzik, who is 40 years old, was in charge of the mergers and acquisitions financial institutions group at Morgan.
The 53-year-old Mr. Saunders resigned last month as a managing director of Morgan and chairman of Morgan's leveraged buy-out fund.
Officials at several of Morgan's competitors said Mr. Saunders's departure may have been accelerated because of conflict among the investment banking, merchant banking and corporate finance divisions at the firm.
But Mr. Saunders said his departure had "nothing whatsoever" to do with rivalries within the firm. 

"I don't think anything is wrong with Morgan Stanley," Mr. Garonzik said, referring to his decision to join Mr. Saunders in a new business. "I've known Tommy for a long time, and we have a lot of respect for each other.
We haven't decided what we're going to be doing yet." 

In a terse internal memorandum, Eric Gleacher, head of Morgan's investment banking department, said Mr. Garonzik "will be leaving the firm to pursue his own business interests.
Neal has been with the firm nine years and has made a significant contribution over that period in the equity, merchant banking and M&A areas.
We regret his departure and wish him the best for the future." 

Morgan said it named Philip N. Duff as Mr. Garonzik's successor.
