The Dutch government presented Parliament with a budget proposal for 1990 that holds state spending little changed from a year earlier at 176.8 billion guilders (US$80.4 billion), including five billion guilders of income tax cuts. 

The budget must be approved by Parliament before it takes effect Jan. 1. 

The package may very well be the last major policy initiative from the seven-year-old ruling coalition of centrist Christian Democrats and conservative Liberals that now holds caretaker status after the Sept. 6 general election.
In that election, the Liberals suffered substantial parliamentary losses. 

In the 1990 budget, outlays for public housing and education in general would be trimmed modestly in favor of other programs.
Spending on environmental programs would be increased modestly. 

The Netherlands has more or less frozen defense spending, halving the current year's 2% annual rise to a rate of less than 1% for next year to 14.3 billion guilders.
