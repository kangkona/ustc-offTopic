A group led by Edward S. Buchanan said it will seek to elect three directors at Grow Group Inc. 's annual meeting Oct. 25. 

Grow Group, a New York maker of coatings, paint and household products, said it will "vigorously oppose" any such attempt by the group, which holds 9.4%. 

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group said that if its nominees are elected, it plans to pursue "the immediate sale of the company as the means most likely to enhance and to protect shareholder value." Grow Group's board has nine members. 

"Prompt action" is necessary, the group said, because of "continued poor performance by incumbent management" following the termination of a PPG Industries Inc. offer.
Last September, a proposal under which PPG Industries would have acquired Grow Group fell through. 

Grow said the dissidents threatened a proxy fight at last year's meeting. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Grow Group shares closed at $11.875, down 25 cents.
