Mexican investor Joel Rocha Garza said the U.S. District Court for Southern California denied his request for a temporary restraining order to prevent Smith Laboratories Inc. from implementing its shareholder rights plan. 

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Rocha Garza, who holds 8.8% of Smith Laboratories' common stock, said the court scheduled an Oct. 23 hearing on his motion for a preliminary injunction. 

Mr. Rocha Garza sued Smith Laboratories on Sept. 12, seeking injunctive relief against the implementation of the company's poison-pill takeover defense. 

Smith Laboratories President Timothy J. Wollaeger said the company was pleased with the court's ruling "but recognize that Mr. Garza will have additional avenues to pursue in the future." 

San Diego-based Smith Laboratories designs, makes and sells medical products.
