Scott's Hospitality Inc. said it will pay a special dividend of three Canadian dollars (US$2.54) a share, or a total of about C$180 million, following a "one-time windfall" gain from the recent sale of a hotel chain. 

Scott's, which has interests in fast food, photography, transportation and hotels, will still "have room to make major acquisitions" following the special cash payout, said Bruce Dodds, senior vice president and chief financial officer. 

The Toronto company continues to seek acquisitions within its core business areas, mostly in the range of C$100 million to C$200 million, Mr. Dodds said. 

The special dividend reflects the board's "confidence" in the earnings outlook for the Toronto-based company, Andrew McCaughey, Scott's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.
The special dividend will be paid Nov. 1 to both the Class C and subordinated voting shares of record Oct. 16. 

Scott's sold its Commonwealth Hospitality Ltd. hotel subsidiary to Bass PLC for C$285 million in May.
Net proceeds from the sale amounted to C$230 million.
