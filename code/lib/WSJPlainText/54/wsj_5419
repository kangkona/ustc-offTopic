Stan West Mining Corp. President George F. Warnock resigned as the company abandoned a plan to recapitalize. 

Stan West said it decided against going ahead with the plan for a private placement of convertible debentures because of the continued weakness in gold prices.
As a result, the company's principal secured creditor, Elders Finance Group of Australia, will assume ownership of the company's only mine, McCabe Mine in Arizona, by means of a trustee's sale. 

William C. Jones, general counsel for the company, said that in transfering ownership of the mine, the company hopes to avoid filing for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. 

Mr. Jones said Mr. Warnock's resignation was related to the transfer of ownership of the McCabe Mine to Elders in that "He was retained to evaluate the mine and operate it if we got it back into production," and now there isn't a mine for the company to operate. 

Mr. Warnock, 57 years old, was named president in April when Stan West acquired 15% of Coronado Resources Inc., a Canadian exploration company of which Mr. Warnock was president.
Mr. Warnock was traveling yesterday and couldn't be reached for comment.
