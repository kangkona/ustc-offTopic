Nestle S.A. posted first-half consolidated net income of 1.023 billion Swiss francs ($604.9 million) and said that earnings for all of 1989 may exceed the 1988 level by as much as 15%. 

The big Swiss food concern didn't provide comparable figures for the first half of 1988, because yesterday's report marked the first time Nestle has provided detailed earnings for the six-month period. 

The forecast of a 15% increase in earnings in 1989 was at the low end of analysts' expectations.
Nestle had 1988 consolidated net profit of 2.04 billion Swiss francs.
The company added that because of seasonal factors, its first-half profit is likely to be less than half the full-year figure. 

Nestle said sales of chocolates in such areas as North America "earn the greater part of their annual profit during the second half of the year." It also said first-half earnings were affected by "heavy expenditure on the launching of new products." 

As reported earlier, Nestle's first-half sales surged 36% to 23.6 billion francs from 17.4 billion francs a year earlier.
Excluding contributions from acquisitions, however, first-half sales were up 19%.
