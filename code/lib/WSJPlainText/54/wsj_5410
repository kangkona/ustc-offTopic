Aldus Corp., Seattle, said it began shipping a modified version of its Aldus PageMaker 3.0 desktop publishing program for Microsoft Corp. 's OS/2 operating system software. 

Aldus, a high-technology company whose earnings stalled in the second quarter because of excess inventory, said the program is the first to incorporate the OS/2 software's advanced technology.
Microsoft is trying to make OS/2 the industry standard for operating systems software, which controls a computer's basic functions.
The product has yet to catch on well with users, however. 

Aldus had flat earnings of $3.4 million, or 26 cents a share, in the second quarter after a string of quarterly profit jumps.
In the first quarter, for example, Aldus's net income was up 39% at $4.3 million, or 33 cents a share.
