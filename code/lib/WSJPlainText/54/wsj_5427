In a bid to attract new investors, Corporate Data Sciences Inc. said its board approved a restructuring plan to split the company into two separately traded concerns. 

Corporate Data, which produces and markets paperboard, corrugated shipping containers and packaging materials, and makes kitchen cabinets, said it will divide the company into an integrated paper concern and into a diversified industrial holding company which will include its kitchen cabinet operations.
The company said it is as yet unclear how much stock in the two new companies current Corporate Data shareholders will receive. 

But Alfred Schoenberg, Corporate Data's chairman, said the new paper company has received an oral agreement from an undisclosed New York private investment group to invest at least $5 million. 

Corporate Data said it will sell to Marcom Telecommunications Inc. its non-paper operations, namely its kitchen cabinet operations, in exchange for an undisclosed amount of Marcom stock.
As a result, Corporate Data, which already owns about 40% of Marcom's stock, will own "a substantial majority" of Marcom's 10 million common shares outstanding.
After the acquisition, Marcom will be called Aril Group Inc. and its president will be Mr. Schoenberg.
Marcom is based in West Palm Beach, Fla. 

Corporate Data will then spin off its shares of Aril pro rata to Corporate Data's shareholders. 

Corporate Data will remain a paper company operating under the name of Consolidated Packaging Holdings; its shares will be distributed to current Corporate Data holders as well.
The company said the restructuring is subject, among other things, to shareholder approval. 

In national over-the-counter trading, Corporate Data closed at $6.375, unchanged.
