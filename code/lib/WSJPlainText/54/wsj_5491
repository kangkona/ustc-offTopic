T. Boone Pickens, repeatedly rebuffed in his efforts to get representation on the board of Koito Manufacturing Co., is now calling on the Japanese company to increase its interim dividend as of Sept. 30 to seven yen (4.8 U.S. cents) a share from four yen a share. 

Mr. Pickens is chairman of the investment firm of Boone Co., which holds 20.2% of the auto-parts maker and is its biggest shareholder.
His request has been mailed to Koito's major holders, asking for their support and explaining that the company recently realized an unexpected profit of 1.2 billion yen ($8.2 million). 

The unexpected earnings, Mr. Pickens said, are "almost equivalent to the amount of the retained earnings brought forward into the current fiscal year," so increasing the dividend "would not harm the financial stability of Koito."
