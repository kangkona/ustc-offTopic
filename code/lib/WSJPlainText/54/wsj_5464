UPJOHN Co. raised its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share.
The new dividend, a 14% increase from the previous 22-cent distribution, is payable Nov. 1 to shares of record Oct. 4.
The dividend was increased "as an expression of confidence in our long-term future performance," said Theodore Cooper, chairman of the Kalamazoo, Mich., pharmaceutical concern.
The dividend was last raised in October 1988, by four cents a share.
