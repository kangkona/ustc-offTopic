Allergan Inc. said that two shareholder lawsuits were filed in a federal court in Philadelphia alleging misstatements of material facts in connection with the recent spinoff of the eye and skin-care company. 

Allergan, Irvine, Calif., was spun off in July from SmithKline Beckman Corp. as part of the recent merger of SmithKline and Beecham Group PLC.
The two combined pharmaceuticals companies were renamed SmithKline Beecham.
SmithKline Beecham and Gavin Herbert, Allergan's chairman and chief executive officer, were named defendants in the suits, which allege that false statements were made or material facts were omitted about Allergan's business and prospects. 

The suits seek class-action status and unspecified damages. 

Allergan denied the allegations and said it will "vigorously contest the actions." In Philadelphia, a spokesman for SmithKline Beecham said the company didn't have anything to add to Allergan's comment.
