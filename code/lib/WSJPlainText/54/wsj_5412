The Federal Reserve's unexpected efforts to drive down the value of the U.S. dollar battered the bond market yesterday, forcing prices lower in quiet trading. 

The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell nearly 7/8 point, or about $8.75 for each $1,000 face amount.
The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 8.16%. 

In the corporate bond market, more than $2 billion in new debt was issued, including an unusual offering by Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which sold $902.6 million face amount of zero-coupon convertible subordinated notes.
Meanwhile, certain so-called high quality junk bonds continued to recover from last week's sell-off with some issues rising as much as one point.
Prices in the broader corporate bond market were flat to about 3/4 point lower. 

Treasurys opened slightly lower, but the selling picked up momentum after news spread that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was selling dollars.
The Fed intervention in the foreign exchange market was a surprise because the selling occurred at a point when the U.S. currency wasn't especially strong. 

Bond traders said several other factors contributed to the market's weak tone, including the prospect of a new supply and disappointment that the Federal Reserve's so-called Tan Book didn't show sufficient slowing in the economy to warrant another easing of interest rates by the Fed. 

"Dealers are taking a lead from GM {General Motors Corp.} and cutting prices to move inventory," said Paul Kasriel, a vice president and monetary economist at Northern Trust Co. "There's a lot of new supply coming out," he said. 

Next week, the Treasury will auction $32 billion of securities, including $14.8 billion of bills, $9.75 billion in two-year notes and $7.75 billion in four-year notes.
The size of all three auctions was increased significantly over that of the last previous, similar auctions.
That continues a pattern that the Treasury started several months ago when it began to increase the size of its regularly scheduled security sales to help pay for the thrift-industry bailout.
In when-issued trading, the two-year notes traded at a price to yield 8.22% while the new four-year notes traded at a price to yield 8.18%. 

The Fed report said that the economy continues to grow modestly, but that economic conditions still vary substantially from region to region.
The condition of the nation's manufacturing sector was described as "generally satisfactory or improving" in the Southern and Western regions, but weakening in New England and much of the Midwest. 

Corporate Issues 

The Berkshire Hathaway offering was the highlight of yesterday's busy new-issue market. 

The Omaha, Neb.-based company controlled by billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett, offered $902.6 million of zero-coupon convertible subordinated notes.
The offering was described as a huge success, with orders far exceeding supply.
Syndicate officials said the size of the issue was increased from an orginally planned $585 million face amount. 

Institutional investors were eager to buy the notes because the purchase enables them to indirectly acquire Berkshire Hathaway common, an expensive but consistently solid performer on the New York Stock Exchange.
Essentially, the bond offering marks the first time that Berkshire Hathaway has sold stock, albeit indirectly, since Mr. Buffett gained control more than 24 years ago. 

The 15-year zero-coupon notes, underwritten by Salomon Brothers Inc. and rated double-A-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc., were offered at a price of 44.314 to yield 5.5%.
Each $10,000 face amount note can be converted at any time into Berkshire Hathaway common at a price of $9,815, a 15% premium over yesterday's closing stock price of $8,535.
Since the notes were sold at such a deep discount {at a price of about $4,400 each} and the stock price is high, it would take more than two $10,000 face amount notes to acquire one share of Berkshire Hathaway common. 

Strong demand for corporate securities caused two other issuers to boost the size of their planned offerings.
NCNB Corp., the Charlotte, N.C., banking concern, increased the size of its 20-year subordinated note issue to $400 million from an orginally slated $300 million.
The noncallable notes, underwritten by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, were priced to yield 9.479%. 

Eastman Kodak Co., the Rochester, N.Y.-based photographic equipment and pharmaceutical concern, increased the size of its offering of 15-year notes to $300 million from $250 million.
The noncallable issue was priced to yield 9.785%. 

Treasury Securities 

Treasury securities ended lower in light trading.
The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 99 15/32 compared with 100 9/32 Tuesday.
The latest 10-year notes were quoted at a price of 98 25/32 to yield 8.16% compared with 99 10/32 to yield 8.08% Tuesday.
The latest two-year notes were quoted at a price of 99 29/32 to yield 8.26%, compared with 100 5/32 to yield 8.12%. 

Short-term interest rates also rose.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was 7.82% for a bond equivalent yield of 8.07%, while the rate on six-month bills was 7.74% for a bond equivalent yield of 8.15%. 

Foreign Bonds 

Chase Investment Bank Ltd. became the 10th firm to halt market making in Britain's #120 billion ($188.4 billion) government bond market since deregulation three years ago. 

The bank, a unit of New York-based Chase Manhattan Corp., said the move was based on an unsatisfactorily low return on capital.
Chase said it will still trade government bonds, called gilts, for its own account and will maintain an agency-dealing role on behalf of clients. 

Since August, Merrill Lynch International & Co. and Credit Lyonnais Securities halted market making, while ANZ Merchant Bank Ltd. stopped trading on behalf of clients. 

Now, with 19 market makers remaining, some analysts say there still are too many firms chasing too little business.
The gilts' market is shrinking because the government has been using its large budget surplus to buy back outstanding issues and hasn't issued new bonds.
That has made bondholders reluctant to sell their gilts and has put a firm artificial floor under prices. 

So far this year, Britain's Treasury has purchased about #5 billion of gilts.
The Bank of England on Sept. 29 will buy up to #400 million further through a "reverse auction," in which it invites bond holders to offer certain maturities to it on a competitive basis. 

Meanwhile, British government bonds ended slightly lower.
The benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007 fell 6/32 to 113 11/32 to yield 9.91% while the Treasury 12% issue due 1995 was unchanged at 104 3/4 to yield 10.78%. 

Elsewhere: 

-- In Japan, rumors and bearish interpretation of comments made by a top central banker pushed prices lower. 

The Japanese bond market opened firmer amid talk that Nomura Securities Co. and other big dealers would try to build up the market for "window dressing." 

Then the market gradually weakened as bearish sentiment revived.
The selling picked up speed later when Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita refused to discuss interest rates at a regularly scheduled news conference.
When asked if Japan will coordinate with West Germany on the interest-rate front, Mr. Sumita said he didn't wish to comment.
That was interpreted bearishly by investors. 

Japan's bellwether No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers' screens at 95.67, off 0.08 on the day.
The yield rose 1.5 percentage points to 5.325%. 

-- West German government bond prices ended about 1/8 to 1/4 point stronger as investors sold U.S. Treasurys and bought deutsche bonds. 

Bonn's 6 3/4% issue due June 1999 ended at 99.25, up 0.35 point to yield 6.85% while the 6 3/4% notes due 1994 rose 0.13 point to 98.90 to yield 7.05%. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities 

Mortgage securities ended 13/32 to 15/32 lower but held up better than intermediate Treasury securities after light dealings. 

In the derivative market, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. issued the first real estate mortgage investment conduit of the week in a $350 million transaction underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 

The deal featured 21 classes -- apparently the most for any derivative mortgage securities issue in the six-year history of the market. 

The offering, backed by Freddie Mac 9 1/2 securities, included just about every type of Remic class ever conceived, including planned amortization classes, "companion" bonds, floating-rate securities, inverse floating-rate bonds, accrual bonds and interest-only securities. 

Meanwhile, Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for October delivery finished at 97 10/32, off 15/32; and Freddie Mac 9% securities were at 96 1/2, down 13/32. 

The Ginnie Mae 9% securities yielded 9.51% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note narrowed .02 percentage point to 1.35.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 19/32 to 98 7/8. 

Municipals 

The specter of mounting supply cast a pall over yesterday's municipal market session, with actively quoted issues posting 1/4 to 3/4 point losses in late dealings. 

The tax-exempt arena is facing a 30-day forward supply approaching $6 billion at a time when dealer shelves are stocked from the wealth of new issues priced in recent weeks. 

Compounding the situation, investors have been hesitant to become buyers in the secondary market as new issues come to market at prices that are cheap relative to outstanding debt.
In recent sessions, retail selling has been steady. 

Underwriters led by Lazard Freres & Co. expect the formal award for the approximately $874 million of Dormitory Authority of the State of New York bonds launched Tuesday.
Allotments may be made today, according to the lead manager. 

New Jersey Turnpike Authority 7.20% issue of 2018 was locked at 96 5/8, a 1/2 point lower for the day, with a yield of about 7.49%, roughly .05 percentage point higher than late Tuesday. 

While the municipal market doesn't have an actual benchmark security, the Turnpike issue often reflects broad market trends, largely because of its liquidity. 

To date, with the Turnpike-widening project experiencing construction delays, only about $400 million of the proceeds from the total $2 billion record-breaking bond issue have been expended.
Turnpike Authority officials say only another $150 million to $200 million will likely be spent by the November 1990 call date. 

Nonetheless, Turnpike Authority officials have repeatedly stated that the issuer hasn't any intention of exercising that par call.
