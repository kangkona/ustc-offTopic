Ramada Inc. said the conclusion of its restructuring will probably be delayed as many as two weeks because of the recent tumult in the junk bond market. 

The delay stems from the financing to be arranged for Aztar Corp., the new company that will operate Ramada's gambling operations.
Salomon Brothers Inc. is expected to underwrite an offering of high-yield notes: $170 million in first mortgage notes, $130 million in senior subordinated reset notes and $100 million in senior subordinated notes as part of the financing. 

Paul Rubeli, head of Ramada's gambling operations, called the delay an unforseen but minor hitch similar to the slight delay in getting the transaction approved by state casino regulators.
When the transaction is completed, Aztar stock will begin trading over the counter under the symbol AZTR. 

Ramada has agreed to sell its lodging business to New World Development Co. of Hong Kong and Prime Motor Inns Inc. of Fairfield, N.J., for $540 million.
The final step of the restructuring will be the merger of Ramada and a subsidiary of New World, and the distribution to Ramada shareholders of cash and stock in Aztar. 

The company had previously planned to finish the restructuring by today.
Ramada's stock closed at $14, up 12.5 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
