Tarmac PLC, a British home-builder and construction materials supplier, reported a 23% rise in pretax profit for the first half but sounded a note of caution on the six months to come. 

The pretax profit of #153.8 million ($241.8 million) is ahead of average market forecasts of #150 million and year-earlier earnings of #125.2 million. 

Profit after taxes and minority interests advanced 22% to #95.1 million, or 13.2 pence a share, from #78.2 million, or 11 pence, in the first six months of 1988.
There were no extraordinary items in either period. 

Faced with sharply higher interest rates and flagging demand for new homes in Britain, Tarmac "made the most of its opportunities in the first half," said Eric Pountain, Tarmac's chairman.
But while Mr. Pountain pointed to an upturn in some areas of the domestic market, he added that conditions overall remain glum after a three-year construction boom.
