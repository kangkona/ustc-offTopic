A federal judge ordered the United Mine Workers to end its occupation of a Pittston Co. coal preparation plant or pay additional multimillion-dollar fines. 

District Judge Glen M. Williams in Abingdon, Va., ordered the 100 UMW members and hundreds of union supporters gathered outside the plant to leave by last night.
UMW officials vowed to remain.
The union already faces millions of dollars of fines related to the five-month strike at Pittston. 

The group moved into the Moss No. 3 preparation plant, located near Dante, Va., on Sunday as part of the UMW's strike against the Greenwich, Conn., company. 

The judge ruled that if the group doesn't leave, the UMW must pay damages to Pittston for all losses resulting from the occupation of the plant.
Since Sunday, all coal processing at the plant has stopped. 

The UMW will be fined $600,000 for each day it ignores the judge's order.
The ruling also calls for additional fines against leaders of the group. 

Michael Odom, president of Pittston's coal group, said the plant handled 20% of Pittston's coal processing prior to the strike.
