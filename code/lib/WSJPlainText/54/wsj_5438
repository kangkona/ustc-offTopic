Sierra On-Line Inc. said it expects net income in the second quarter ending Sept. 30 to be flat compared with year-earlier operating profit of $789,000, mainly because of a new marketing agreement with International Business Machines Corp. 

Most analysts had been expecting Sierra to report net income in the $900,000-to-$1.2 million range.
In the year-earlier quarter, tax credits of $494,000 boosted net income $1.3 million, or 48 cents a share. 

Sierra, which makes computer games, said the marketing agreement calls for it to supply IBM with certain products that will be sold with some IBM personal computer models over the year-end holiday season. 

Ed Heinbockel, Sierra's chief financial officer, said that meeting the production demands of the agreement will result in reduced sales of some other products for the next few months.
Furthermore, he said Sierra will supply the products to IBM at costs below what it would ordinarily charge, pinching profit margins. 

Even so, Mr. Heinbockel called the IBM agreement a "marketing coup" that he predicted would spread the word about Sierra products and provide long-term benefits for the company. 

Mr. Heinbockel said Sierra remains "comfortable" with analysts' projections that second-quarter revenue will fall in the range of $6.5 million to $7 million, well above the $5.6 million posted in the year-earlier second quarter.
The company declined to give specific revenue or net income projections for the current quarter. 

In the first quarter ended June 30, Sierra earned $635,000, or 17 cents a share, on revenue of $4.1 million. 

In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Sierra rose $1.125 to $17.
