El Paso Electric Co. said it expects to report a loss in the third quarter resulting from a write-down on selling its stake in an Omaha, Neb., savings and loan association back to the thrift. 

In the year-earlier quarter, the Texas electric utility earned about $21.2 million, or 52 cents a share, on revenue of $187.8 million.
A spokesman declined to elaborate on the amount of the expected loss, but said third-quarter results will include an about $22 million loss from discontinued operations.
El Paso has recorded close to $100 million in write-downs thus far in 1989 as part of the divestiture of all of its non-utility assets and a regulatory disallowance. 

Under the pact, El Paso will sell back to Commercial Federal Savings & Loan Association about 600,000 shares of the S&L's preferred stock for $32 million plus interest and dividends.
The agreement also calls for El Paso to receive seven-year warrants to purchase as many as 1.4 million shares of Commercial Federal's parent company, Commercial Federal Corp., also of Omaha, for $15 a share.
