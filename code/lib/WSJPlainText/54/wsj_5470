South Korea's domestic auto sales jumped almost 50% in the first eight months of this year, while exports plunged more than 40%, the Trade and Industry Ministry reported. 

Officials said Hyundai Motor Co. and four other manufacturers sold a combined 475,407 motor vehicles, including cars and trucks, during the January-to-August period.
The increase in sales was attributed mainly to rising personal income among South Koreans. 

The five auto makers exported 207,547 motor vehicles, mostly cars, during the eight months.
Ministry officials blamed the 40% export decline on reduced shipments to the U.S. caused both by labor disputes affecting South Korean auto makers and sluggish U.S. demand for Korean cars.
