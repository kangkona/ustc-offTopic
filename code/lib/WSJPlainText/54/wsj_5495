Blackboard Jungle Revisited 

Teachers must learn 

And learn full well 

How to figure 

And how to spell; 

And these days, also 

(To judge by the news) 

Karate may be 

A subject to choose. 

-- Robert Gordon. 

Small Change? 

With our attitude toward government spending, 

It's no wonder deficits are climbing, 

For Congress can throw millions at problems 

And be chided for nickel and diming. 

-- Edward F. Dempsey. 

Peer Pressure 

If you study football players 

And their heroic stunts, 

You'll note that blocking backs 

Are really crushing fronts. 

-- Joshua Adams.
