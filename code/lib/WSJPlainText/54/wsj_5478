The Transportation Department put out a good-news, bad-news report showing that airline competition in recent years has increased at smaller airports but declined sharply at major hub airports. 

The findings, presented yesterday at a House Aviation Subcommittee hearing, are expected to help shape the continuing debate over whether the government should take action to foster airline competition.
The topic has become a hot issue recently, with further hearings scheduled for today in the Senate and tomorrow in the House. 

In describing the preliminary findings, Jeffrey Shane, assistant transportation secretary for policy and international affairs, said that increases in concentration at many large hub airports have been "substantial," adding that: 

-- In 1988, eight airlines accounted for 90% of domestic air traffic, compared with 15 carriers in 1984 and 11 in 1979, the year after passage of airline-deregulation legislation. 

-- In 1988, a single carrier controlled 75% or more of the aircraft departures at six large hubs.
No large hub was as concentrated in 1984 or 1979. 

-- In 1988, two carriers controlled 50% or more of the departures at 20 of the 27 large hubs.
That situation occurred at nine such hubs in 1984 and eight in 1979. 

But while concentration increased at larger airports, Mr. Shane said, "the reverse is true at many smaller airports." The department found that in 1988, 32 small hubs had four or more competing airlines, while only nine small hubs had that number of competitors in 1979.
In 1988, 23 smaller airports that aren't hubs had four or more competitors, compared with none in 1979. 

Mr. Shane said the department doesn't want the government to get back into the business of regulating airlines' routes and fares.
But he said Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner is searching for ways to make it easier for newer airlines to get landing rights at the nation's most crowded airports.
