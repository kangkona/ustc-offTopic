Computer Factory Inc. directors adopted an anti-takeover plan it said would protect shareholders from "coercive or unfair takeover tactics." 

The plan, similar to those adopted by many other companies, gives shareholders the right to purchase shares in an acquiring company at half-price, a step intended to make an unwelcome takeover prohibitively expensive. 

Computer Factory, Elmsford, N.Y., markets microcomputer products and business-automation systems through retail stores.
