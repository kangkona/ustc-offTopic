Hollinger Inc. said it bought more shares in United Newspapers PLC, boosting its stake to just over 8% from around 7%. 

Toronto-based Hollinger, which owns Britain's Daily Telegraph and other newspapers in the U.K., Canada and the U.S., made its latest purchases on Sept. 15 and now holds 15.3 million United Newspapers shares, according to figures reported by the U.K. company.
United Newspapers publishes London's Daily Express and Sunday Express newspapers. 

"We have been buying little bits {of United Newspapers shares} for a while," said Charles Cowan, vice president and secretary at Hollinger.
Mr. Cowan said he wasn't able to comment on Hollinger's reasons for the share purchases.
Other Hollinger officials couldn't be reached for comment. 

Hollinger and United Newspapers jointly own a London plant that prints both the Daily Telegraph and the Express.
