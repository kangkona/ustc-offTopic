Electronic Arts' long-awaited public offering went off at about $8 a share, a rich price for a computer game maker. 

The San Mateo, Calif., concern is one of the few game companies to consistently come up with profit makers.
It had said it would seek a price of $8 to $10, 18 to 22 times earnings.
That multiple is much higher than that of most computer game makers.
For example, Sierra On-Line Inc., Oakhurst, Calif., has been trading recently at a multiple of about 12 times earnings. 

In the offering, 2,076,165 Electronic Arts shares were sold, 1.4 million of them by the company.
The remaining shares were sold by certain shareholders.
The company now has about 9.3 million shares outstanding. 

Its games include Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer; Jordan vs.
Bird, a game between basketball's Michael Jordan and Larry Bird; and 688 Attack Sub. 

For the first quarter ended June 30, the company had net income of $825,000 on revenue of $13.7 million.
