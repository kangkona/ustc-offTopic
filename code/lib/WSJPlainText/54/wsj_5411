Genetics Institute said it received two U.S. patents, including one covering materials used to make the hormone M-CSF by recombinant DNA technology and another that claims a class of variants of the blood-clotting protein, Factor VIII. 

The M-CSF patent covers DNA sequences and engineered cells.
Another U.S. patent covering the manufacturing process itself is expected "shortly," the company said.
The Cambridge, Mass., biotechnology concern said it currently is testing M-CSF in clinical trials in cancer patients and in bone marrow transplant recipients. 

The Factor VIII patent also covers recombinant DNA methods for manufacture of the variants. "If proven safe and effective," the modified proteins "could offer a less expensive product for hemophilia treatment," Genetics Institute said.
