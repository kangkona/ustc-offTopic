The beleaguered West German retailer Co op AG will close about 10% of its stores by the end of this year, a company official said. 

The retailer, recently saved from the brink of bankruptcy by Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank, is trying to restructure to shed some debt and cut costs. 

The official, workers' council chairman Hubert Haselhoff, said the planned closure of 207 stores will affect about 2,500 employees for whom the company has prepared a comprehensive benefit plan. 

Mr. Haselhoff said the company, in addition to revamping its financial and employee structure, also has to move on its pricing policy. "Many customers say Co op is simply too expensive," he said.
