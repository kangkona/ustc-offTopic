Taiwan's trade with East Europe has shown a remarkable growth this year since the government last year relaxed rules to conduct business there, a government agency reported Tuesday. 

According to the Board of Foreign Trade, Taiwan's two-way trade with eight East European countries jumped to (U.S.$335.4 million) between January and July, up 41.7% from $236.7 million in a year-earlier period. 

Exports to East Europe rose 56% to $77.5 million and imports grew 38% to $257.9 million. 

Taiwan's exports to East Europe were mostly shoes, textiles and home appliances.
Major imports from that area were chemical materials and steels.
