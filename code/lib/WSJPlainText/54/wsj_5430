Teachers Insurance & Annuity Association, a major institutional investor, has agreed to buy 17 State Street, a new office tower on the tip of Manhattan. 

The 42-story building was completed in 1988 by William Kaufman Organization Ltd., a New York real-estate development concern, and is about 20% occupied.
Terms weren't disclosed. 

Robert Kaufman, executive vice president of Kaufman Organization, said that the nationwide teachers pension fund held a mortgage on the property exceeding $140 million and that the purchase price was "substantially above the mortgage." 

Using a market rate of about $300 a square foot for new commercial office properties in Manhattan, the 525,000-square-foot tower would sell for upwards of $157.5 million. 

Both parties emphasized that the sale was not, in effect, a foreclosure.
The building has had trouble attracting tenants willing to pay its relatively high rents.
The vacancies could have dragged down the purchase price, but the building is considered a high-quality structure. 

JMB Realty Corp., Chicago, was a partner in the project until February when Kaufman bought its stake for a price that wasn't disclosed.
