CMS Energy Corp., Jackson, Mich., said its Consumers Power Co. unit will spend about $100 million to replace the steam generators at its Palisades nuclear plant near South Haven, Mich., next year. 

CMS said the replacement will take about five months and is scheduled for the fall of 1990.
The timing of the replacement will coincide with the next scheduled refueling of the 780-megawatt plant. 

CMS said the replacement project won't have a significant impact on the company's proposal to sell the Palisades plant to an independent company formed by Consumers Power and Bechtel Group Inc., San Francisco. 

CMS said Bechtel will assist with the engineering and construction of the replacement project.
