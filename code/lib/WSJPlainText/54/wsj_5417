Comerica Inc., Detroit, said it signed a letter of intent to purchase Plaza Commerce Bancorp of San Jose, Calif., for $117 million. 

The merger won't take effect until Jan. 1, 1991, the earliest that such mergers are allowed under California law.
Comerica said the transaction will be accomplished through a tax-free exchange of common stock, with Comerica paying about $16.50 a share for Plaza Commerce common stock. 

To protect its interest in Plaza Commerce, Comerica has obtained warrants to acquire as much as 24.9% of the common shares of Plaza Commerce, Comerica said.
The Michigan bank holding company said it doesn't own any Plaza Commerce shares. 

The pact marks the first time an independent California bank has agreed to merge in anticipation of the January 1991 date.
