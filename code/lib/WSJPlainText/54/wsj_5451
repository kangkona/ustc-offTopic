Anacomp Inc. said it intends to spin off most of the computer-products businesses acquired last year in its $370 million purchase of Xidex Corp. 

After struggling for months to turn Xidex's magnetics businesses around, Anacomp's management said it would transfer its floppy disk and rigid oxide disk operations, as well as some data products operations, to a subsidiary to be called Dysan Corp. Anacomp would retain Xidex's micrographics businesses.
The spinoff, in the form of a dividend to Anacomp shareholders, is expected to occur by next spring. 

"Separating Anacomp and Dysan will enable the magnetics businesses, which have made tremendous strides in the last nine months, to focus on continuing their improvements in operating results," said Louis Ferrero, Anacomp's chairman and chief executive officer.
A company spokeswoman said the magnetics businesses are now profitable. 

Anacomp also announced a refinancing plan intended to reduce the cost of long-term debt largely associated with the Xidex acquisition.
It said its banks have agreed to increase credit lines to $375 million from $275 million.
The plan would make Dysan financially independent, Anacomp said.
The company also filed a registration statement for $225 million of senior subordinated notes. 

As part of the anticipated spinoff, Anacomp shareholders would receive all the common stock of Dysan while Anacomp would retain preferred stock.
Anacomp also would have board representation and would provide Dysan with administrative services, it said.
