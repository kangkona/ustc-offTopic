AmBase Corp., New York, said it expects third-quarter pretax profit will be reduced $23 million to $30 million as a result of losses at its insurance subsidiaries caused by Hurricane Hugo. 

The financial-services company had pretax profit of $39.2 million in the year-earlier period.
The company said this year's profit will be below the 1988 results because of the charge.
AmBase had net income last year of $27.2 million. 

The company, which changed its name from Home Group Inc. in May, said any additional losses from the hurricane that may arise will be covered by catastrophic reinsurance. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, AmBase closed at $15.625, up 50 cents.
