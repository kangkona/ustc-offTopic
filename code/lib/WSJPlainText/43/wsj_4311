Heritage Bancorp Inc. said it will add $17 million to its reserves for possible loan losses, which will result in a loss for its third quarter. 

In the year-earlier third quarter, Heritage earned $3 million, or 42 cents a share. 

The Holyoke, Mass., bank holding company also voted to pay a special 5% stock dividend in lieu of its quarterly cash dividend, payable Oct. 31, to stock of record on Oct. 10.
The company last paid a quarterly dividend of 7.5 cents a share on July 26. 

The addition to the loan-loss reserves brings the total reserves for possible loan losses at the end of the third quarter to $24.7 million. 

The company said the actions followed the completion of a comprehensive review of its loan portfolio, which disclosed a "significant increase" in non-accruing commercial real estate loans during the quarter.
