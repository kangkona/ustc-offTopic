UnionFed Financial Corp. and its Union Federal Savings Bank subsidiary said they will redeem on Oct. 13 all of their 7 1/4% convertible subordinated debentures due 2001. 

As of Wednesday, $15.7 million of the debentures had been converted into common stock of the parent, leaving $24.6 million of the debt issue outstanding.
Debenture holders may convert their debentures until 5 p.m. PDT, Oct. 10, into common stock at a conversion price of $16.67 a share, which is equal to 59.99 shares for each $1,000 principal amount of debentures.
