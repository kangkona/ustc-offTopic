Apple Bank for Savings, New York, said its change from a state-chartered savings bank to a bank holding company is effective today.
The firm's new name is Apple Bancorp Inc. 

Apple directors approved the change in February 1988.
The change was made, the company said, to permit Apple to pursue bank acquisitions more aggressively. 

This past March, Apple agreed to acquire Sag Harbor Savings Bank for about $29.5 million.
That deal is expected to be completed shortly, Apple said. 

Apple currently has assets of about $3.5 billion.
