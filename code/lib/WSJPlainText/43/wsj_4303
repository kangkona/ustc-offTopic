Unocal Corp. said it discovered natural gas at its Fairfax Prospect in California's Sacramento Valley. 

The company said its 100%-owned O'Banion Number 1 exploratory well tested natural gas at a rate of 6.7 million cubic feet per day through a 20/64-inch opening from depths of between 6,000 feet and 6,576 feet. 

The oil company, which holds leases on more than 14,000 acres surrounding the well, said it plans to drill a second well to delineate the field.
