Tokyo stock prices rebounded, with the 225-stock Nikkei Index soaring past the record it set Tuesday. 

In London, shares fell sharply in thin trading marked by nervousness over interest rates and the pound's weakness. 

Tokyo's Nikkei index climbed steadily from the opening to end at its high of 35689.98, up 319.41.
The newly strengthened yen made investors feel secure about buying, traders said.
The dollar, under selling pressure from central banks since the weekend meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, ended the Tokyo trading session at 140.85 yen, down from 141.35 Wednesday. 

In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index rose 84.33 points to 35774.31.
The yen opened for trading at 140.60 yen, down from Thursday's Tokyo close of 140.85 yen. 

Thursday's volume on the First Section was estimated at one billion shares, compared with 1.06 billion Wednesday.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 627-334, with 167 unchanged. 

The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the first section, which gained 6.44 points Wednesday, was up 14.52, or 0.54%, at 2696.18.
The second section index, which rose 16.09 Wednesday, was up 25.48, or 0.72%, to 3556.05. 

Yesterday's advance was helped by index-linked investment trust fund buying.
An official at Nikko Securities said about 500 billion yen ($35.7 billion) is expected to be invested on the stock market through trust funds this week.
Because these funds buy a wide range of issues in the Nikkei Index, they provide considerable support and reduce the risk of a sharp fall, traders said. 

Some issues that advanced earlier in the week were sold on profit-taking, but others emerged as winners, reflecting rotational investor buying, traders said. 

Yesterday's main participants were individuals who sought quick profit regardless of sectors, traders said. 

Some institutional investors also sought quick profits, while most others avoided committing fully to the market, anticipating currency volatility, fund managers said. 

A fund manager at Nippon Life Insurance said many trust funds that had closed their books for the first half of the fiscal year, which ends this weekend, decided to come in to cover losses in certain stocks. 

Hiroyuki Murai, general manager of the stock trading division at Nikko Securities, said trading was characterized by selective buying of individual issues, making it difficult to categorize gainers by groups. 

Investors are likely to rotate buy orders in a short cycle this week and next, he said. 

Yesterday's most notable winner was Fuji Photo Film, which gained 200 to 4,940 yen ($35.25) a share.
Traders said the company's strong earnings outlook and lower price-earnings ratio attracted investors. 

Pioneer and Fanuc rebounded from their early lows.
Pioneer gained 150 to 5,450, and Fanuc rose 50 to 8,000. 

Housing issues went up with the help of buying by major brokerage houses, a trader said.
Misawa Homes was up 80 at 2,950, and Sekisui House gained 20 to 2,500. 

Some chemical issues were bought because of their laggard status, traders said.
Kanegafuchi Chemical Industry advanced 50 to 1,130. 

Other winners included Canon, up 40 to 1,960.
Sumitomo Realty & Development was up 60 at 2,180, and Mitsubishi Estate gained 40 to 2,520. 

In London trading, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended at its session low of 2291.7, down 39.5, its lowest close since July 27. 

The Financial Times 30-share index finished 31.2 points lower at 1876.2.
Volume fell to 403.5 million shares from 428.9 million Wednesday. 

Dealers said shares drifted lower throughout the session on investor worries that U.K. interest rates will need to be pushed higher to support the pound.
Technical-chart indicators are also looking weak in the short term, some dealers said, pointing to the FT-SE 100's close below its 2300 support level. 

The pound's softening against the West German currency to 3.028 marks late in the session helped propel the market into deeper declines at the close and was the main cause of concern that a rate increase might be needed.
The concern has been evident since Tuesday, when Britain posted its third widest trade and current account deficit ever for a single month. 

Dealers said the market was quiet ahead of today's close of the two-week trading account, end of the third quarter and expiration of stock-index futures and options contracts. 

The options and futures expirations didn't appear to have a significant influence on the market's slide, they said, but the lack of volume helped to deepen the decline. 

Among major issues, composite insurers were strong on talk that a bid was about to emerge for one of the companies in the sector. 

Commercial Union was up 6 pence at 451 pence ($7.29) a share after trading as high as 457 on rumors of possible stakebuilding by Sun Alliance, which fell 4 to 314.
Royal Insurance fell 3 to 454, General Accident advanced 9 to #11.05, and Guardian Royal was unchanged at 225. 

Some market-watchers suggested that the sector gained momentum on the recent takeover of insurer Groupe Victoire by Cie.
Financiere de Suez in the largest takeover attempt launched in France to date. 

Cadbury-Schweppes also finished firmer at 389, up 4, on news that Sony agreed to acquire Columbia Pictures Entertainment, including the 49% stake owned by Coca-Cola.
There is speculation Coca-Cola will launch a bid for the British soft drinks concern and confectioner.
Cadbury already has a joint venture with Coke in the U.K. 

Pharmaceuticals were hit by foreign-exchange factors and concern over U.S. competition, dealers said. 

Wellcome, developer of a drug aimed at combating immune deficiency syndrome, fell 28 to 645, SmithKline Beecham dropped 38 to #24.75, and Reckitt & Colman slid 33 to #11.75. 

Elsewhere, Scottish & Newcastle Breweries sold its Thistle Hotels chain to Mount Charlotte, a medium-sized U.K. hotelier, for #645 million.
The announcement had been widely expected.
Scottish & Newcastle fell 12 to 354, while Mount Charlotte ended 1/2 higher at 83 1/2. 

In other European markets, shares closed higher in Paris, Zurich, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Milan and were lower in Frankfurt and Brussels.
South African gold stocks closed lower. 

Elsewhere, prices rose in Hong Kong, Seoul and Wellington and were mixed in Manila, little changed in Sydney and lower in Singapore.
The Taipei market was closed for a holiday.
