Fiat S.p.
A. said group pretax profit rose 27% to 2.807 trillion lire ($2.06 billion) in the first half of 1989 from 2.202 trillion lire a year earlier. 

The Italian auto maker said group sales rose 19% to 27.107 trillion lire in the first six months from 22.686 trillion lire in the January-June period of 1988. 

Fiat said the results weren't adjusted for changes that occurred in the group during the course of the first six months, such as the acquisition of construction company Cogefar S.p.
A. and the sale of Fila by its SNIA BPD unit.
It said the results were also affected by a change in the method used for consolidating the results of its financial services subsidiary Fidis. 

The Turin-based company, which is Italy's largest private-sector industrial group, said sales rose 15% on an adjusted basis, but it didn't disclose any other adjusted results. 

Fiat, which is controlled by the Agnelli family, predicted continued growth in the second half and said group sales "should exceed 52 trillion lire" in all of 1990, compared with 44.3 trillion lire in 1988.
