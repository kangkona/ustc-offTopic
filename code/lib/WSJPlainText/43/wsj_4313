Maxicare Health Plans Inc., Los Angeles, said it reached an agreement with its court-appointed committees of creditors on economic terms of its plan of reorganization. 

The health maintenance concern said it would not disclose the terms until it files its plan of reorganization with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in October.
It did state that under the terms, the company will distribute cash, debt and/or equity securities to creditors and shareholders.
A spokesman for the company said Maxicare put out an announcement to counter speculation that it would be unable to reach agreement with creditors. 

Maxicare has 400,000 members, down by about one-third from when it and its 40 units filed last March for protection under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law, under which it can continue to operate, sheltered from creditor lawsuits, as it devises a debt-payment plan.
