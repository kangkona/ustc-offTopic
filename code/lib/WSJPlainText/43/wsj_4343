Malaysia Airlines ordered Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines valued at $435 million for as many as 16 Airbus Industrie A-330 airliners. 

Malaysia Airlines had said it was ordering eight A-330 twinjets and taking options on eight more.
Pratt & Whitney will supply Malaysia with 20 PW4000 engines, including spares, valued at $210 million for the eight aircraft on firm order. 

If Malaysia takes all eight optioned aircraft, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp., of Hartford, Conn., would supply the airline with 20 additional engines valued at about $225 million.
