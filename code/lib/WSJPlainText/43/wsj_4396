EMC Corp. said it will post lower-than-expected revenue and net income for the third quarter. 

Production during what is normally the busiest shipping period of the quarter was temporarily halted in Puerto Rico by Hurricane Hugo.
As a result, the maker of circuit boards for mid-range computers said it will not improve on the $34.6 million in revenue posted for the second quarter of this year. 

Third-quarter revenue in 1988 was $28.9 million. 

Fourth-quarter net and revenue may also be affected by the company's backlog, EMC said.
