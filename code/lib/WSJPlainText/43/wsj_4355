Benetton Group S.p.
A., Rome, said consolidated net income dropped 12% to 54.7 billion lire ($39.9 million) in the first half of 1989 from 62.4 billion lire a year earlier. 

The casual wear company blamed the decline in earnings on narrower profit margins resulting from "an attentive pricing policy aimed at increasing and maintaining market share." It also blamed a change in the schedule of merchandise shipments. 

Benetton said it will compensate for these problems in the second half so it can maintain its "high level of profitability" for all of 1989. 

The drop in earnings came despite a 19% rise in consolidated sales to 836 billion lire from 702 billion lire a year earlier.
Benetton said it expects full-year sales to reach 1.7 trillion lire, up 15% from 1.475 trillion lire a year earlier. 

Benetton also said that based on orders received for next year, it expects "satisfactory results" in 1990.
