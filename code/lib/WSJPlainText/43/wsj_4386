The Philippine trade deficit reached $1.39 billion during the first seven months of the year, twice as wide as its $693 million level a year earlier. 

This year's trade gap reflects a six-year high and surpasses the $1.09 billion deficit for all of 1988, as imports continued to significantly outpace exports. 

The Philippines' central bank said the country's import receipts totaled $5.84 billion from January to July this year, up 29% from $4.52 billion a year ago. 

This compares with exports amounting to $4.45 billion, or 15% higher than $3.88 billion during the period.
