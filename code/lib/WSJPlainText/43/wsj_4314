Saskatchewan's provincial government plans to offer the public about 13 million common shares in Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. to raise as much as 260 million Canadian dollars (US$220.8 million). 

The shares represent about 37% of the total equity of the producer of potash fertilizer and will be priced between C$18 (US$15.29) and C$20 each, according to a preliminary prospectus filed by the provincially owned company.
The offering, expected by the end of October, will be made in Canada, the U.S. and internationally. 

The government also plans a separate offering of C$100 million of "ownership bonds," available initially only to Saskatchewan residents.
The bonds would be convertible into common shares after one year at the initial share price. 

While the government will retain a 63% stake in Potash, the prospectus said it doesn't intend to take a management role or vote its shares at shareholder meetings, although it reserves the right to do so.
Assuming full conversion of the bonds and exercise of other options, the government's fully diluted holding would amount to 45%. 

Other than the province, no individual shareholder will be allowed to own more than 5% of the company's equity.
The prospectus also said the combined holding by non-residents of Canada will be limited to 45%, and the combined foreign voting interest can't exceed 25% on any single resolution.
A majority of the board of Potash also must be resident Canadians.
