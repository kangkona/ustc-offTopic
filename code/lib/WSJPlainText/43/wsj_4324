New York lawyer Martin S. Ackerman filed a counterclaim in Chancery Court in Delaware, accusing Datapoint Corp. Chairman Asher B. Edelman and companies he controls of improperly purchasing Datapoint shares in an effort to block Mr. Ackerman's attempt to oust the company's board of directors, including Mr. Edelman. 

In the suit, Mr. Ackerman alleges that Datapoint, Intelogic Trace Inc., Canal Capital Corp. and Mr. Edelman "admitted" in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that they bought up to 30% of Datapoint's stock in anticipation of the battle over the board seats. 

Mr. Ackerman contends in the suit that Mr. Edelman and his companies spent $17 million to buy the stock, endangering the companies' financial health. 

A spokeswoman for San Antonio-based Datapoint said the computer-products company has yet to review the suit.
Mr. Ackerman, she said, "has been sending us draft copies of the suit, and we've been advised by our lawyers that the claims are totally without merit." 

In a suit filed earlier this month, Datapoint accused Mr. Ackerman and a group of shareholders of violating SEC rules in their effort to oust Mr. Edelman.
The suit alleged that Mr. Ackerman and the dissident group contacted Datapoint shareholders without filing the proper proxy material.
The dissidents own about 4.5% of Datapoint's approximately 10 million shares outstanding.
