The Federal Trade Commission charged Schering Corp., a unit of Schering-Plough Corp., with making false and deceptive claims about a weight-control pill. 

The commission said Schering doesn't have sufficient evidence to back up its claim that the product, Fibre Trim, is an effective appetite suppressant.
It also said the company falsely advertised the pill as a high-fiber dietary supplement. 

The company has 30 days to respond to the charges, and may contest them during a formal administrative hearing.
The commissioners voted 4-0 to issue the complaint.
Chairman Janet Steiger didn't participate. 

A spokesman for Schering-Plough, a Madison, N.J., pharmaceutical company, said it will "vigorously" defend itself against the FTC charges, and plans to continue selling the product.
He said internal studies have shown that fiber, along with proper diet and exercise, can be used to help people lose weight.
Fibre Trim is sold in three forms, a tablet, a calcium-supplemented tablet and a fruit-flavored tablet that dissolves in water.
