Dravo Corp. said it filed a $147 million claim against Long Beach, Calif., because the city has rejected a waste-to-energy plant built by the natural-resources company. 

Dravo said the three-boiler plant was completed in December, and improvements in the facility have been made.
The plant currently operates fully. 

Earlier this month, however, Long Beach rejected the plant, saying it didn't meet its specifications. 

Dravo said the city's failure to accept the plant wouldn't affect the company's reserves for discontinued operations.
