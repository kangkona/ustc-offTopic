Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it raised the rating of about $25 million of Seagull's convertible exchangeable preferred stock, to Ba-2 from single-B-2.
The ratings concern said the upgrade is based on the belief that the Houston natural gas transmission and marketing concern can sustain its improved financial performance, and assumes that there will be future improvement in gas demand and pricing.
Additionally, Moody's said the rating takes into account Seagull's relatively aggressive but manageable use of debt to finance periodic acquisitions.
