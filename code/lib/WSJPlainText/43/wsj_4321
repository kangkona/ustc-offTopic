Campeau Corp. said its board decided to forgo dividend payments of $101 million on its preference shares because of the company's liquidity needs. 

The dividends were scheduled to be paid Saturday on Campeau's Series B, C, and D preference shares and on its convertible subordinate shares.
The company said it will review the payment of the dividends, which are cumulative, before year end. 

Olympia & York Developments Ltd. last week agreed to loan Campeau $250 million, in part to help it meet liquidity needs. 

Campeau common stock has fallen sharply on the Toronto Stock Exchange in the past two days.
Yesterday it closed at 9.50 Canadian dollars (US$8.07), down C$1.875, after falling C$1.25 Wednesday.
