Syntex Corp. said a U.S. district court in New Jersey ruled that a generic drug sold by a rival to treat psoriasis and other skin disorders infringed upon a Syntex patent for its Lidex cream products.
Syntex said that as a result of the ruling against T.J. Roaco Ltd., it would seek "full compensation" for the infringement at a trial ordered by the court on Nov. 6. 

Syntex, a health-care company based in Palo Alto, Calif., declined to estimate damages.
A company spokesman said the ruling sends "a message that Syntex will vigorously enforce its patent against distributors." 

T.J. Roaco is a drug distribution concern with its headquarters in New York and its principal operations in Toronto.
Officials couldn't be reached for comment on the ruling.
