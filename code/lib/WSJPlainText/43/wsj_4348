Imperial Corp. of America said it will take a charge of $75 million to $80 million in the third quarter to write down its high-yield bond portfolio, pointing the way to a substantial loss for the period. 

The write-down of the junk bond holding is required by recent thrift legislation and accounting interpretations.
Imperial Corp., the parent of Imperial Savings, is based in San Diego. 

The thrift holding company also said it sold about $795 million of assets in the third quarter, as part of its earlier-reported plan to reduce assets by $2 billion. 

Imperial said the asset sales will produce a net loss of $1.4 million in the third quarter and it warned that there will be additional consumer loan losses as well as charges for write-downs of other assets. 

In total, the prospective loss for the third quarter appeared certain to exceed $75 million, although Imperial Corp. declined to estimate the final figure.
In the year-ago third quarter, Imperial earned $13 million, or 90 cents a share. 

Imperial Corp. shares closed yesterday at $3.625, up 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
