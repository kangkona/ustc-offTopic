Thirteen states offered to settle an antitrust suit involving a joint venture by Visa and MasterCard to develop a national debit card. 

The lawsuit, filed June 26 in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, alleged that Visa and MasterCard conspired to prevent other companies from introducing a national debit card by dragging their feet in bringing out their card. 

A debit card can be presented at stores like a credit card, but the money is automatically transferred from the cardholder's account to the merchant's. 

"I think there is a unique opportunity for a settlement in this case now," said Lloyd Costantine, the chief of the antitrust unit of the state attorney general's office in New York.
Costantine spoke on behalf of all the states who brought the complaint. 

Lawyers for Visa U.S.A. Inc. and MasterCard International Inc. said they were willing to discuss the offer. 

The lawsuit charged that the companies undermined competition through the joint venture, called Entree, and by gaining control of the nation's two largest automatic teller machine networks. 

The settlement offer calls on Visa and MasterCard to drop the Entree venture.
In exchange, the states will drop their efforts to compel Visa and MasterCard to divest from Cirrus, Plus and Interlink.
