Scottish & Newcastle Breweries PLC, a British brewing and leisure concern, has agreed to sell its Thistle Hotels chain to Mount Charlotte Investments PLC for #645 million ($1.04 billion), the companies said. 

Mount Charlotte, a midsized U.K. hotels operator, said it intends to pay #581 million immediately and a further #64 million in September 1990. 

The purchase will be financed in part by the sale to existing shareholders of one new Mount Charlotte share for every three already owned.
The rights issue is expected to raise #151.4 million.
The balance of the purchase will be financed through bank borrowings, Mount Charlotte said. 

Scottish & Newcastle had said earlier this year it would sell its Thistle chain as part of the company's effort to focus its activities around beer brewing and distrubition and leisure activities.
