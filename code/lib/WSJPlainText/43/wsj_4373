Despite all the attention being paid the Catastrophic Health Care Act, one major element of tax discrimination against the elderly has been ignored -- the marriage tax penalty, exacerbated by the catastrophic surtax. 

The additional income tax a married couple has to pay above what two unmarried people with the same total income would pay, can be much larger for the elderly than for the rest of the population.
That penalty (including the Catastrophic Health Care surtax) can exceed $3,000 for some elderly couples.
And the largest marriage penalties are incurred by the middle-income elderly. 

As an example, consider Mary and Tom Blake, who are both over 65 and eligible for Medicare coverage and who each receive $23,000 of taxable pension and interest income and $10,500 of Social Security benefits.
Assuming the Blakes take the standard deduction, they will have to pay a 1989 federal income tax of $10,215.50 -- regular income tax of $8,884.50 and a Catastrophic Health Care Act surtax of $1,331.
That $10,215.50 of tax is $3,676.50 larger than the $6,539 of combined income tax (including $828 of catastrophic surtax) they would have paid on the same income had they been unmarried.
The Blakes have to pay 56% more in taxes because they are married. 

The marriage tax penalty for the Blakes and their real-life counterparts is mainly due to four factors: 

1.
The combined base amount of income for determining the tax on Social Security benefits of two unmarried people is $50,000 ($25,000 each), while it is $32,000 for a married couple.
This accounts for $2,030 of the Blakes' marriage tax penalty. 

2.
Two unmarried elderly individuals can take a total standard deduction of $7,700 ($3,850 each), while an elderly married couple is entitled only to a $6,400 standard deduction.
This is responsible for $328 of the Blakes' marriage penalty. 

3.
The catastrophic surtax of 15% is imposed on the income tax of a married couple (up to a maximum of $1,600), while it is imposed on the separate income-tax amounts of unmarried persons (up to a maximum of $800).
This accounts for $483 of the Blakes' marriage tax penalty. 

4.
The rest of the penalty is due to differential tax-rate schedules that cause joint married incomes to reach higher tax brackets faster than the separate and lower incomes of single people. 

Congress could go a long way toward eliminating the marriage tax penalty of the elderly by making the following changes in the tax code: 

1.
Make the base amount of income in the Social Security benefits formula twice as large for the married as for the unmarried -- that is, either raise the base for marrieds to $50,000 or lower that for singles to $16,000. 

2.
Make the standard deduction for married elderly couples twice as large as the standard deduction for each unmarried elderly person. 

3.
Eliminate the catastrophic surtax by modifying the legislation or, better yet, repealing the entire act.
