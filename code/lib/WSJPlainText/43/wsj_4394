Revco D.S. Inc. said it agreed to sell its Insta-Care Pharmacy Services Corp. unit to Jack Eckerd Corp. for $7.1 million.
The sale is scheduled to close Oct. 

Last year Revco filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditor lawsuits while it tries to work out a plan to pay its debts.
The drugstore chain said proceeds of the sale would be used to pay a portion of court-ordered reclamation claims to trade suppliers. 

Insta-Care, based in Woburn, Mass., provides pharmacy services to nursing homes, prisons and other institutions.
Jack Eckerd is based in Largo, Fla.
