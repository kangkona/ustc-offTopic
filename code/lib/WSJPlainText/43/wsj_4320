Financiere de Paribas reported a 36% rise in its first-half profit and revised its full-year forecast upward to show a gain of about 30% from a year earlier. 

The French financial holding company said that its group profit after payments to minority interests rose to 1.91 billion francs ($299.9 million) from 1.4 billion francs in the first half of 1988. 

The advance was led by profit from the group's portfolio of securities, which jumped 52% to 874 million francs from 576 million a year earlier.
Paribas said the gain reflected profit from industrial companies in which it has a stake, plus gains on the sale of securities.
It didn't elaborate. 

Profit from traditional banking activities was also strong, with a rise to 1.04 billion francs from 826 million in the first half of 1988.
The group said all its majority-held bank interests contributed to the advance.
Its Credit du Nord retail bank unit continued its recovery with a first-half profit of 62.7 million francs, in contrast to a year-earlier loss of 2.6 million francs.
