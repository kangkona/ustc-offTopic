American Western Corp. said it signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by Carlisle Plastics Inc. for $12.50 a share. 

American Western, a maker of plastic bag products, said the purchase price, including debt assumption and equity, is expected to be $115 million. 

Earlier this month, American Western agreed in principle to be acquired by the Boston, Mass.-based plastics concern, for $13 a share.
The transaction is expected to be completed in early January. 

John L. Mulligan, chairman of American Western, said the per-share price was reduced because of "higher-than-anticipated transaction costs" disclosed in the due diligence review.
