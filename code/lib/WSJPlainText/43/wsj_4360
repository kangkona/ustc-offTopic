Assets of 468 money-market mutual funds rose $191.6 million in the week ended Wednesday as assets in individual accounts registered net deposits for the 18th consecutive week. 

Even with a decrease of nearly a half-billion dollars in institutional money, total assets stood at a record $349.23 billion, the Investment Company Institute said. 

"As the yields offered by money-market funds stayed unchanged in both absolute terms and relative to yields available elsewhere, there was little to induce substantial asset flows," said Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist of the Washington-based trade group. 

Institutional-type funds "continued to experience moderate erosion of assets," he said.
But the 18-week rise in individual accounts matched the longest uninterrupted streak of weekly increases since 1981, he added. 

The 141 institutional funds fell $453.6 million to $83.76 billion.
Of the individual-type funds, 231 general-purpose funds added $199.1 million to $113.4 billion, while 96 broker-dealer funds increased $446.1 million to $152.07 billion. 

Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass., newsletter, said average money-fund yields were unchanged in the week ended Tuesday.
For example, the compounded yield remained at 8.60% for both the seven-day and 30-day methods of averaging fund yields. 

The average yield on a six-month CD, a competing type of investment, was 8.04% in the week ended Tuesday, compared with 8.01% a week earlier, according to New York information service Banxquote Money Markets.
