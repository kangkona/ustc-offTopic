Three of the nation's biggest airlines have reached a preliminary agreement to form a computer reservation system. 

Delta Air Lines Inc., Trans World Airlines Inc. and NWA Inc. 's Northwest Airlines unit said they tentatively plan to form a joint venture that would develop, own and market a global computer reservation system. 

If the venture materializes, Delta would greatly increase the ability of travel agents to book its flights: its own Datas II system is only the fifth-largest in the industy.
Travel agents use the reservation systems of the major airlines to book airline, car-rental, hotel and other reservations. 

Earlier this year, the government blocked on antitrust grounds Delta's plan to combine its Datas II system with the biggest system in the U.S., the Sabre reservation system of AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines. 

Under the latest venture proposed by Delta, it would combine its system with the PARS reservation system jointly operated by TWA and Northwest.
Delta would also pay $48 million to TWA. 

Under the agreement, Delta would own 40%, Northwest would own one-third and TWA 26% of the new company. 

The agreement is subject to the signing of a definitive pact as well as certain other conditions, including approval of all three companies' directors.
