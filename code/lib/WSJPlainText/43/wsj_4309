Insight Communications Co. said it is selling all of its cable television systems in California, Arizona, Utah, Texas, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Indiana and Kentucky. 

The closely held, New York-based company said it is hoping for a price of about $500 million for the systems, which have about 190,000 subscribers.
The sale is being handled by Communications Equity Associates of Tampa, Fla.
Insight said it is selling the systems because it is planning to redeploy assets in order to develop a cable system in the U.K.
