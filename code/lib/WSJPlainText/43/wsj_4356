Alltel Corp., Hudson, Ohio, said it expects to expand its cellular telephone operations to rural areas.
Analysts estimated the move would increase the value of Alltel's operations by as much as $260 million. 

The company didn't dispute the analysts' estimate.
It did say, however, that it expects the Federal Communications Commission to approve construction of cellular operating sites by the end of the year. 

The company, which operates local telephone companies and distributes telecommunications equipment, plans to provide cellular services to rural areas in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Missouri, Nevada and North Carolina.
