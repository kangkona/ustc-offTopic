Tandy Corp., Fort Worth, Texas, said that its GRiD Systems Corp. subsidiary reached an agreement on cross-licensing of patents with Toshiba Corp. for the manufacture, use and sale of laptop computers.
Terms weren't disclosed. 

In April, GRiD filed suit against Toshiba in a San Francisco federal court, seeking to enforce what it considered fundamental patents for laptop computers. 

The company said yesterday it is currently negotiating with several other laptop makers regarding its patents. 

If the Toshiba agreement is a standard licensing agreement, said Michelle Preston, a Salomon Bros. analyst, it will cover 1% to 2% of Tandy's sales volume.
But since GRiD is licensing some Toshiba technology, she said, it's hard to assess the impact on Tandy earnings.
