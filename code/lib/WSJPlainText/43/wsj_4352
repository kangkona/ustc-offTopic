The Anglo/Dutch truck-maker DAF N.V. said it has submitted an offer to acquire Spain's state-owned Empresa Nacional de Autocamiones S.A. Terms weren't disclosed. 

DAF said it was one of four companies whose bids were invited and now are being considered by the Spanish truck-maker's parent Instituto Nacional de Industria, the big state industrial holding company that has a publicly stated policy of cutting back its substantial massive holdings in Spanish industry. 

The other three bids include a joint offer from West Germany's Daimler-Benz AG and MAN AG, as well as FIAT S.p.
A.'s truck affiliate Iveco and AB Volvo, of Sweden, a DAF spokesman said. 

The DAF official said it isn't clear when the Spanish government will make a final decision on the winning bid. 

Should it win the auction for the Spanish concern, DAF would become Europe's third largest truck-maker, behind Iveco and Daimler's Mercedes truck division.
