Vickers PLC, a British defense and engineering concern, said its pretax profit for the first half of the year increased 31%, largely from interest income associated with the sale of its Howson-Algraphy lithographic plate business to Du Pont Co. 

Pretax profit in the period was #32 million ($51.7 million), up from #24.5 million ($39.6 million) a year earlier.
Earnings per share rose 30%, to 8.6 pence (13.9 cents) from 6.6 pence (10.7 cents) in the comparable 1988 period. 

Profit after tax and extraordinary items, or net profit attributable to shareholders, was #148.1 million, up sharply from #16.5 million a year earlier. 

Net income was sharply boosted by an extraordinary gain of #125.7 million from the sale of Howson-Algraphy, while the 1988 net had been reduced by an extraordinary charge of #500,000.
