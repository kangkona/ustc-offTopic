Playboy Enterprises Inc. said it will record a pretax gain of about $5 million in its fiscal first quarter ending Sept. 30 from the sale of its Boarts International Inc. subsidiary. 

The Chicago-based publishing and entertainment concern said it sold the assets of Boarts, which is an international distributor of U.S. periodicals and paperback books, to Worldwide Media Service Inc.
Under the terms of the agreement, Worldwide Media will continue to distribute Playboy magazine and other Playboy publications overseas. 

In the year-earlier first quarter, the company earned $445,000, or five cents a share, on revenue of $37.3 million.
