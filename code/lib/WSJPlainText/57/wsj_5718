MCA Inc. 's Universal Pictures said that for only the third time in a decade, one studio commanded the top three positions on the weekend's box office chart. 

The studio, of course, was Universal, propelled by "Sea of Love," which grossed more than $10 million in its opening weekend on 1,246 screens. "Uncle Buck," which had been No. 1 for four weeks, finished in second place; "Parenthood" was third. 

None of these films is a blockbuster of "Batman" or "Indiana Jones" proportions, but they typify what Universal has been doing all year: releasing a slate of movies at strategically attractive times when competition is minimal, then doing solid if unspectacular business. 

Some of the films, such as "Fletch Lives," "K-9," "The Dream Team" and "The 'burbs," flamed out quickly, but had opened strongly enough to avert disaster.
Others, such as "Field of Dreams," "Do the Right Thing," "Parenthood" and now "Uncle Buck," have had impressive "legs" -- they play week after week with relatively little audience erosion. 

When all this is combined, Universal has kept its head above water in the annual battle for market share, after a several-year drought that ended with last Christmas's "Twins." And for 1989, possible blockbusters like "Back to the Future II" and Steven Spielberg's "Always" are yet to come. 

According to Universal, the only times in the past 10 years when one studio released the top three films were in 1987 when Paramount had "Critical Condition," Star Trek IV" and "The Golden Child," and 1983 when Warner Brothers had "National Lampoon's Vacation," "Cujo" and "Risky Business."
