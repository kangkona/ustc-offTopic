Mesa Limited Partnership, straining under the double burden of low gas prices and hefty debt payments incurred in last year's acquisition of Tenneco Inc. properties, declared lower third-quarter distributions and hinted at additional lower payouts. 

The oil and gas producer declared distributions of 37 1/2 cents for each common unit and for each preference A unit, payable Nov. 17 to holders of record Oct. 6.
The distribution in the second quarter had been 50 cents per unit. 

A Mesa spokesman said the partnership expects to make fourth-quarter distributions at the same rate, but cautioned that "further developments in industry conditions" could dictate a change.
One of those developments is a Sept. 15 federal court ruling that could result in industrywide refunds of as much as $100 million to natural gas consumers. 

Mesa has nearly $400 million in debt from its Tenneco acquisition and finished the second quarter with a net loss of $13.4 million.
