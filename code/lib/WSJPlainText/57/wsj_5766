The U.S. sales unit of Mazda Motor Corp. said it estimates it will sell 316,000 cars in the U.S. in 1990 and garner a 3% share of the car market. 

William Hackett, marketing vice president for Mazda Motor of America Inc., said Mazda expects industrywide car sales in the nation to reach 9.7 million next year.
Mazda expects to sell 288,000 cars this year. 

Mr. Hackett announced the projections at a ceremony here to kick off U.S. production of Mazda's 626 compact sedan.
Mazda said 25%, or 60,000 units, of the plant's output here in 1990 will be its 626 models.
Mazda already builds its MX-6 sporty compact model and the Probe sporty compact for Ford Motor Co. at the plant.
According to Mazda, 60%, or 144,000, of the 240,000 cars it will build next year will be Ford Probes.
The remaining 36,000 units will be MX-6s. 

Mazda, which began building cars at the plant two years ago, says the domestic content of its vehicles will reach 65% for the 1990 model year and is expected to reach between 70% and 75% by 1992.
