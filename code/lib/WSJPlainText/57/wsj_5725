Landmark Graphics Corp. said it will report earnings of about 20 cents a share for its first quarter ending Sept. 30, failing to meet analysts' expectations of 24 cents a share. 

In the year-earlier quarter, Landmark had earnings of 21 cents a share. 

Gene Ennis, the computer maker's president and chief executive, blamed the disappointing earnings on uncertainty among potential buyers of computer-aided exploration workstations, used by oil companies. "There is a great deal of real and projected new product activity" among vendors of these workstations, Mr. Ennis said, creating the fear among customers that the equipment they buy may soon be obsolete. 

To answer such concerns, Landmark also announced a "perpetual trade-up plan." According to Mr. Ennis, buyers of Landmark workstations now can trade their new hardware for more-advanced Landmark equipment introduced within a year of delivery of the original equipment. 

Landmark has more than 360 workstations installed world-wide.
It posted net income of $5.1 million on sales of $41.4 million for the year ended June 30.
