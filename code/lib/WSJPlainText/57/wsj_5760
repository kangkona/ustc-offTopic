The World Bank approved a $224 million loan to Chile for road-construction projects to be carried out over the next four years. 

World Bank officials said other financing for the construction of roads, bridges and other highway facilities in Chile will be provided by Japan's Export-Import Bank, about $150 million, and the 44-nation Inter-American Development Bank, $85 million. 

The total cost of the road projects, to be carried out by Chile's ministry of public works, will be about $907 million in the 1990-1993 period, the World Bank said. 

In other action, the World Bank cleared two loans, totaling $80.5 million, for housing projects in Morocco, particularly in low-income urban areas of the North African country. 

Separately, the International Development Association, a World Bank affiliate, approved a $40 million credit to Mozambique to cover part of the estimated $345 million cost of a major transport project. 

World Bank officials said Mozambique will rehabilitate and upgrade rail, highway, pipeline and other facilities in the transport corridor linking several African countries, including Zimbabwe and Malawi, with Mozambique's Indian Ocean port of Beira, which will compete with South Africa's port of Durban in handling various cargoes. 

The World Bank said its loans to Chile and Morocco will carry variable lending rates, currently 7.73% a year, while the IDA financing for the transport project in Mozambique will be interest-free except for administrative fees.
