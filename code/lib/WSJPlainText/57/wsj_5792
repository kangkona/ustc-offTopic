President Carlos Salinas de Gortari gave the strongest signal yet that the government would cede majority control of Mexico's 56%-owned telephone monopoly to private investors when a new national telecommunications strategy is unveiled this week. 

Telefonos de Mexico "ended up in the hands of the state because before it wasn't adequately administered" as a private-sector company, Mr. Salinas said yesterday in a speech to the phone workers union. "Nevertheless, the Mexican state doesn't have sufficient resources to achieve its adequate growth." 

Mr. Salinas never referred specifically to a privatization of the phone company.
He did indicate that in the coming telecommunications revamp, Mexicans would retain a majority stake in the monopoly, known as Telmex. 

Mr. Salinas also praised telephone workers union leader Francisco Hernandez Juarez, who discussed the prospect of privatizing Telmex in unusually frank terms. "Privatizing permits overcoming . . . some problems of financing and administration in the short and medium term," Mr. Hernandez Juarez said.
He cautioned, however, that a greater private-sector role wouldn't solve all of Telmex's problems. 

Many foreign phone companies are interested in a stake in Telmex.
