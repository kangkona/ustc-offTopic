An investor group including Heinz C. Prechter, chairman of ASC Inc., Southgate, Mich., said it lowered its stake in HBO & Co. to 4.89% of the common shares outstanding. 

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group said it sold 272,000 common shares of the health-services concern between Aug. 17 and Sept. 7 for $12 to $12.625 a share.
The sales reduce the group's stake to 740,500 shares. 

No reason was given in the filing for the sales. 

A spokesman at Atlanta-based HBO said the company wasn't surprised by the group's move.
He said HBO's stock "just got to the price they were looking for." 

HBO stock closed at $12.125, unchanged, in national over-the-counter trading yesterday.
