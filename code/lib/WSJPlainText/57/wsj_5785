R.H. Macy & Co. said in a letter to its investors that pretax earnings before interest and depreciation were $925 million on sales of about $7 billion in fiscal 1989, which ended July 29. 

The New York-based retail company, which went private in a leveraged buy-out in July 1986, said in the letter yesterday: "In light of the well-publicized difficulties experienced by the Hooker and Campeau corporations and the resultant general market reactions, we felt it important to reiterate for you the strengths of our company so that you are informed and as comfortable as we are about our financial condition." 

Macy said pretax earnings in fiscal 1988 were $833.6 million on sales of $6.6 billion.
Those results are pro-forma and include Bullock's and I. Magnin, which Macy acquired in May 1988.
Same-store sales in fiscal 1989 rose 7.2% from a year earlier, the retailer added. 

The letter was signed by Edward S. Finkelstein, Macy chairman and chief executive officer, and Mark S. Handler, president and chief operating officer.
Macy said it will file its financial report for the fiscal year with the Securities and Exchange Commission in mid-October. 

Macy also said it has completed its previously announced offering of $200 million of 8.9% credit-card backed notes as part of a $400 million transaction that also will include $200 million of commercial paper.
The transaction, Macy said, "reduces the cost of financing our accounts receivables," with a savings of about $9 million in fiscal 1990 and "as much as $20 million in future years."
