Magna International Inc. said it postponed plans to offer a minority of shares to the public of its Decoma International Inc. and Cosma International Inc. units. 

Magna, a Markham, Ontario, auto parts manufacturer, said it delayed the sale to give it additional time to "more fully develop the operating mandates and related management responsibilities for its proposed public companies." Magna officials couldn't be reached for comment. 

Magna had planned to sell as much as 25% of the equity of each unit to raise a total of about 114 million Canadian dollars (US$96.2 million), which was to be used to reduce debt.
