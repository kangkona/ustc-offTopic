Exports, domestic sales and production by Japan's two largest car makers, Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co., grew from the year-earlier levels in August owing to brisk demand in Japan and overseas. 

"Domestic demand is pretty strong because of this long economic expansion, and demand in other countries, especially in the U.S. and Europe, is also good," one Nissan official said. 

Exports by Toyota, the country's largest auto maker, rose 5.4% to 127,676 units, marking the fourth-consecutive year-to-year gain.
Toyota officials said introduction of new models led to the stepped-up exports.
Exports to the U.S., the largest overseas market, rose 5.2% to 57,911 units, while those to the European Community increased 4.3% to 25,137 units. 

Though the market is small, Australia showed a 40% surge, with shipments totaling 4,605 units.
Demand in Australia and New Zealand has been strong in recent months.
Toyota's overall exports to Oceania climbed 56% to 8,037 units. 

Nissan's overall August exports came to 83,826 units, a 5.5% rise.
August was the fourth-consecutive month in which its exports registered a year-to-year rise. 

Nissan's overseas shipments were also sustained by healthy demand in the U.S. and Europe.
Exports to the U.S. climbed 42% to 31,132 units, while those to Europe went up 22% to 33,156 units. 

Toyota's domestic sales of cars, trucks and buses jumped 17% to 118,019 units in August, a record for the month exceeding the previous high of 107,166 units set in August 1973.
As a result of the gain, Toyota officials said, their company's share in the domestic market grew 0.5 percentage point from a year earlier to 28%.
Nissan's domestic sales rose 28% to 78,271, pushing its domestic market share 1.3 percentage point from a year ago to 25%. 

Steady demand in Japan and overseas drove Toyota's production in August up 12% from the year-earlier level to 248,367 units.
This was the first time in two months that Toyota's production surpassed the year-earlier levels. 

Nissan's August output was 171,185 units, up 20% from a year ago.
Car output set a record for the month of August, totaling 146,302 units, Nissan officials said.
