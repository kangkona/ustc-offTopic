Tokyo stocks closed higher, but a wait-and-see mood caused by late currency fluctuations and lower bond prices kept the turnover small. 

London stocks also finished higher in thin trading, and gains were concentrated in selected issues. 

The Tokyo market was helped by moderate gains made by housing-related issues, traders said.
Index-related buying by investment trust funds also played a role, they noted. 

The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues rose 70.66 points to 34472.54.
It gained 114.94 points Thursday, the final trading day last week, as Friday was a holiday. 

In trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index rose 56.68 points to 34529.22 just after the opening. 

Volume on the First Section Monday was estimated at 450 million shares, down from 585 million Thursday. 

Advancing issues outnumbered declining issues, 483 to 436, while 199 remained unchanged. 

Institutional investors remained on the sidelines ahead of their midyear book closing and because of wild currency fluctuations overseas last Friday. 

On the other hand, housings, constructions, real estates and railways were pushed up by buy orders mostly from individual investors, traders said. 

Some traders noted rumors that major brokerage houses may recommend those issues.
The "Big Four" brokerage firms are set to hold their meetings later this week and decide on their most-recommended issues. 

The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed in the First Section, which gained 19.27 points Thursday, was up 3.80 points, or 0.15%, at 2622.23. 

The Second Section index, which climbed 9.27 points Thursday, was up 15.38 points, or 0.45%, to close at 3409.19. 

Volume in the second section was estimated at 18 million shares, down from 20 million Thursday. 

One of the Big Four brokerage houses will hold its meeting today.
Market rumors had it that it will set housing-related and consumption goods sectors as targets of its trading, a trader at Dai-ichi Securities said. 

Because of growing speculation that the other three major brokerage houses may set the similar targets, these issues received buy orders from individual investors entering the market before the prices go up, he added. 

Gainers among housing issues included Sekisui House, which went up 30 yen (20 cents) to 2,490 yen ($17).
Misawa Homes gained 60 to rise to 3,000 and Daiwa House added 30, standing at 2,660. 

Among real estates, Mitsubishi Estate advanced 60 to 2,460 and Sumitomo Realty was up 60 at 2,080. 

Railroads were expected to be included in most-recommended-issues lists because of their strong earnings prospects resulting from real estate they own, traders said. 

Odakyu Railway added 10 to 1,630 and Tokyu Corp. was up 50 to 1,920. 

Textile makers Nisshinbo and Toyobo advanced, helped by buy orders from dealers, traders said.
Nisshinbo gained 50 to 1,610 and Toyobo was up 16 to 891. 

Monday's losers included pharmaceuticals.
Ono Pharmaceuticals was down 50 to 6,220.
Taisho dropped 30 to 2,650 and Chugai fell 40 to 2,160. 

Machineries ended easier on profit-taking, traders said.
Amada was down 30 at 1,990.
Hitachi Seiki shed 10 to 1,280. 

Some steels scored gains after receiving buying orders from investors who decided the issues were scraping bottom.
Kobe Steel and Nippon Steel were among the gainers. 

London shares closed firmer in the wake of Wall Street's early advance. 

The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed at a session high of 2373.8, up 7.3. 

The narrower market barometer, the Financial Times 30-share index, finished at 1958.9, up 9.2.
Volume was 310.2 million shares, down sharply from 725.9 million Friday. 

Dealers acknowledged nagging concerns remain over whether Wall Street is open to a deeper correction after sharp losses last week.
But they added that sentiment was buoyed by the FT-SE 100's ability to rebound from an early low of 2358.3, down 8.2, to finish at its session high.
The day's high was reached shortly after New York opened firmer. 

The index's recovery was interpreted in some circles as a sign London could be poised to renew its test of higher levels, or is at least in less danger of moving below 2350, a major support point on technical charts. 

Whether concerns over New York and problems surrounding U.S. junk-bond financing are beginning to subside is still a point of debate.
Dealers still voiced caution given London's thin volume, which they said reflected uncertainty and the market's reluctance to aggressively position itself without further direction from Wall Street this week. 

Among major moving issues, Glaxo Holdings surged 24 pence (38 cents) in modest volume to #15.86 ($24.82).
Britain's biggest pharmaceutical company is slated to release full-year earnings today, with expectations that it will pierce the #1 billion pretax profit barrier for the first time. 

Fisons added 1 1/2 to 343 and Reckitt & Colman closed 4 higher at #12.18 in sympathy with Glaxo.
SmithKline Beecham, however, closed 3 lower at 591, and Wellcome settled at 668, down 6. 

Among ex-dividend stocks, Blue Circle lost 4 to 247, British Aerospace shed 10 to 638, United Biscuits dropped 2 to 391 and Cadbury Schweppes recovered from early losses to close 1 higher at 400.
Shell, another ex-dividend stock, fell 9 to 447. 

Oil stocks, however, performed well overall during the day.
And Shell may have followed if it hadn't been for ex-dividend factors, dealers said. 

British Petroleum closed at 318 1/2, up 3 1/2, Enterprise Oil at 589, up 1, and Burmah up 6 at 627.
Lasmo settled at 542, up 13. 

Dealers said oils were underpinned by expectations of improved market fundamentals, including greater cohesion within the pivotal Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC. 

Elsewhere, stock prices closed higher in Zurich and Brussels, mixed in Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Milan and lower in Stockholm.
South African gold stocks closed marginally firmer. 

Share prices closed higher in Taipei and Hong Kong, were mixed in Manila, lower in Seoul, Wellington and Singapore and little changed in Sydney.
