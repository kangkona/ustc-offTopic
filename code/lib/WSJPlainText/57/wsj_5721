Alan Gotlieb, former Canadian ambassador to the U.S., writing in the July 31, 1989 edition of the Globe & Mail newspaper, in Toronto: 

It is an astounding paradox that the American people return a congressional slate almost totally unchanged from election to election, while clamoring for "renewal" and a break with the past when choosing a president.
Almost all presidential candidates -- Nixon, Carter, Reagan, even John Kennedy -- run against "Washington" or the "system," codewords for an establishment thought to be out of touch with the real America.
Each new campaign is proclaimed a crusade to liberate the land from the foolish policies of the predecessor president.
It is as if the U.S. is in perpetual revolution.
