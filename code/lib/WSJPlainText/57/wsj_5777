ShowBiz Pizza Time Inc., Irving, Texas, said it expects to post a third-quarter loss because of its decision to close up to 26 of 52 "Monterey House" restaurants operated by one of its subsidiaries. 

The restaurant company anticipates the closings will result in an extraordinary charge of approximately $4.5 million before taxes, but also estimates gains of approximately $1 million from sale of the closed properties. 

Richard M. Frank, chairman and chief executive officer, said the stores will be closed as soon as possible because they have been "an annual $500,000 cash drag on the company." Restaurants targeted for closing are in Tulsa, Okla., Oklahoma City, Dallas and Houston. 

The Monterey House restaurants account for about 15% of annual revenue at the company, which also operates 258 Showbiz Pizza Place and Chuck E. Cheese restaurants.
