U.S. District Judge Kenneth L. Ryskamp ordered the U.S. Customs Service to return some 210 Cuban paintings seized last March from art collector Ramon Cernuda. 

The controversial case was the subject of a Wall Street Journal front page article in August. 

In finding for Mr. Cernuda, the judge ruled that selling or exhibiting Cuban paintings are activities protected under the First Amendment and are therefore exempt from regulation under the Trading With the Enemy Act, which bars most trade with Cuba. 

"It's a home run on all counts," said Mr. Cernuda, who alleged that he had been the subject of a prosecution motivated by conservative and politically influential segments of the Cuban exile community. 

The judge said Mr. Cernuda had been a victim of "selective enforcement" since he has been "the only art dealer subjected to government seizure of his collection." Auction houses such as Sotheby's and Christie's claim they hadn't realized that they had to acquire licenses to auction works by Cuban artists from the U.S. Treasury Department before the Cernuda controversy broke, the judge said. 

The judge found that Mr. Cernuda, who bought his paintings from the two auction houses as well as two diplomats, hadn't traded "with the enemy," as had been alleged by the government. 

U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said he hadn't seen the decision and therefore couldn't comment.
