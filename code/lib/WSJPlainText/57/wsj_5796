Amdura Corp. said Cilluffo Associates L.P. had obtained consents from enough shareholders to replace the current board and force the resignation of Robert H. Nassau as president and chief executive officer. 

The Denver hardware and automotive distributor said Cilluffo Associates had obtained support of shareholders owning approximately 51% of its shares.
New York investor Frank J.A. Cilluffo has said he started the consent solicitation because of concerns that shareholder equity would be diluted by Amdura efforts to refinance a $40 million bridge loan. 

Mr. Nassau, whose resignation is effective today, has been with Amdura since 1982. 

Meanwhile, Amdura also announced it has agreed to supply automotive aftermarket products -- such as oil, polishes and accessories -- to Sears, Roebuck & Co. and to Caldor, a division of May Department Stores Co.
The agreements, according to company officials, are expected to generate combined annual sales of approximately $20 million.
