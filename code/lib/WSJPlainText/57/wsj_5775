Apple Computer Inc. said it named Ian W. Diery, who quit recently as executive vice president of troubled Wang Laboratories Inc., president of its Apple Pacific unit. 

Mr. Diery was also named a senior vice president of the parent company.
He succeeds Delbert W. Yocam, a longtime Apple executive who has held many posts at Apple, including chief operating officer.
Mr. Yocam announced last year that he intended to leave Apple to pursue other interests. 

Mr. Diery will head up Apple's operations in the markets of Australia, Canada, Japan, the Far East and Latin America.
He begins working at Apple Oct. 16; Mr. Yocam, 45 years old, intends to stay on until Nov. 27. 

Mr. Diery, 39, resigned from Wang last month after the Lowell, Mass., concern reported a record $424.3 million net loss for the year ended June 30 and Wang President Frederick A. Wang was forced to resign by his father An Wang, the chairman and chief executive officer. 

In his 11 years at Wang, Mr. Diery rose to become the most powerful executive outside the Wang family, but he was blamed by Frederick Wang and other Wang insiders for optimistic sales forecasts that led the company to maintain its huge and costly sales and administrative staffs in the face of declining sales. 

Before his troubles at Wang, Mr. Diery, a bluff, dynamic Australian, had led Wang's highly successful European sales operations.
He was brought to the U.S. in 1986 and put in charge of U.S. sales.
His last position at Wang was executive vice president in charge of world-wide field operations.
