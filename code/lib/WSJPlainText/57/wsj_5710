Cooker Restaurant Corp. said Philip J. Hickey Jr. has been replaced as president, following his unsuccessful bid to gain control of the company. 

G. Arthur Seelbinder, chairman and chief executive officer, has assumed the additional post of president.
He said there were "differences over control of the company" and the long-term strategy. 

Officials at the restaurant concern said Mr. Hickey's resignation follows his plan to lead an outside group's buy-out of Mr. Seelbinder's 16% stake in the company. 

Mr. Seelbinder rejected the bid.
A spokesman for the company declined to comment on the price of the bid or to name those involved in the buy-out group. 

Cooker has about 10.9 million shares outstanding.
Mr. Hickey owns a 5% stake in the company, according to the spokesman.
Mr. Hickey wasn't available for comment. 

Terms of the buy-out proposal called for the resignations of Mr. Seelbinder and all other company directors, except Mr. Hickey. 

The company said it has retained J.C. Bradford & Co. as its financial adviser, but officials didn't elaborate on plans for the restaurant concern.
