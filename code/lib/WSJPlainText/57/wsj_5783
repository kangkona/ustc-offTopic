The Options Clearing Corp. named Paul Stevens, executive vice president of the American Stock Exchange, president and chief operating officer of the stock options clearinghouse. 

Mr. Stevens succeeds Fred Casey, who retired from the OCC in June.
Mr. Stevens, who was an OCC board member for nearly six years, said he "couldn't pass up" an opportunity to be the operating officer at OCC, which is jointly owned by the five U.S. exchanges that trade stock options. 

Mr. Stevens, 44, was among the architects of the American Stock Exchange's move into stock options in the mid-1970s.
Since last April, he has been in charge of equity order flow analysis at the Amex. 

Jules Winters, Amex senior vice president for market operations, is likely to be appointed to succeed Mr. Stevens next month, according to an Amex official who requested anonymity.
