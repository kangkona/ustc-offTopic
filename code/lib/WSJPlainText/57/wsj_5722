A federal judge ordered the Justice Department to investigate whether the government has leaked confidential information to the press about its case against indicted financier Michael Milken. 

But U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood said she wouldn't hold a hearing on the leak allegations made by defense lawyers until after Mr. Milken's trial, so as not to heighten publicity in the racketeering and fraud case. 

Mr. Milken's lawyers last week asked Judge Wood to order the government to halt a "constant stream" of press leaks they claimed threatened the right to a fair trial for the former head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 's junk-bond division.
Judge Wood is presiding over the case. 

"We're very pleased with the court's decision to direct an investigation into the alleged leaks," Milken attorney Martin Flumenbaum said. 

The defense motion cited stories published in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times.
