HealthVest took a giant step toward independence by terminating, effective Sept. 15, its advisory agreement with a unit of Healthcare International Inc. 

The real estate investment trust also relocated its principal office to downtown Austin, Texas, and terminated all construction management agreements with a second Healthcare subsidiary.
HealthVest has also hired several former Healthcare employees to facilitate the self-administration of the trust. 

Healthcare International is a cash-strapped health-care concern that has been selling assets to stay afloat.
HealthVest was begun with four properties leased to Healthcare and now owns more than two-dozen health-care related properties, leased to various tenants.
