Stratus Computer Inc. said third-quarter revenue and earnings would be below expectations because of weakness in the domestic market and in its sales to other computer companies that resell the Stratus systems. 

The supplier of fault-tolerant computer systems for on-line transaction processing said it expects third-quarter net income of 35 cents to 38 cents a share on revenue of about $82 million, compared with earnings of 37 cents a share on revenue of $68.9 million a year earlier. 

"We do not see enough business developing during these last two weeks of the quarter to allow us to achieve our original revenue target," said William Foster, president and chief executive officer of the company, which is based in Marlboro, Mass.
Stratus had previously projected revenue of $88 million for the quarter. "We are going to manage the company at the 20% to 25% growth level for the near term, unless we see signs of improvement in these market channels," Mr. Foster said.
