Slow sales are prompting Ford Motor Co. to place buyer incentives on its much ballyhooed Ford Super Coupe and Mercury Cougar XR-7, which were named Car of the Year by Motor Trend Magazine.
The two models share many of the same features. 

Effective last Friday, Ford offered $1,500 cash back to Super Coupe and XR-7 purchasers.
Ford hadn't previously offered incentives on those models.
A Ford spokesman confirmed that the company is adding the incentives in an attempt to boost sales of the models. 

The company also increased the cash back allowance to $750, from $500 on its Probe GL and LX models.
Ford also increased the incentive on its Probe GT model to $1,000, from $500. 

In lieu of the cash-back offerings, buyers may elect to participate in Ford's interest-rate finance program, which features discounted rates ranging from 2.9% to 10.9%, depending on terms.
