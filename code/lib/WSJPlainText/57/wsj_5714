Japan and the U.S. plan to join in developing technology to improve cars that run on methanol, a fuel that causes less air pollution than gasoline, a Japanese government official said. 

Under a four-year program starting April 1, the Industrial Science and Technology Agency will cooperate with the U.S. Environmental Protection Ageny in improving the performance of methanol cars already being tested, said Mitsuo Aikawa of the Japanese agency. 

Mr. Aikawa said the problem is to make methanol-powered cars start in cold weather or thin air. 

An unspecified number of researchers from Japanese companies will work with the EPA to develop a methanol car that will start in temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit), Mr. Aikawa said.
He said such cars currently have trouble starting at temperatures below five degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit). 

Japan plans to spend about 800 million yen ($5.5 million) for the four-year program, according to a major Japanese economic newspaper. 

President Bush has called on auto makers to help cut air pollution by producing 500,000 methanol-powered cars in 1995 and one million such cars each year from 1997 through 2004. 

Methanol is made from coal or natural gas and emits less carbon monoxide than gasoline.
Gasoline also emits nitrous oxides that contribute to smog.
