Publishers Equipment Corp., Dallas, agreed to purchase Solna Web AB, a Swedish maker of web offset printing equipment.
The acquisition is valued at approximately $16 million. 

Publishers Equipment, which makes printing presses, plans to finance the acquisition with a combination of equity and seller-financed debt.
The seller is AB Bonnierforetagen, a Swedish conglomerate that already holds approximately 22% of Publishers Equipment; the acquisition is expected to raise its stake to about 28%. 

The acquisition still must receive final approval from the Publishers Equipment board and is subject to government and third-party consents, but a Publishers Equipment spokesman said it should be completed in the fourth quarter. 

Solna Web has sales subsidiaries in England, West Germany, Brazil and the U.S. and had 1988 revenue of $60 million.
Consolidated revenue for Publishers Equipment in the same period was $46 million.
