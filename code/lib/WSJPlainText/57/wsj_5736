Students of Chilean politics just prior to the 1973 overthrow of Salvador Allende should note an exchange between Cuban Judge Julio A. Gonzalez and Cuban General Patricio de la Guardia at the general's recent drug trial.
According to the official transcript, it went like this: 

Gonzalez: De la Guardia, you held the rank of brigadier general. . . . Had you been on other internationalist missions prior to the one in Angola? 

De la Guardia: In Chile. 

Gonzalez: After that mission did you receive an award? 

De la Guardia: I received the Internationalist Medal in the first degree because I was in Chile commanding the troops when the coup d'etat in Chile occurred.
I also carried out other special tasks, other special operations.
