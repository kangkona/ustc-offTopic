Biogen Inc. said it signed a $20 million funding agreement with New York Life Insurance Co. that will expand Biogen's development and commercialization efforts for products based on the experimental AIDS drug, CD-4. 

Upon introduction into the marketplace of products based on CD-4, New York Life would earn royalties on sales world-wide.
In addition, New York Life will receive warrants for 1.8 million shares of Biogen common stock, exercisable at $17 a share between July 1992 and December 1996. 

This is New York Life's second funding agreement with a pharmaceutical company for research and development of products to treat acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
In May 1988, the insurance company reached an $8.5 million financing arrangement with IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corp., La Jolla, Calif. 

In national over-the-counter trading, common of Biogen, a Cambridge, Mass., biotechnology company, fell 37.5 cents to close at $12.125 a share.
