MAI Basic Four Inc., Tustin, Calif., said Brooke Partners L.P., which is controlled by MAI Chairman Bennett S. LeBow, completed its previously announced investment that gives Brooke a 54% stake in the computer maker. 

Brooke invested $30 million in cash, and contributed to MAI's capital $25 million of Series B preferred stock (both outstanding and to be issued).
Brooke also gave MAI certain financial guarantees, for which it received equity securities convertible into 17.5 million MAI common shares. 

MAI plans to offer shareholders nontransferable rights to buy 17.5 million MAI common shares at $3.54 each.
The rights offering is expected to be made by March 30, 1990.
MAI expects to use proceeds from the MAI stock sale in the rights offering to repurchase from Brooke a corresponding portion of equity securities it initially received. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, MAI closed yesterday at $3.125 a share, down 62.5 cents.
