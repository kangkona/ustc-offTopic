In reference to your Sept. 11 article "ROTC Regains Respect on Campuses as Graduates Fare Well in Workplace," we want to clarify an erroneous impression regarding the Villanova Naval ROTC Program for 1971-1974.
Joseph Hebert III was incorrectly identified.
He was not an instructor at Villanova but was a recruiter who traveled to many universities.
The Naval ROTC program at Villanova never held meetings at fraternity houses as we have no fraternity houses.
Villanova University and the surrounding community have supported the Navy 100% every year since World War II and the university is recognized as unequaled in providing the best of support to the Navy.
All that occurred during the Vietnam era was an occasional sign-carrying student near the parade ground in peaceful protest, but no effort was made to disrupt the Naval ROTC activities. 

Villanova and the U.S. Navy are very proud of their superb relationship over the past 50 years.
