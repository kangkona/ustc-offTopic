The state-controlled insurer Assurances Generales de France said it has obtained regulatory approval to increase its stake in the financial holding company Cie. de Navigation Mixte above 10% from the current level of about 8%. 

Friday's approval was needed to conform with Bourse rules regarding companies with bank interests and follows a similar approval given Wednesday to Cie.
Financiere de Paribas.
Both Paribas and AGF have been increasing their stakes in Navigation Mixte recently for what they have termed "investment purposes," although the issue has been surrounded by takeover speculation in recent weeks. 

AGF didn't comment officially on its reasons for seeking the approval, but people close to the group said it was done to make sure the group would have the flexibility to increase its stake in the future, should interesting price opportunities arise. 

An AGF official did specify, however, that there was no foundation to recent rumors the group might be acting in concert with Paribas.
