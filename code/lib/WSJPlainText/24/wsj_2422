Investcorp, New York, said it and the management of Sports & Recreation Inc. bought the operator of the 10-store Sports Unlimited chain for some $40 million. 

The investment bank becomes majority shareholder in Sports & Recreation, a 10-year-old sporting goods retailer, said Oliver E. Richardson, a member of Investcorp's management committee and a director of the chain. 

Sports Unlimited, Tampa, Fla., posted revenue of $59 million for the year ended July 31.
The company is "very profitable" on an operating basis, Mr. Richardson said, but he declined to specify numbers. 

In 1982, Sports & Recreation's managers and certain passive investors purchased the company from Brunswick Corp. of Skokie, Ill.
In the latest transaction, management bought out the passive investors' holding, Mr. Richardson said.
