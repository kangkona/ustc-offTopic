Giant Group Ltd. said it terminated negotiations for the purchase of Aspen Airways, a Denver-based regional carrier that operates the United Express connector service under contract to UAL Corp. 's United Airlines. 

Giant, a Beverly Hills, Calif., collection of companies that is controlled by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman, didn't give a reason for halting its plan to acquire the airline, and Aspen officials couldn't be reached for comment. 

Giant agreed last month to purchase the carrier.
Giant hasn't ever disclosed the proposed price, although Avmark Inc., an Arlington, Va.-based aircraft consulting concern, has valued Aspen's fleet at about $46 million. 

The airline would have become the latest in a peculiar blend of Giant companies, which are involved in making cement, recycling newsprint and operating fast-food restaurants.
