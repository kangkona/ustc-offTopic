"Snoozing" through the Beijing massacre?
This is the buzzword Adi Ignatius chooses to characterize in his review of my book "Tiananmen Diary: Thirteen Days in June" (Leisire & Arts, Sept. 8).
I doubt that many readers of this chronicle of the blood and bullets and terror of the Beijing massacre would put it just this way.
Nor mistake, as he seems to have done, a raw, rough-cut, unretouched, genuine diary, complete with blips, print lice and all the confusions of real time with high-gloss footnoted academic scholarship.
Such works will be forthcoming, but I doubt if they will convey the anguish of what Mr. Ignatius calls my "insta-book."
