Du Pont Co. said its Du Pont do Brasil subsidiary will invest about $19 million to build a multimillion-pound-per-year fluoropolymers plant and technical center in Sao Paulo, Brazil. 

The plant, scheduled to operate in early 1992, is part of Du Pont's plan to increase world-wide fluoropolymer capacity 40% by 1992. 

Du Pont markets fluoropolymers under the trademark Teflon.
