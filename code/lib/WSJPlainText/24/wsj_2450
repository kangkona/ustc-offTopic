Aluminum Co. of America, hit hard by the strength of the dollar overseas, said net income for the third quarter dropped 3.2% to $219 million, or $2.46 a share. 

The nation's No. 1 aluminum maker earned $226.3 million, or $2.56 a share, a year earlier. 

Revenue rose 11% to $2.83 billion from $2.56 billion. 

Analysts, who were expecting Alcoa to post around $2.70 to $3 a share, were surprised at the lackluster third-quarter results. "It's disappointing," said William Siedenburg, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. 

Much of the earnings decline was led by currency-exchange rate adjustments, which affected the bottom line by $15.3 million, or 17 cents a share, compared with $3.6 million, or four cents a share, the previous year. 

Lower prices for aluminum ingots and certain alloy products and a shift in the product mix also contributed to lower earnings, the company said. "In addition, costs were higher partly due to scheduled plant outages for modernization work," the company said. 

Excluding the higher tax rate, which rose two percentage points to 38%, and the negative exchange rate adjustment, the company would have met analysts' expectations, said R. Wayne Atwell, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Co. 

Noting that the third quarter is usually the aluminum industry's slowest, Mr. Atwell added, "the third quarter is never a bang up period for them anyway." 

Nevertheless, the company said shipments were up slightly to 679,000 metric tons from 671,000, buffing the impact of the unexpected earning decline. 

The results were announced after the stock market closed.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Alcoa closed at $72 a share, down $4.75, in a sharply lower market.
