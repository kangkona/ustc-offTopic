First Chicago Corp. posted a third-quarter loss of $23.3 million after joining other big banks in further adding to its reserves for losses on foreign loans. 

The parent company of First National Bank of Chicago, with $48 billion in assets, said it set aside $200 million to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries.
The addition, on top of two big 1987 additions to foreign-loan reserves, brings the reserve to a level equaling 79% of medium-term and long-term loans outstanding to troubled nations. 

First Chicago since 1987 has reduced its loans to such nations to $1.7 billion from $3 billion. 

Despite this loss, First Chicago said it doesn't need to sell stock to raise capital.
During the quarter, the company realized a pretax gain of $60.4 million from the sale of its First Chicago Investment Advisors unit. 

Combined foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped 24% against last year's third quarter, to $38.2 million from $50.5 million.
Gains from First Chicago's venture capital unit, a big leveraged buy-out investor, rose 32% to $34 million from $25.7 million a year ago. 

Interest income and most fee income was strong.
