Demand for products in the current quarter should weaken and inflation shouldn't put any upward pressure on prices, say U.S. plant managers in a Dun & Bradstreet Corp. survey. 

Fewer plant managers expect higher new orders and output this quarter than in the year-earlier period, according to the survey, which polls 1,500 managers of manufacturing facilities on conditions in their factories and industries. 

Plant managers' optimism "has moderated, which is in line with current economic data that indicate slow but continuing economic growth," said Joseph W. Duncan, corporate economist and chief statistician for Dun & Bradstreet, a financial-data company. 

The managers expect materials costs to drop in the quarter, leading fewer to forecast higher selling prices, Mr. Duncan said. 

Dun & Bradstreet calculates several optimism indexes, subtracting the percentage of managers expecting a decline from the percentage expecting growth. 

For overall demand, the fourth-quarter index fell to 28 from 31 last quarter and 32 in the 1988 fourth period.
For output, the index was 29, the same as last quarter, but a three-point drop from a year ago.
For new orders, the figure again was flat with the third quarter at 29.
The latest figure also is down a point from the year earlier. 

The U.S. dollar strengthened during the summer and may have damped the managers' hopes for higher demand from overseas.
Recent "declines in the dollar should bolster manufacturers' selling opportunities abroad," Mr. Duncan said. 

For the next 12 months, each of the indexes for overall demand, production and new orders fell one point from last quarter, to 57, 57 and 59, respectively.
The year-earlier figures were 60, 60 and 61. 

Dun & Bradstreet's data measuring fourth-quarter costs of making a single unit of a product indicated that "manufacturers foresee weaker prices" for materials "while wage pressures, though still present, are not expected to escalate," Mr. Duncan said.
