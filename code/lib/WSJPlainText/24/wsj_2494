Your Sept. 15 story on the destroyer DDG-51, the Arleigh Burke, inaccurately asserts, "several aluminum-hulled British ships were destroyed by Argentine missiles." 

Only one aluminum-hulled British vessel was so destroyed, the HMS Sheffield.
It was struck by an Exocet, setting off fires that ignited its aluminum superstructure.
As far as I know, there is no way to extinguish such a fire at sea, which is why the U.S. Navy has sensibly built the Burke of steel. 

However, the Navy also claims that its mostly aluminum Aegis-class cruisers, some of which are yet to be built, could never meet the fate of the Sheffield because no enemy missile could penetrate their defenses.
