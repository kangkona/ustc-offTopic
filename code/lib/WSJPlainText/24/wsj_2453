Intel Corp. reported a 50% drop in third-quarter net income, partly because of a one-time charge for discontinued operations. 

The big semiconductor and computer maker, said it had net of $72 million, or 38 cents, down 50% from $142.7 million, or 78 cents a share.
The lower net included a charge of $35 million, equal to 12 cents a share on an after-tax basis, for the cost of abandoning a computer-systems joint venture with Siemens AG of West Germany.
Earning also fell from the year-ago period because of slowing microchip demand.
Sales amounted to $771.4 million, down 1.7% from $784.9 million. 

Intel's stock rose in early over-the-counter trading Friday, as investors appeared relieved that the company's income from continuing operations was only slightly below the second quarter's earnings of $99.3 million, or 53 cents a share, and that sales actually exceeded the $747.3 million for the second period.
But Intel later succumbed to the stock market's plunge, closing at $31.75, down $2.125. 

In August, Intel warned that third-quarter earnings might be "flat to down" from the previous period's because of slowing sales growth of its 80386 microprocessor, start-up costs associated with a line of computers and costs of preparing for mass shipments of the company's new 80486 chip in the current quarter. 

On Friday, Andrew S.Grove, Intel president and chief executive officer, said "Intel's business is strong.
Our bookings improved as the quarter progressed and September was especially good.
For the full quarter, our bookings were higher than the previous quarter, and our book-to-bill ratio exceeded 1.0." 

For the nine-month period, Intel reported net of $268.3 million, or $1.43 a share, down 27% from $367.1 million, or $2.05 a share.
Revenue amounted to $2.23 billion, up slightly from $2.15 billion.
