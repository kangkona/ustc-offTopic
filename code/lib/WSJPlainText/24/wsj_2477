Cummins Engine Co. shares dropped yesterday after the company disclosed it will have to correct defects in pistons installed in some of its engines. 

In a terse release, the maker of diesel engines, parts and power systems said it has "identified a problem" with pistons used in its model K and KV diesels since May 1.
The high-horsepower motors are used in heavy applications such as construction and mining equipment. 

Cummins said the problem relates to recent modifications in the design of a piston it buys from an outside supplier.
None of the engines have failed to date, said a spokeswoman, adding that the defect doesn't represent a hazard. 

The company wouldn't identify the supplier, nor would it say how many of the defective engines it has produced.
A spokeswoman noted, however, that such engines represented only 2.5% of the company's overall production in the first six months of the year. 

The company said it will replace all pistons in the affected engines, and as a result, will "supplement K and KV warranty accruals." The spokeswoman declined to say how much money the company will have to spend on the repairs; the company recently halted production of the models until replacement pistons are available Oct. 16. 

In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Cummins shares stumbled $2 to close at $52.
The company's shares traded as high as $64 last month, before Cummins disclosed in late September that it expects to report a "substantial" third-quarter loss because of deteriorating demand and other difficulties.
