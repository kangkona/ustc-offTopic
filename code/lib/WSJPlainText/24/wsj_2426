Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co., a unit of Lockheed Corp., said it agreed to join with Aermacchi S.p.
A. of Varese, Italy, to propose a new generation of jet trainers for the U.S. Air Force. 

The Air Force is looking to buy 540 new primary jet trainers, with a total value of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, between 1994 and 2004.
The aircraft would replace the T-37, made by the Cessna Aircraft Co. unit of General Dynamics Corp., which the Air Force uses to train jet pilots.
Lockheed said the U.S. Navy may also buy an additional 340 trainer aircraft to replace its T34C trainers made by the Beech Aircraft Corp. unit of Raytheon Corp. 

Under the agreement with Lockheed, Aermacchi will license Lockheed to build the Aermacchi MB-339 jet tandem-trainer and will supply certain structures.
Lockheed will build additional structures and perform final assembly of the tandem-seat trainer at its Marietta, Ga., plant should the Air Force order the craft. 

A Lockheed spokesman in Burbank, Calif., said he wasn't aware of which other companies would be competing for the Air Force contract.
