Hammond Co., Newport Beach, Calif., said Fidelity National Financial Inc. extended its previous agreement, under which it won't purchase any more of the mortgage banker's common stock, through Oct. 31. 

The previous agreement expired Thursday. 

Hammond said that its discussions with Fidelity, an Irvine, Calif., title-insurance underwriter, are continuing, but that prospects for a longer-term standstill agreement are uncertain. 

Fidelity has increased its stake in Hammond to 23.57% in recent months.
Statements made in Securities and Exchange Commission filings led Hammond to request a standstill agreement.
