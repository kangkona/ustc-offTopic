The inflation-adjusted growth rate for France's gross domestic product for the second quarter was revised upward to 0.8% from the previous three months from the initial estimate of 0.7%, the National Statistics Institute said. 

The state agency said the latest revision left the growth rate for the first-quarter compared with the previous three months unchanged at 1.3%. 

If the economy continues to expand by 0.8% a quarter for the rest of the year, it would leave GDP growth for all of 1989 at 3%, the institute said.
That would be down from the 3.8% rise posted in 1988.
