Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said it will increase its loan-loss provisions to cover all its loans to lesser developed countries, except Mexico, resulting in an after-tax charge to 1989 earnings of 300 million Canadian dollars (US$255 million). 

Don Bowder, senior vice president and chief accountant, said the bank's strong earnings enable it to be the first major Canadian bank to set aside provisions covering all its C$1.17 billion in non-Mexican LDC debt. 

"It eliminates the continuing uncertainty with respect to the ultimate value of the loans," he said. 

The bank said about C$525 million will be added to its existing LDC and general loss provisions in its fourth quarter, ending Oct. 31.
Mr. Bowder said the C$300 million charge to earnings would amount to about C$1.34 a share.
The bank's net income for the nine months ended July 31 was C$577 million, or C$3.10 a share. 

Mr. Bowder said the bank will restructure its C$604 million of Mexican debt, of which C$255 million is in Mexican notes secured by U.S. government bonds.
The bank has a 45% reserve against the remaining C$349 million of Mexican debt and expects to swap that for other Mexican notes supported by U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds. 

Mr. Bowder said the bank's experience with LDC debt has been "painful" and this latest move represents the final phase of a program begun seven years ago to reduce its exposure through provisioning, debt sales and debt swaps.
He said the bank will no longer participate in LDC sovereign lending, but will support trade financing and other transactions that meet the bank's standards.
