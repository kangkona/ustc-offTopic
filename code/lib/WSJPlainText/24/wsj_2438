Keystone Consolidated Industries Inc. expects to report earnings before extraordinary tax benefits of about $1.5 million, or about 41 cents a share, for the third quarter, compared with a loss last year, said Glenn R. Simmons, chairman and chief executive officer. 

After a tax benefit of about $780,000, Keystone expects to report net income of $2.3 million, or about 62 cents a share, Mr. Simmons said.
For third quarter last year, Keystone reported a $1 million loss from continuing operations and a $200,000 loss from discontinued operations, for a net loss of $1.2 million. 

Revenue for the latest third quarter was about $70.5 million, up 10% from $63.6 million last year, he said. 

Mr. Simmons said the results signal a turnaround for the maker of wire and wire products, which has struggled to remain competitive in the face of lower-priced, imported steel.
A new $46 million steel rod minimill, which got off to a rocky start in early 1988, now is running efficiently and a new management team is more heavily marketing Keystone's products, Mr. Simmons said. 

As a result, the company hopes to report net income for the year of about $11.6 million, or about $3.10 to $3.15 a share, compared with a net loss of $24.4 million last year, after a loss from discontinued operations of $18.4 million.
Revenue for 1989 is expected to be about $300 million, up about 21% from $247.3 million in 1988. 

For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Keystone expects to report net income of $9.3 milion, or about $2.53 a share, after an extraordinary gain from $3.2 million in tax benefits.
Last year, the company had a net loss of $6.5 million, including a $6.1 million loss from continuing operations and a $400,000 loss from discontinued operations.
Revenue for the nine months is expected to be about $230.5 million, up about 21% from $190.4 million last year. 

Mr. Simmons said Keystone's new mill is expected to produce about 585,000 tons of steel rods this year, up from 413,000 tons in 1988.
Production at the mill has exceeded the ability of Keystone's casting operation to supply it, he said, which will force Keystone to purchase billet, or unfinished steel bars, from outside the company during the fourth quarter and next year. 

Keystone will have to consider expanding its casting operation, at an estimated cost of $8 million to $10 million, within the next 18 to 24 months, Mr. Simmons said. 

Under Robert W. Singer, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, Keystone has expanded its sales force to about 20 people from about 15 and hopes to expand its sales from the middle portion of the country toward the East and West coasts. 

"Prior to a year ago, Keystone was an order-taker.
Now I think we have a group of marketing people who are out selling to retailers and wholesalers," Mr. Simmons said. 

Still, he said, the 100-year-old company plans to continue its premium-priced strategy for its distinctive brand of red-tipped wire fencing and other products.
The company claims a 40% share of the U.S. field fence business, a 35% share of poultry netting sales and a 30% share of barbed wire sales.
