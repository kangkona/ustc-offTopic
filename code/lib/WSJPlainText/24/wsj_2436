Roger Rosenblatt, editor of U.S. News & World Report, resigned Friday from the weekly news magazine. 

Mr. Rosenblatt said he resigned because of difficulties with commuting between his home in New York and the magazine's editorial offices in Washington. "Frankly, I missed my family," said Mr. Rosenblatt. 

In Mr. Rosenblatt's tenure, the magazine's advertising pages and circulation have grown significantly.
But at 2.3 million weekly paid circulation, U.S. News still ranks third behind Time Warner Inc. 's Time magazine, with 4.4 million circulation, and Washington Post Co. 's Newsweek, with 3.3 million circulation. 

Mortimer B. Zuckerman, chairman and editor in chief, said Mr. Rosenblatt would be succeeded starting today by Michael Ruby, the magazine's executive editor, and Merrill McLoughlin, a senior writer.
Mr. Ruby and Ms. McLoughlin are married to each other.
Mr. Zuckerman said his magazine would maintain its editorial format, which is a mix of analysis and trend stories with service-oriented, how-to articles. 

Mr. Rosenblatt, a senior writer at Time magazine before joining U.S. News & World Report, said he had numerous job offers from other magazines while he was editor.
The offers were to work as a writer, not an editor.
He said he will now consider those offers.
