Suzuki Motor Co. 's U.S. sales arm has named Gary Anderson its top U.S. official in the wake of a series of resignations last month. 

Three senior executives, all Americans, quit in September.
Doug Mazza, former vice president and general manager and at the time the top American, said in a prepared statement that his and the other resignations were prompted by "changes in the company's operating goals and philosophies." 

Mr. Anderson, who joined American Suzuki Motor Corp. in June 1987, gets the title of marketing director for the company's automotive division.
He inherits "bits of several positions," said a Suzuki spokeswoman, who added that a reorganization last month has eliminated some previous posts. 

In his new job, Mr. Anderson will oversee all sales, advertising and dealer development activities in addition to formulating marketing strategies.
Some of these duties had been handled by Mr. Mazza and others by John Dorsey, former director of sales, and Larry Messelt, former national sales manager.
Messrs.
Dorsey and Messelt were the other two executives who resigned in September. 

Suzuki sales so far this year, at 24,405 cars and sport utility vehicles, are less than half the level of a year ago, despite the introduction of two additional vehicles, including Suzuki's first U.S. car.
The company hasn't recovered from claims by Consumer Reports magazine that its Samurai utility vehicle was unsafe, even though the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration refused to open a safety investigation into the allegations. 

"Suzuki recognizes its responsibility to boost dealer confidence and improve direct communication with its dealers and field personnel on its plans and strategies," said Mr. Anderson in a prepared statement. 

Mr. Anderson was most recently Suzuki's New York regional sales manager.
He also served as manager of dealer development.
