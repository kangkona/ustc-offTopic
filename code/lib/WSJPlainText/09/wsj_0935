International Business Machines Corp. made news this summer when it landed an unusual contract to manage all of Eastman Kodak Co. 's data-processing needs.
But the computer giant appears to have lost a second key contract with Kodak to archrival Digital Equipment Corp. 

Kodak yesterday confirmed that it has entered negotiations with Maynard, Mass.-based Digital to manage all of its voice and data communications needs.
Kodak, based in Rochester, N.Y., said IBM also had bid for the business.
IBM is based in Armonk, N.Y. 

The loss is a setback to IBM, which pointed to the Kodak contract as an example of its success in systems integration.
That's an emerging business in which computer makers or consultants provide turnkey communications and computing services to major corporations. 

A Kodak spokesman declined to disclose the potential value of the contract, which is still in negotiation.
He said that American Telephone & Telegraph, MCI Communications Corp., Rochester Telephone Corp. and IBM itself would likely be Digital's subcontractors on the project. 

"When we decided to look outside the company for critical data-processing and communications services, we wanted to get the best vendor for that service," said Paul Allen, the spokesman. "That's why we went with IBM for data center management . . . and now Digital for voice and data telecommunications."
