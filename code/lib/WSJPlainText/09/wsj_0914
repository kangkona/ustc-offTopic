ALAMCO Inc. said its board has approved a 1-for-10 reverse stock split.
The Clarksburg, W.Va., producer of gas and oil, said it wants shareholders to approve the split because it would "enhance the marketability" and trading of the stock.
If approved at a shareholder meeting in December, the number of shares outstanding would decrease to five million from 50 million, and par value would rise to 10 cents from a penny.
