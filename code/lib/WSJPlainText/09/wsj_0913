The average unemployment rate in the 15 biggest industrialized democracies was steady in August at the 6.1% rate of the two previous months, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said. 

The August rate was 0.6 percentage point lower than in the like month a year earlier, reflecting the pickup of activity in the 15 countries. 

The OECD said that most of the improvement occurred in the second half of last year; since February of this year, unemployment has been steady at around 6.2% of the labor force.
