A merchant bank and investment fund have agreed to co-sponsor a reorganization plan to bring Sharon Steel Corp. out of Chapter 11 proceedings and to acquire the company's steel-related assets in a transaction valued at more than $300 million. 

Castle Harlan Inc., a New York merchant bank, and Quantum Fund said they would acquire the assets for a combination of cash and the assumption of certain of Sharon's liabilities.
The balance of the company's assets and liabilities would be transferred to a new company that would be owned by Sharon's creditors.
Quantum said it has agreed to purchase as much as $50 million in equity in the new company, if necessary, for the confirmation of the plan. 

Castle Harlan and Quantum said the plan is expected to be filed within 60 days with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Pittsburgh.
The agreement is subject to certain conditions, including obtaining financing.
Castle Harlan said that such financing is already being sought and that a formal proposal would be made to Sharon's Chapter 11 trustee and other Sharon creditors over the next few days. 

Sharon, based in Farrell, Pa., filed for protection from creditors under the federal Bankruptcy Code in April 1987.
The company had been one of the maninstays of Miami Beach financier Victor Posner's empire.
Mr. Posner resigned as president and chief executive officer of Sharon in April 1988.
He remains chairman, but wields little power at the company. 

Quantum Fund, based in New York, is a $2.1 billion investment fund managed by Soros Fund Management.
Quantum is Sharon's largest unsecured creditor.
The Castle Harlan group includes Walter Sieckman, former chief operating officer of Sharon, and Wolfgang Jansen, former executive vice president. 

Executives at Sharon declined to comment on the proposal.
The company's trustee, F.E. Agnew, was unavailable for comment.
