Canadian manufacturers recorded a 0.8% decline in August in their backlog of unfilled orders, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said. 

The August drop was the fourth decline in five months.
Most of the August decrease was attributed to lower order backlogs in the primary metal and electric and electronics-product industries. 

Manufacturers' shipments rose 0.3% in August following two months of declines.
Inventories fell 0.3% in August.
