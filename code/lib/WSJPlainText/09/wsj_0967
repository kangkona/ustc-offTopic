Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc., a unit of Daimler-Benz AG, paid Massachusetts $9.1 million in taxes, bringing to an end a 10-month-long corporate tax chase. 

Officials at the Department of Revenue had dogged the foreign car maker for taxes owed on business transactions and were proceeding to settle the dispute in court.
But "the check arrived in the mail," said Stephen Kidder, Massachusetts Commissioner of Revenue. 

Mercedes-Benz, which had said it didn't owe taxes to Massachusetts partly because it sells its cars at a dock in Baltimore and not in Massachusetts, didn't explain its change of heart. 

Last month, Mercedes-Benz executives approached state revenue officials complaining about bad press, the commissioner said.
The dispute was the subject of a Wall Street Journal article in August. 

The amount covers taxes, interest and penalties owed from 1966, when the state began collecting corporate taxes, to 1985.
Mercedes-Benz also agreed to pay taxes owed for the years 1986 through 1988, Mr. Kidder added. 

Under Massachusetts tax laws, corporations must pay 9.5% of estimated profits resulting from business transactions in the state if the company conducts a variety of non-sales activities, including warranties, customer complaints and relations with independent dealerships.
