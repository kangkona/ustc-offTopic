The Sept. 25 "Tracking Travel" column advises readers to "Charge With Caution When Traveling Abroad" because credit-card companies charge 1% to convert foreign-currency expenditures into dollars.
In fact, this is the best bargain available to someone traveling abroad. 

In contrast to the 1% conversion fee charged by Visa, foreign-currency dealers routinely charge 7% or more to convert U.S. dollars into foreign currency.
On top of this, the traveler who converts his dollars into foreign currency before the trip starts will lose interest from the day of conversion.
At the end of the trip, any unspent foreign exchange will have to be converted back into dollars, with another commission due. 

The card holder will pay the modest 1% fee only on the amounts actually needed.
Typically, he will be billed only several weeks after the expenditure, and then has another couple of weeks before he has to pay the bill.
In the meantime, the money can continue to earn interest for the card holder -- often more than 1% during that "float" period alone.
