Adolph Coors Co. said its Coors Brewing Co. unit will test market a new line of bottled water in the West beginning early next year. 

The move, which was expected, marks the first time since Prohibition that Coors has sold a non-alcoholic beverage, and marks the company's entry into a crowded, but fast-growing market that generated about $2.2 billion in sales last year. 

Coors is hoping to become one of the first companies to distribute bottled water nationwide.
Perrier, sold by Perrier Group of America, a unit of Source Perrier S.A. of Paris, and Evian, sold by a U.S. unit BSN of France, are distributed to urban areas nationally, but are less available in rural communities.
Coors, with its large beer-distribution network, could penetrate more markets. 

The company said the water will be called Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water and will come from the same mountain spring as water used in Coors beer.
The company said it will sell the water plain and with lemon-lime and cherry flavors and will package it in 28-ounce bottles and 6.5 ounce bottles as part of six-packs. 

The test markets, though not specified, will be in northern California, Arizona and Colorado, some of the hottest bottled-water markets.
