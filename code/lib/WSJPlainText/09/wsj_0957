Regarding your Sept. 28 Politics & Policy column on the party differences over cutting capital gains or expanding IRAs: Why not compromise now and save the public from the coming infantile congressional political rhetoric that seems to go hand in hand with the process? 

The Republicans maintain that a 30% capital-gains exclusion will raise revenue in the short term and spur economic investment, while the Democrats maintain that an increase in the top income-tax rate and expanded IRAs will raise revenue and spur savings. 

This is a classic example of the old saying, "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts." It's ridiculous for a family with taxable income of $50,000 to pay the same 28% incremental tax rate as a family with taxable income of $250,000.
The 33% bracket should apply to all income over the applicable level, not just the 5% rate adjustment amount.
It's equally ridiculous not to provide a capital investment or retirement-savings tax incentive.
