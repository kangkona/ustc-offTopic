The amount of blood surgical patients can donate and store before surgery can be increased by the new genetically engineered drug, EPO. 

EPO, or erythropoietin, is a protein the human body makes to stimulate the growth of red blood cells.
A genetically engineered version of the human protein developed by Amgen Corp. of Thousand Oaks, Calif., recently has been marketed by the Ortho Pharmaceuticals division of Johnson & Johnson.
A competing version of EPO is being developed by Genetics Institute Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.
The drug is being used primarily to treat anemias. 

A new experiment, reported in this week's New England Journal of Medicine, involved giving injections of Amgen's EPO to 23 patients who wanted to store units of their own blood. 

The patients began receiving EPO injections about a month before their scheduled surgery.
They then began donating blood twice a week, receiving an EPO injection each time.
If tests indicated a low number of red cells, blood wasn't taken. 

The EPO-treated patients donated an average of 5.4 units of blood each compared with only 4.1 units donated by a similar group of surgical patients who received a placebo injection.
The volume of red cells donated by the EPO-treated patients was 41% higher per donor, the research team representing a number of hospitals and blood banks reported.
