Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole named a mediator to help resolve the lengthy labor dispute between the United Mine Workers and Pittston Co. 

W.J. Usery Jr., labor secretary during the Ford administration, was named to mediate talks to settle the six-month strike by the UMW. 

Previous talks between Pittston, of Greenwich, Conn., and the union have been sporadic and unsuccessful. 

The union called the strike in April after Pittston refused to sign the UMW's national labor pact.
Pittston seeks changes in health and pension benefits, among other things.
No schedule for formal talks was set, but meetings are expected to begin soon.
