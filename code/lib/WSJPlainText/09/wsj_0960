The recent bids for United and American Airlines have led Congress to move with supersonic speed to protect incumbent airline managements.
The House is scheduled to vote today on an anti-airline-takeover bill that would block, for up to 50 days, any bid for 15% or more of a U.S. airline, even a straight cash purchase.
Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner, who earlier fueled the anti-takeover fires with his quasi-xenophobic attacks on foreign investment in U.S. carriers, now says the bill would further disturb the jittery capital markets.
Texas Rep. Steve Bartlett, who has 40,000 American Airlines workers in his district, says the bill is "good politics, but bad law." It is ironic that at a time when America's partial airline deregulation is being emulated by governments from New Zealand to Ethiopia, so many in Congress favor an incumbent-protection program for airlines that would be more appropriate for the Soviet airline, Aeroflot.
