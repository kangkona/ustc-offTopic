Parker Hannifin Corp. said it agreed to sell its three automotive parts divisions to a management-led investor group for $80 million. 

The buy-out group is headed by Paul R. Lederer, president of Parker's automotive group, and includes several other executives of the three divisions. 

The units are the Edelmann, Ideal and Plews divisions.
Net sales for the units for the fiscal year ended June 30 were $135.6 million. 

Parker officials said the company is selling the units to focus on its other businesses.
