Furukawa Electric Co. said it plans to increase production of computer memory devices on a large scale in the U.S. and Japan. 

As part of the move, its affiliated U.S. company, International Components Technology Corp., purchased a Mexican plant formerly belonging to KSI Disc Products Inc.
The price wasn't disclosed. 

Together with two existing plants in the U.S., Furukawa said it will expand its current local monthly production of memory disks to 1.4 million sheets from 800,000.
In Japan, Furukawa said it will raise production at a plant outside Tokyo to 300,000 sheets monthly from 100,000. 

Furukawa said the U.S. market is strengthening as related computer technology gains in sophistication and quality.
