Bell Atlantic Corp. said it agreed definitively to acquire one of Control Data Corp. 's computer-maintenance businesses.
Terms of the accord weren't disclosed. 

Control Data's third-party maintenance unit services products primarily made by Digital Equipment Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.
The unit has 6,000 customers and, according to one analyst, had 1988 revenue of about $85 million. 

Under the agreement, which had been widely expected, Bell Atlantic would be buying Control Data's customer base and its approximately 100 U.S. maintenance facilities in about 33 cities.
However, Control Data would continue to provide maintenance services for customers of its Cyber product line. 

The unit represents a small portion of Minneapolis-based Control Data's overall computer-servicing business, which last year posted sales of about $400 million.
Earlier this year, the company sold a similar unit in Europe for about $25 million. 

Lawrence Perlman, Control Data's president and chief operating officer, said the maintenance business no longer fits into the company's "strategy to be a data solutions company." 

Thomas Vassiliades, president of Bell Atlantic's customer services division, said the acquisition would give the company's Sorbus computer-maintenance unit added expertise in "the increasingly sophisticated workstation and high-end mainframe technologies."
