Clayton & Dubilier Inc. said it will acquire Wickes Cos. 's APS Inc. auto-parts business for $200 million. 

Just two weeks ago the closely held leveraged-buy-out fund agreed to sell its Uniroyal-Goodrich Tire Co. to Michelin Group for $690 million plus $810 million in Uniroyal debt to be assumed by the buyer.
And Japan's big Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank recently agreed to invest as much as $100 million into a Clayton & Dubilier buy-out fund. 

Martin H. Dubilier, chairman and chief executive officer, said he values the new subsidiary and its Big A line of auto parts because of its wide distribution network.
APS includes 109 company-owned stores, 30 warehouses across the country that enable APS to deliver parts within 24 hours, plus 1,400 franchises that cover most regions of the U.S. Mr. Dubilier predicted he can add 750 more Big A distributors within five years. 

The APS acquisition, subject to financing, is likely to allow Clayton & Dubilier to continue its approach to leveraged buyouts.
The firm typically doesn't break up a newly acquired company, but instead improves operations and later sells it at a sizable profit.
Of 15 acquisitions made since 1978, Clayton & Dubilier still owns nine of the companies.
The others were sold at gains that average a 102% annual return over the past two years.
The recent Uniroyal-Goodrich Tire pact afforded a return even higher than that, Mr. Dubilier said. 

Wickes is a Santa Monica, Calif., retail concern.
