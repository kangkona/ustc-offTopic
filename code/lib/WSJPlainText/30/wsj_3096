United Parcel Service said it will begin providing express package-delivery service to major cities in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. 

In mid-November, closely held UPS, the world's largest package-delivery company, will reach East Berlin, Budapest, Moscow, Leningrad, Warsaw and Krakow.
To facilitate the service, UPS formed joint ventures with a Soviet company, Sovtransavto, and the Polish Airports Authority.
UPS, which has $11 billion in annual revenue, also formed a unit in Hungary.
