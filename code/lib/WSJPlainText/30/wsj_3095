No Greener Pastures 

In one aspect of my growing up 

Very little change did result: 

In the sandbox all day as a kid, 

And in the sand trap as an adult. 

-- Arnold J. Zarett. 

Candid Comment 

Some of those swanky restaurants are so expensive you need an after-dinner mint to pay the check. 

-- Sam Ewing.
