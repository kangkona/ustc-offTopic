Dow Jones & Co. said third-quarter net income fell 9.9% from the year-earlier period, which included a one-time gain. 

Net fell to $28.8 million, or 29 cents a share, from $32 million, or 33 cents a share.
The 1988 period included a one-time gain of $3.5 million, or four cents a share, from the sale of investments.
Operating income was flat at $71.5 million.
Revenue gained 5.3% to $404.1 million from $383.8 million. 

The results reflect continued softness in financial advertising at The Wall Street Journal and Barron's magazine, as well as an 18% decline in profit at Telerate Inc., which is 67%-owned by Dow Jones.
Dow Jones has made a tender offer for the rest of Telerate at $18 a share. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Dow Jones rose 25 cents to $38.125, while Telerate dropped 12.5 cents to $20.25. 

Dow Jones said operating income at its business publications segment rose 1% to $13.4 million.
Advertising linage at The Wall Street Journal fell 6.1% in the third quarter, or 4.6% an issue; there was one fewer issue published in the latest quarter.
In the nine months, Journal ad linage dropped 7.9% overall and 7.4% an issue.
Barron's magazine advertising linage declined 9.4% in the third quarter and 17% in the nine months.
Third-quarter revenue was about flat at $170 million. 

The information services segment, which includes Telerate's results, posted an operating income gain of 4.4% in the third quarter as revenue rose 13% to $175.3 million. 

Excluding Telerate, the Dow Jones Information Services Group reported a 6.8% increase in operating income as revenue increased 10%. 

Ottaway Newspapers Inc., the company's community newspapers segment, saw operating income fall 13% to $8.6 million, as ad linage at Ottaway's 23 daily newspapers fell 3.4%.
Revenue gained 1.5% to $58.7 million.
In the nine months, Dow Jones had net of $277.2 million, or $2.75 a share, up 50% from $185.1 million, or $1.92 a share.
The latest period included an after-tax gain of $164.1 million, or $1.63 a share, from the January sale of Dow Jones's holdings in Continental Cablevision Inc.; the 1988 period included an after-tax gain of $68 million, or 71 cents a share, largely from the sale of a book-publishing subsidiary.
Without the gains, net would have fallen 3.5%. 

Revenue in the nine months increased 4.9% to $1.25 billion from $1.19 billion. 

At Telerate, net income fell 18% to $19.5 million, or 21 cents a share, from $23.6 million, or 25 cents a share.
Dow Jones consolidates all of Telerate's revenue, operating expenses and operating income with its own.
Operating income at Telerate gained 5.1% to $40.8 million from $38.8 million.
Revenue rose to $127.8 million, a 14% gain from $112.3 million. 

Neil S. Hirsch, president and chief executive officer of Telerate, said earnings were hurt by costs associated with the introduction of the Trading Service, a foreign-exchange electronic-transaction service venture with American Telephone & Telegraph Co. Mr. Hirsch said these costs will continue to affect results in the fourth quarter.
He said Telerate continues to have growth in subscriptions to its services. 

Separately, Telerate said it is in negotiations with AT&T for the purchase of AT&T's 50% of Global Transactions Services Co.
The venture runs the Trading Service.
