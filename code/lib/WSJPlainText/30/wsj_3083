(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

CLARK GABLE, THE ADMAN HERO of the 1947 movie "The Hucksters," traveled to Los Angeles on the hot-ticket 20th Century Limited, connecting with the Super Chief out of Chicago.
If Gable tried that today, he would never get out of New York: The Century made its last run in the Sixties. 

By the time Congress created the National Railroad Passenger Corp. in 1970, railroads were carrying only 4% of intercity travel and losing $200 million a year on it.
Amtrak, as the new system was called, took over in May 1971 with Roger Lewis, ex-president of General Dynamics, as chief executive, and a grab-bag of second-hand rolling stock. 

Before the year was out, Lewis sidetracked half his passenger trains, bought 1,200 rail cars from nine railroads and returned to Capitol Hill for $170 million to meet operating costs.
The original $330 million assigned to Amtrak had gone for marketing, including $6 million for spiffy new uniforms. 

Amtrak looked more like a real railroad in 1973 when it began replacing its hand-me-down equipment.
Today, the fleet includes almost 300 locomotives and 1,700 passenger cars, all new or completely rebuilt. 

So far Amtrak is meeting two of its mandates -- providing and promoting an intercity passenger service.
It serves 500 cities (compared with about 330 for airlines), and last year's revenue topped $1.1 billion.
Intercity riders totaled 21.5 million, and 220 daily trains each averaged 189 paying passengers. 

As for Congress's third request -- to make a profit -- Amtrak is still trying.
In fiscal 1988, it paid 69% of its costs out of revenue, compared with 48% in 1981, according to W. Graham Claytor, the former Southern Railway CEO who is now Amtrak's chairman. "We are not aware," he told Congress this year, "of any passenger railroad in the world that covers more of its own costs."
