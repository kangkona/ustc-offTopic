Good news for the American family: An opinion poll concludes that Americans still believe a family is a good thing.
It sometimes seems that nothing in American life truly exists until a poll confirms its existence, and we're encouraged by the pollsters' thoughts on politicians.
Addressing the subject of politics and the family, Dr. Lee Salk, who helped Massachusetts Mutual Insurance review the poll, says, "It tells us that our legislators really don't know what they're doing." It turns out, though, that some parents don't think other parents know what they're doing either, blaming many family problems they see on a failure "to discipline their children." Considering the rapid rate of change all around today, it's reassuring to see one poll that is reconfirming the verities of human history.
