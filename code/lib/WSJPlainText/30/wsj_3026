Vincent van Gogh's "Irises," the most expensive painting in history, is still in the "control" of the auction house that sold it nearly two years ago. 

Sotheby's Holdings Inc. said the painting has been "put away in a secure location" while it waits for Australian businessman Alan Bond to pay the remainder of the $53.9 million purchase price. 

The auction house lent Mr. Bond approximately half the money needed to buy the painting, said Mitchell Zuckerman, president of Sotheby's Financial Services arm, and that loan has not been fully repaid. "Since the painting constitutes collateral of the loan, the location is in our control," he said. 

The record price of "Irises" has been the landmark and most visible achievement of the decade's raging and seemingly unstoppable bull market in art.
But within a year after the purchase, rumors began to circulate in the art world that the purchase was jeopardized by financial problems in Mr. Bond's media, brewing and real-estate empire. 

But Mr. Zuckerman denied a report that Sotheby's has foreclosed on the van Gogh and is attempting to sell it.
Sotheby's declined to provide terms of the loan or to comment on whether payments have been timely.
Mr. Bond couldn't be reached for comment. 

"Mr.
Bond remains the owner" of "Irises," Mr. Zuckerman said.
He added that in order to raise cash, "Mr.
Bond has elected to sell" another painting, a Manet, at Sotheby's Nov. 15 auction of impressionist and modern paintings. 

"The proceeds will be used to pay off the loan," he said.
Sotheby's estimates that the Manet painting, "La Promenade," will fetch $10 million to $14 million. 

The former owner of "Irises," collector and art dealer John Payson, said he has been paid in full, in three installments spread out over 1986 and 1987. "It's a tempest in a teapot," he said of the controversy over the painting.
