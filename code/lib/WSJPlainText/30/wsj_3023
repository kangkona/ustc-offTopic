As part of an ongoing restructuring program, USX Corp. said it sold its equity interests in three South African companies that produce raw materials that no longer were essential to its operations. 

A USX spokesman declined to say how much the company received or whether the steel and energy concern expected to report a gain from the sales.
The buyers weren't identified. 

USX doesn't have any South African operations or employees. 

In the company's 1988 10-K report, USX said it owned 46% of Prieska Copper Mines Ltd., 45% of Feralloys Ltd. and 21% of Associated Manganese Mines of South Africa Ltd. USX said its USX Holdings Inc. unit had held non-controlling interests in those companies since 1968.
