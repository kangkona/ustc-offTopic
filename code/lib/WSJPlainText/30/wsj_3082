STARS AND STRIPES: The armed services newspaper Stars and Stripes in the future will be run by civilians instead of military officers, the Pentagon said.
The change will be made when the current military editors retire.
The GAO last year found evidence of censorship and improper management at the government-run daily and said the editor-in-chief should be a civilian with solid journalism credentials.
