London shares fell sharply in reaction to weakness in the pound and fears that last week's rise in U.K. banks' base lending rates could bring on a recession instead of boosting sterling as intended. 

Tokyo stock prices rebounded as the market was pushed up by gains among higher-priced issues.
Prices were generally higher elsewhere in Asia and mixed in Europe.
The Hong Kong, Seoul and South African markets were closed for holidays. 

London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 30.5 points to 2247.0, its lowest close since July 10.
The Financial Times 30-share index tumbled 34.9 to 1822.9.
Volume slowed to 424 million shares from Friday's 505.5 million. 

Dealers pointed to the pound's fall below 3.00 marks, a level traders have long considered the lowest the government would allow, as the key factor in the market's decline.
The pound was quoted in late London trading at 2.9788 marks. 

The currency's weakness helped amplify market concerns over rising interest rates and a possible recession.
Analysts fear that a continued slide in the pound, along with the current high interest rates, could put Britain back in its high-inflation, low-growth predicament of the 1970s. 

Moreover, economists said yesterday that last week's one-point rise in base lending rates to 15%, which followed rate increases by the West German Bundesbank, might have to be followed by still another increase.
That would be the 12th rate rise in the British government's 16-month campaign to wring inflation out of the economy. 

But even with the stock market's sharp declines, dealers pointed to the thin volume and said the fall was largely driven by profit-taking rather than by a big selling wave.
They also said institutions were actively buying what they considered some of the more recession-proof blue-chip issues. 

Actual or rumored takeover targets were among the day's biggest losers.
Jaguar, the most active issue, fell 46 pence to 685 pence ($11) a share on a flurry of profit-taking after being driven sharply higher last week on bid speculation. 

Dealers said many market players expected the luxury auto maker to sign a cooperation accord with General Motors to prevent a hostile bid by Ford Motor or any other auto maker.
Turnover in Jaguar totaled 10 million shares.
After the close of trading, Jaguar announced it was in talks with General Motors over joint operations in certain areas. 

Among the blue-chip leaders were oil stocks, which dealers said are viewed as sheltered from the pound's weakness. 

Shell Transport & Trading gained 5 to 441.5, British Petroleum rose 0.5 to 302, Enterprise Oil gained 2 to 590, Lasmo eased 1 to 502, and Burmah surged 18 to 619. 

Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch health products and food manufacturer, gained 9 to 649.
Dealers said its strong offshore earnings made it a leading choice among investors seeking defensive issues. 

Building stocks were battered by last week's jump in interest rates.
RMC fell 24 to 645, Tarmac lost 8 to 255, Redland dropped 16 to 514, and BPB declined 5 to 233. 

Eurotunnel, which said it now expects to generate more revenue in the long term than previously projected, closed at 568, down 40.
The Anglo-French consortium recently said it will need more cash to complete the English Channel tunnel project. 

Imperial Chemical Industries, which said it sold its U.S. over-the-counter drug business for $450 million and acquired an anti-depressant drug business from Merck, fell 22 to #11.75. 

British Airways was down 5.5 to 205 in relatively brisk trading.
But dealers said it was getting support from general interest in the airline sector after U.S. investor Donald Trump's bid last week for American Airlines. 

Tokyo's 225-stock Nikkei Index, which fell 313.64 Friday, rose 167.00 to close at 35376.35.
Volume on the first section was estimated at 700 million shares, compared with 737 million Friday.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 549-411, with 173 unchanged.
The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the first section, which fell 17.61 points Friday, was up 14.18, or 0.53%, at 2673.56. 

Traders said the market had absorbed the impact of last week's increases in interest rates in Europe.
That increase, led by the West German Bundesbank Thursday, sparked a sharp fall in Japanese share prices Friday. 

However, a persistent upturn by the dollar in afternoon Tokyo dealing yesterday discouraged institutions from active trading, dealers said.
This left the market largely to corporations and individual investors, who also tended to avoid making any major moves. 

Traders said market participants will be watching to see whether the dollar climbs further in New York today, when financial markets in Japan are closed for a holiday. 

Institutions also remained on the sidelines ahead of U.S. wholesale price data due to be released Friday that could affect U.S. monetary policy, traders said. 

Traders said yesterday's session was dominated by rapid rotational buying aimed at capturing quick profits.
High-priced issues surged, but traders said the advances weren't sustained, as many buyers sought to dump the shares quickly. 

The leader in the high-priced sector was Sony, which rose 770 to a record 9,380 yen ($65.90) a share. 

Others included TDK, which surged 710 to 6,620, Secom, up 300 to 8,750, and Seven-Eleven, which gained 150 to 9,550.
Pioneer Electronic, which rose steadily last week, advanced only 10 to 6,170. 

Machinery issues attracted investors because of growing capital investment by industries, traders said.
Toyoda Machine Works was up 90 at 1,880, Komori Printing Machineries gained 220 to 6,000, CDK added 90 to 1,690, and Fanuc was up 110 to 8,130.
Toyota Motor, which traders said attracted buyers because strong sales of its larger cars, was up 170 to 2,610. 

In other Asian and Pacific markets, shares closed higher in Taipei and Manila, lower in Singapore, Wellington and little changed in Sydney. 

Elsewhere, stock prices rose in Frankfurt, Paris, Brussels, Zurich and Milan and were mixed in Amsterdam and Stockholm.
