Control Data Corp. is believed seeking a buyer for an operation that services rival makers' computer equipment in the U.S. 

Wall Street and computer industry sources said the Minneapolis company has indicated privately it hopes to sell the business before year end.
Control Data wouldn't comment.
Earlier this year it sold a similar unit operating in Europe for an estimated $25 million. 

One analyst, who said the U.S. operation recorded about $85 million in revenue last year, estimated the domestic operation could fetch between $40 million and $70 million. 

Among those believed interested in the business is the Sorbus computer-servicing unit of Bell Atlantic Corp. 

Bell Atlantic declined to comment.
In the past, Raymond W. Smith, Bell Atlantic's chairman and chief executive officer, has said the company would like to increase Sorbus operations by acquiring other businesses or expanding its customer base.
However, last month, Bell Atlantic announced that it might be writing down the inventory of Sorbus, leading some analysts to speculate that the company won't be expanding its computer maintenance division. 

Third-party maintenance is a small portion of Control Data's overall computer servicing business, which last year posted sales of about $400 million.
