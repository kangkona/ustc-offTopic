John Werner Kluge, founder of Metromedia Inc., jumped to No. 1 on Forbes magazine's list of the richest Americans. 

Mr. Kluge, who Forbes said has a net worth of more than $5.2 billion, succeeds Sam Walton, the former chief executive officer of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
The list is in the Oct. 23 issue. 

Mr. Walton dropped to 20th, because he split his fortune among himself and his four children and quit as chief executive of Wal-Mart, which operates more than 1,300 stores.
Mr. Walton has a net worth of $1.8 billion, as currently do each of his children. 

An owner of cellular-telephone franchises, Mr. Kluge added about $2 billion to his net worth from a recent agreement to sell Metromedia's New York City franchise to McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. 

Warren Buffett, head of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. investment company, jumped from 12th place to second.
Sumner M. Redstone, chief executive of National Amusements and Viacom International Inc. leapt 19 spots to third. 

New York was the home state of 80 of those named on the list, 25% more than any other state.
