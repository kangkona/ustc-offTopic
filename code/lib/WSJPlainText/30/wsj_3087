(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

ROY JACUZZI DISPLAYED HIS WHIRLPOOL bath in June 1968 at the Orange County, Calif., fair, and bathrooms were never the same. 

His design was a descendant of a 1956 device that had been created by Jacuzzi Brothers to give Roy's cousin hydrotherapy treatment for arthritis.
That early model was like a small portable outboard boat engine that fit on the side of the tub and stirred the bathwater.
It was a new product for a farm pump company founded in 1915 by Roy's grandfather and six great-uncles who had come from Italy. 

Roy's later system had built-in nozzles that sent jets of a tingling air-water mixture under pressure into the tub.
Roy hawked this $700 "Roman Bath" model at home shows. 

The special baths became larger and fancier over the years as majors like American Standard, Eljer and Kohler entered the competition.
In 1970, Jacuzzi's model was ample for two adults at a time.
That same year it offered a spa system with a filter so the same water could be reused. 

Roy had a big coup in 1974 with a sale to President Ford in the White House.
Their use spread from the laid-back, mellow California set to the status-conscious, mostly affluent across the U.S. Health clubs took to them. 

Jacuzzi since 1987 has been owned by Hanson PLC, a British concern that has kept Roy, the last of more than 100Jacuzzis who once worked for the company, as president.
Among the many Jacuzzis is a top-of-the-line $6,000 model that will soothe six people at a time with whipped up water, underwater lights and makeup vanities. 

About 60 U.S. whirlpool makers this year will turn out some 215,000 units, up from 1988's record 202,591, according to Patrick Higgins, a plumbing industry consultant.
Jacuzzi remains a leader.
