Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it cut its rating of Lockheed Corp. 's senior debt to single-A-3 from single-A-2 and the company's shelf registration to prospective single-A-3 from prospective single-A-2. 

In making the downgrades, which affect $1 billion of debt, Moody's cited a tougher business environment for defense contractors and Lockheed's "reduced earnings potential" for several of its fixed-price contracts. 

Last week, Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered its ratings on Lockheed's senior debt and shelf registration, citing similar reasons. 

In Calabasas, Calif., Lockheed officials declined to comment.
Last week, the company said it expected to post a third-quarter net loss of $35 million, reflecting $165 million in charges on several fixed-price contracts.
