Southern Co. said its Georgia Power Co. unit, which asked for a $413 million rate boost, was granted a $218 million increase, which will be phased in. 

It said Georgia Power sought the increase to recover its investment in Unit 2 of its Vogtle Nuclear Power plant and other costs of providing service. 

The Atlanta company said it will receive $75 million of the increase during the first year, which began last Tuesday, and the remainder -- some $143 million -- over the next 10 years. 

The company said it is considering whether to ask the Georgia Public Service Commission to reconsider its decision.
