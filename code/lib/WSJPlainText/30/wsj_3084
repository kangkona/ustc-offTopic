(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

THE 1970 STOCK MARKET COLLAPSE awakened new echoes of the Great Crash 40 years before.
The parallels were there.
The Dow Jones Industrials fell from 810 to the 600s -- and again the slide had followed an orgy of speculation, the "go-go" market of the 60s.
In 1929, Wall Street's wise men said the Federal Reserve would save the market.
In 1970, the Fed and the SEC were cited as safeguards.
As in 1929, the economy was showing serious weaknesses.
High interest rates, for example, had stifled housing and discouraged business spending. 

Differences were just as obvious.
Perhaps five million investors were caught in 1929, when $30 billion in paper vanished.
In mid-1970, stockbrokers numbered 31 million and losses added up to $300 billion.
In 1929, the Dow told the story, because the market was in its blue chips.
In 1970, the heaviest losses were in the go-go high flyers. 

White House intervention figured in both Years.
Herbert Hoover spoke out after 1929's Black Thursday to say that business was "on a sound and prosperous basis." In April 1970, Richard Nixon said that if he had spare cash, we would buy stock.
Neither had any effect. 

In May, Bernard Lasker, president of the New York Stock Exchange, called on his old friend Nixon to convene a meeting of government and business leaders.
That helped.
News of the powpow -- which produced nothing of note -- sent the Dow up more than 32 points. 

That euphoric leap came too late for H. Ross Perot, the Texas data-processing wizard.
On April 22, his stock holdings had dropped more than 50 points, costing him $450 million.
Perot was unperturbed -- he was still worth more than $1 billion -- and on a smaller scale that was the stock-market story.
The Federal Reserve's rule calling for margins of 80% meant that most investors were using cash, not credit.
The 1970 crash, unlike 1929, left most investors badly bent, but not broke.
