Hyundai Motor America said it is voluntarily recalling about 28,450 of its 1986 Excels sold in California for a possible problem involving exhaust emissions. 

The U.S. sales and marketing arm of the South Korean auto maker Hyundai Motor Co. said the 1986-model Excels will likely fail the emissions test of the state of California if a number of possible flaws in the exhaust system aren't serviced. 

Hyundai said it will ask owners to return cars to dealers for free servicing.
It will also ask previous owners of the cars to notify current owners of the recall.
