A.O. Smith Corp., citing the effects of a lengthy strike and an unfavorable judgment in a court case in addition to softening markets, said it expects to report a third-quarter loss between $9 million and $10 million. 

In the year-ago period, the company had net income of $997,000, or one cent a primary share after payment of preferred dividends, on sales of $236.6 million. 

The maker of automotive equipment and other systems said a recently settled 53-day strike at a major plant in Kentucky hurt earnings, as did a $5.8 million judgment against a former subsidiary.
Smith had appealed unfavorable rulings on the litigation, which dates back to 1983, all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, but its petition for a High Court review was recently rejected.
An official said the company hadn't taken any reserve to cover the litigation. 

In addition to those "one-time events," Smith said, earnings were pressured by "sharply lower orders for automotive, light truck and heavy truck structural products" in the third quarter; the company said that with inventories of passenger cars and light trucks remaining at high levels, it anticipates lower volumes to continue into the fourth period. "It's difficult at this point to be optimistic about the balance of 1989," said Robert J. O'Toole, president and chief executive officer. 

For the six months, ended June 30, Smith had net income of $13.2 million, or $1.42 a share, on sales of $542.6. million.
