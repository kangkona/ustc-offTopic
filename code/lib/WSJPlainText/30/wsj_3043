Borland International Inc. said sales and earnings for its second quarter ended Sept. 30 will exceed most analysts' expectations.
It also said it completed a 5-for-1 reverse stock split in preparation for its first U.S. public offering. 

The personal-computer software producer said results exceeded the first quarters's net income of $1.6 million, on sales of $23 million.
Borland, which is traded on the Unlisted Securities Market in Britain, said British analysts had generally predicted net of $800,000 to $1.3 million, on sales of $22 million to $23 million.
In the year-earlier period, Borland reported a $6.3 million loss due to a restructuring and posted sales of $19 million. 

A Borland spokesman attributed the unexpectedly strong performance to strong sales of Paradox, its relational data base.
The spokesman said Paradox is taking market share away from Ashton-Tate Corp., Torrance, Calif., the market leader, with its dBASE product. 

Borland is planning an initial public offering in the U.S. within 15 months.
Toward that end, it secured holder approval of a reverse split that increased its price in British trading to 555 pence, or $8.90 a share, a price the spokesman said was more acceptable to brokerages and investors in the U.S.
In U.K. trading yesterday, the price rose to 560 pence.
Shareholders also approved a re-incorporation in Delaware and authorized the issuance of 2.4 million additional shares, or 20% of the 12 million shares outstanding.
