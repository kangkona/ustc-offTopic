Westwood One Inc. posted a net loss of $13.5 million for the third quarter ended Aug. 31, the biggest quarterly net loss in its history, on record revenue of $36 million. 

More than $6.1 million of the loss resulted from the company's settlement of a class-action lawsuit in August.
That shareholder suit alleged that Westwood One, a producer and distributor of radio programs and owner of radio networks, provided "inaccurate financial information" to shareholders who bought its stock between Jan. 12 and May 31, 1988.
The loss also included about $5.6 million of interest expenses.
The company's long-term debt outstanding is about $185 million. 

In the year-earlier quarter, net income was $795,000, or six cents a share, on revenue of $27.1 million. 

In the first nine months, Westwood One had a net loss of $18.7 million, compared with year-earlier net income of $2.9 million, or 21 cents a share.
Revenue rose 9.5% to $92 million from $84 million.
