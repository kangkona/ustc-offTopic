Stocks tiptoed to record highs yesterday, though trading slowed to about half-speed because of the Columbus Day and Yom Kippur holidays. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose only 5.89 points, but that established another high at 2791.41; four such records were set last week.
New York Stock Exchange volume amounted to only 86.8 million shares. 

Trading in bonds and the dollar was limited because of the holiday. 

Money managers began selling some recent top-performing stocks, such as Federal National Mortgage Association, which dropped $1 a share to $135, and bought issues that have been beaten down to "cheap" levels, including many technology and energy stocks. 

The dollar rose sharply against the British pound yesterday.
In a dramatic slide, the pound plunged nearly three cents to $1.5775.
John Lipsky, an international economist at Salomon Brothers in London, said the boost in British interest rates last week wasn't enough to increase the pound's appeal relative to other currencies. 

In major market activity: 

Stocks climbed to record highs in light volume.
Other market measures also attained new highs; Standard & Poor's 500stock index rose 1.02 to a record 359.80.
The dollar rose against key currencies.
In late trading in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.8875 marks and 142.80 yen, compared with 1.8867 marks and 142.35 yen late Friday. 

The bond market was closed for the holiday.
But the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose about 1/4 point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount, in quiet trading in London.
