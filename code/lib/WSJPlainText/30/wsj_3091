Comerica Inc. sharply boosted its provisions for Latin American loan losses and said it expects the move to result in a third-quarter loss. 

The Detroit bank holding company raised its Latin American reserves $59 million to a total of $100 million, or 62.5% of its $160 million Latin American portfolio.
The action followed similar steps taken by other U.S. lenders to Latin American countries last month. 

With the added provisions, Comerica officials said they expect to report a third-quarter loss of 63 cents to 68 cents a share compared to earnings of $1.74 a share a year earlier.
The company said the aftertax impact of the reserves on third-quarter earnings will be equal to $2.46 a share. 

Comerica plans to release its third-quarter earnings by mid-October.
Through the first half of this year, Comerica had net income of $3.52 a share. 

Investors reacted negatively to the news Friday.
In over-the-counter trading, Comerica's common shares fell 75 cents, to $54.75. 

"By taking this reserve addition now, when our businesses are performing strongly, we obtain flexibility to manage the portfolio of assets in the future," said Eugene A. Miller, Comerica's president and chief executive officer. 

Comerica has Third World loans outstanding only to Mexico and Venezuela, two major oil producers whose economies have been weakened by the slump in crude oil prices in recent years.
The banking company said it has $95 million of loans to Mexico and $65 million to Venezuela. 

Comerica last raised its Latin American debt reserves in the 1987 second quarter, when it made provisions for 25% of the portfolio.
With the added provisions, Comerica's total loan-loss reserve is about $196 million, which includes about 1.3% of its $7.5 billion in domestic loans.
