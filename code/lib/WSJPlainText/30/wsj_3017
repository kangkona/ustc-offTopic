General Motors Corp. said it distributed about $377 million in special performance bonus payments to more than 364,000 eligible U.S. hourly employees as part of the auto maker's total cash compensation of its work force. 

The distribution, which averaged $1,030 for each worker, was the second and final such payment under the Detroit auto maker's existing labor agreements, which took effect October 1987 and are scheduled to expire September 1990.
The total amount of payments over the three years of the agreements was more than $747 million, GM said.
