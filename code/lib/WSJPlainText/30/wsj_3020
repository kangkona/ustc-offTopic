Broad Inc., Los Angeles, said it completed the divestiture of its SunAmerica financial services unit, the last step in an extensive restructuring. 

The divestiture has been accomplished through a co-insurance agreement with Savers Life Insurance Co. of America, a unit of Franklin Savings Association, an Ottawa, Kan., thrift, Broad said.
Under the agreement, Savers Life will re-insure $120 million of life and health insurance policies written by Broad's Sun Life Insurance Co. of America. 

Other terms weren't disclosed.
Broad, which had expected to complete the transaction last July, said it was delayed awaiting regulatory approval. 

In the past 18 months, Broad has disposed of other life insurance operations to focus on retirement-savings products, such as tax-deferred single premium and variable annuities. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Broad closed at $11.25 a share, unchanged.
