Regarding your Oct. 2 editorial "AARP's Catastrophe": We are deeply distressed that you repeat the unfair and unfounded allegation that AARP will profit from the prescription-drug benefit of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act.
That allegation was false when former HHS Secretary Joseph Califano and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association first made it more than a year ago.
Your repeating it doesn't make it any less false today. 

The facts are these: 

1.
Pharmacies will be reimbursed only for prescriptions sold to Medicare beneficiaries whose yearly prescription costs exceed the program's annual deductible, set at $800 for 1991, not for all prescriptions filled for Medicare patients; 

2.
Reimbursement will be the lower of either the retail price or the wholesale price plus $4.50.
Even in those instances where our Pharmacy Service is reimbursed, it will never be reimbursed for more than its actual retail price for the prescription; 

3.
An estimated 85% of our nonprofit, tax-paying Pharmacy Service's customer base will be Medicare-eligible in 1991.
But only 15% -- at most -- will be eligible for reimbursement.
Rather than receiving a "windfall," therefore, AARP's Pharmacy Service will have greater unreimbursed operating expenses under this prescription benefit program than any other retail pharmacy in the U.S. 

Finally, the Catastrophic Coverage Act is insurance paid for by its beneficiaries.
It is not a subsidy. 

Our founder, Ethel Percy Andrus, whom you mention, mandated us "not only to listen attentively to everything that is said on the issue at hand, but also as attentively to all that is not said." Unfortunately, in this public debate over the catastrophic legislation and its prescription-drug benefit, what is not being said is that there are millions of older people who still need it.
