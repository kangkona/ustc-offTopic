DNX, a small Princeton, N.J., biotechnology company, said Ohio University is receiving a patent on a technique for inserting new genes into animals, to which DNX will have exclusive rights. 

The patent covers the so-called microinjection process whereby bits of genetic material are injected by microscopic instruments into a single-cell animal embryo shortly after fertilization.
The injected genes are incorporated into the developing animal to create a "transgenic" animal, one which bears genes of other species.
The inserted genes are then passed on to succeeding generations. 

Most transgenic animals produced so far are mice bearing "foreign" genes, created mainly for research purposes.
However, attempts are being made to introduce new genes into livestock to give the animals better growth or disease-resistance traits.
Attempts also are being made to insert human genes that produce medically valuable proteins into mice, sheep, goats or cows.
The human proteins could then be extracted from the animals' milk in commercial quantities. 

The microinjection method was used to produce the first patented transgenic animal, the "Harvard Mouse," a laboratory mouse bearing foreign cancer genes. 

DNX said the new patent, which was applied for a decade ago, will be issued this week to Ohio University naming Thomas Wagner of the university's Edison Animal Biotechnology Center in Athens, Ohio, and Peter C. Hoppe of the nonprofit Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, as co-inventors. 

DNX was formed in March 1988, by the merger of Transgenics Corp., of Princeton, and Embryogen Inc., of Athens.
Embryogen was formed under a state of Ohio program to commercialize the university's biotechnology research.
DNX gained Embryogen's exclusive rights to inventions from the Edison center.
DNX is financed by a number of venture capital firms and counts the Ohio University Foundation among its stockholders.
