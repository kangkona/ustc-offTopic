The Los Angeles Times is expected to unveil a major overhaul of its layout tomorrow. 

The new design will feature a more open and airy format, industry analysts and officials say, but it won't be a jarring change from the style used by the newspaper since the 1970s. 

Among other things, the new design is expected to include indexes in many sections of the paper to steer readers through the more than 100 pages of newsprint that in the past have gained the Los Angeles Times a reputation as a difficult paper to read. 

There is also industry speculation that the new look may include a reworking of the paper's major sections, perhaps folding together certain sections for various days of the week. 

A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Times, which is the flagship publication of Times Mirror Co., confirmed that the paper plans to begin the new format tomorrow, but she declined to describe the changes. 

The Los Angeles Times has the fourth-largest weekday circulation and the third-largest Sunday circulation among North American newspapers.
