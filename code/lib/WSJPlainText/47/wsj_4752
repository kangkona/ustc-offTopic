Britain's longer leading cyclical indicator rose provisionally in August after turning higher in July, indicating that a two-year decline in the index may be at an end, the Central Statistical Office said. 

Other indices among the cyclical indicators, however, continued to show a slowdown in economic growth. 

The CSO cautioned that the August datadex were computed with only two of the five components of the index available, making the figure highly provisional.
