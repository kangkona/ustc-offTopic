The Nasdaq over-the-counter market drifted lower in lackluster trading despite a lot of takeover activity and a firmer technology sector, as ambivalent investors continued to move to the sidelines. 

The OTC market practically stood still for much of last week until Friday's small advance.
But yesterday, the Nasdaq Composite Index surrendered that gain, falling 1.36 to 466.71 on a paltry 108.1 million shares.
Still, its 0.3% decline compared favorable with the 0.8% drop posted by the New York Stock Exchange composite index. 

Among bigger stocks, the Nasdaq 100 Index was unchanged at 447.78, and the Nasdaq Financial Index fell 0.6%, or 2.58, to 460.43.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, by comparison, was off 0.8%. 

"The greatest factor out there is fear," said Reese Austin, first vice president at Morgan Keegan & Co. in Memphis. 

Although there is plenty of takeover action in the OTC market, Mr. Austin said, many money managers aren't interested in playing.
The investors have watched their portfolio values grow handsomely already this year, he said.
Now, they just want to protect their gains. 

"They worry that if they sell they will be wrong and if they buy they'll be wrong," Mr. Austin said. "Everything is in neutral right now.
It's tough for brokers because we like to wiggle money out of people, and we can't in this environment." 

On the takeover front, H.M.S.S. soared 14 1/8, or 41%, to 48 7/8 on 2.5 million shares, topping Nasdaq's most active list.
Secomerica agreed to acquire the provider of home infusion therapy services for $50 a share, or about $250 million, through a tender offer to begin this week. 

Secomerica is a subsidiary of Tokyo-based Secom, a provider of commercial and residential security services that recently has diversified into the communications and health services fields.
Michael S. Kaye, president and chief executive officer of Secomerica, said the company intends to preserve the current operating structure of H.M.S.S. 

The shares of other companies that provide home health care services rose in active trading on the H.M.S.S. news.
New England Critical Care gained 1 3/4 to 41 1/2 on 374,000 shares, although analysts said a takeover of New England Critical Care isn't necessarily imminent.
Care Plus jumped 1 1/2 to 9 7/8 on 358,000 shares. 

Overseas companies figured prominently in two other acquisition stories in the OTC market.
American depositary receipts of Tokio Marine & Fire Insurance surged 3 5/8 to 74 1/4.
The insurer has agreed to pay $42 million for 10% of Delaware Management Holding.
Under the agreement, Tokio Marine will receive newly issued Delaware Management shares and a seat on its board. 

Delaware Management said Tokio Marine will place substantial assets under management with the money management firm when the transaction is completed and will make additional contributions in the future. 

The ADRs of Jaguar, the British automaker, improved 5/32 to 9 9/32 on turnover of about two million shares.
Ford Motor has said it intends to buy as much as 15% of Jaguar. 

Adolph Coors Class B shares gained 1 1/2 to 23 3/4.
The brewer agreed in principle to acquire a substantial number of Stroh Brewery's facilities and brands for $425 million, as well as some of its liabilities.
Connaught Biosciences gained 3 1/8 to 31 3/4.
The company accepted a takeover bid from Institut Merieux of France, which topped an offer made jointly by Ciba-Geigy and Chiron.
Chiron, a biotechnology issue, rose 1/4 to 26 1/4. 

Nasdaq's biggest technology stocks were mostly higher.
MCI Communications rose 3/4 to 45 5/8 on 2.2 million shares; LIN Broadcasting gained 3 3/4 to 108 7/8 on speculation that McCaw Cellular might raise its bid for LIN, which has agreed to merge its domestic cellular telephone interests with BellSouth.
Apple Computer gained 3/8 to 45 1/4 on 1.2 million shares, Stratus Computer rose 1/2 to 24 1/2 on nearly 800,000 shares, Adobe Systems gained 3/8 to 16 7/8 on 1.1 million shares, and Microsoft rose 1 to 67, a 52-week high.
