The House Banking Committee approved a bill that would force regulators to require banks to establish "significantly greater" loan-loss reserves for troubled Third World loans. 

But the bill contains no specific targets for reserves, and banks that participate in the Treasury Department's plan to reduce Third World debt could hold smaller reserves than those that don't.
The Treasury plan, initiated by Secretary Nicholas Brady, stresses debt and debt-service reduction over new lending. 

The provision, sponsored by Rep. John LaFalce (D., N.Y.) and Rep. Walter Fauntroy (D., Washington, D.C.), was part of a larger bill authorizing $200 million for the Export-Import Bank, about $90 million for the Inter-American Development Bank and $150 million for interest-subsidy programs of the International Monetary Fund. 

The two congressmen had originally pushed for a provision requiring specific minimum loan-loss reserves, but the provision was watered down last week in subcommittee action.
Under the bill, regulators would be required to force banks to maintain loan-loss reserves "in general significantly greater than existing levels," according to a committee staff document.
But regulators can require smaller reserves for loans involved in Brady plan renegotiations of debt. 

Banking Committee Chairman Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) said decisions last week by Manufacturers Hanover, Chase Manhattan and Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. to voluntarily boost their reserves demonstrated that the legislation is "right on target." Mr. Gonzalez said that regulators "led by the Federal Reserve, should have been more forthcoming in having the banks increase their reserves" against Third World debt.
