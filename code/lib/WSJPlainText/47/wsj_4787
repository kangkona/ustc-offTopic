Tokio Marine & Fire Insurance Co. of Tokyo agreed to pay $42 million for a 10% stake in Delaware Management Holdings Inc., in the latest Japanese linkup with a U.S. money-management firm. 

The price agreed to by the world's largest property and casualty insurance company places an indicated value on the Philadelphia money-management firm far exceeding that paid in a leveraged buy-out of Delaware Management last year.
Since the buy-out, Delaware Management's assets under management have increased about a third to almost $24 billion. 

A leveraged-buy-out fund organized by New York merchant bank Castle Harlan Inc. and including Delaware Management's top executives acquired the firm for $305 million in mid-1988.
Most of the acquisition price represented assumption of Delaware Management's debt, which now stands at $200 million. 

The $42 million Tokio Marine agreed to pay suggests that acquisition of Delaware Management today would have an indicated cost of $420 million plus the assumption of $200 million in debt.
Delaware Management said it will use the money from Tokio Marine to reduce debt. 

Delaware Management's sharply higher value "reflects both the {rising} stock market and how well the company has performed," said Leonard Harlan, president of Castle Harlan.
He said Delaware Management and Tokio Marine would handle investments in each other's markets, giving clients "a two-way street with asset managers on both sides of the Pacific." 

Tokio Marine, a member of the Mitsubishi Group, will receive a seat on Delaware Management's board and can assign six professionals to obtain training from the U.S. firm.
Closing for the accord is expected next month. 

Nikko Securities Co. of Japan last summer agreed to buy a 50% stake in Wells Fargo Bank's money-management operation for $125 million.
Other Japanese firms have joint ventures with or ownership stakes in U.S. money managers.
