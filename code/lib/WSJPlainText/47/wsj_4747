Niagara Exchange Corp. said its Charleston Insurance Co. unit had substantial losses as a result of Hurricane Hugo, which hit Charleston, S.C. 

The investment fund didn't release figures but said the damage will cause the company to report a loss from operations in the third quarter ending Sept. 30 and possibly for the entire year. 

In the year-ago third quarter, Niagara had net income of $336,000, or 20 cents a share.
For the entire year, the company had net of $1.4 million, or 86 cents a share. 

Niagara said it is covered by catastrophe reinsurance, which should cover most of the loss.
Charleston Insurance has about 15,000 policies covering property in South Carolina.
