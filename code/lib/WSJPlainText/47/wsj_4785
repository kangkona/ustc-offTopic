President Bush's bad luck with trees is growing. 

Mr. Bush has launched a coast-to-coast campaign urging Americans to plant trees because of their ecological benefits, but his latest personal contribution has been uprooted.
Over the weekend, vandals yanked out of the ground an elm sapling he planted just a week ago in Spokane, Wash., and White House officials said they don't know whether the tree can be saved. 

The damage to the Spokane tree follows on the heels of complications with an elm tree Mr. Bush gave to North Dakota several months ago.
That tree turned out to have gypsy moths, destructive insects that state officials said North Dakota didn't have before Mr. Bush brought in his tree. 

The elm sapling Mr. Bush planted in Spokane was taken from a tree John Quincy Adams planted on the White House grounds in 1826.
After White House aides found out vandals had uprooted the sapling and torn off some branches, they called Spokane officials to offer assistance in saving or replacing it.
The aides said that the tree has been taken to a "secure location" and that Spokane officials hope it will recuperate over the winter. 

Nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack, the aides said.
