Quadra Logic Technologies Inc. said it plans to issue three million new common shares, $5 million of which will be sold to its 15.2%-owner, American Cyanamid Co. 

Terms of the offering, which is expected by late October, weren't disclosed.
In national over-the-counter trading, Quadra Logic closed at $7.50 a share, down 75 cents, giving the planned share issue a current market value of about $22.5 million.
A Quadra Logic official said American Cyanamid's stake in the company wouldn't be affected by the offering. 

In a related announcement, Quadra Logic, a biopharmaceutical concern that is developing an anti-cancer drug, Photofrin, said it expects to receive as much as $8 million from American Cyanamid for marketing and distribution rights to products being developed to treat venereal warts and psoriasis.
The accord, which requires board approvals, provides, among other things, for American Cyanamid to co-develop the products. 

Quadra Logic said American Cyanamid also agreed to provide a secured loan of as much as $10 million to help finance further development of Photofrin, a light-activated compound that generates toxic chemicals that kill cancer cells.
Quadra Logic is currently seeking Canadian regulatory approval to sell the drug in Canada.
