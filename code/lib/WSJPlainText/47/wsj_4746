Aluminum-ingot prices are expected to remain "firm" through 1991 after falling from peak levels a year ago, said David Morton, chairman and chief executive officer of Alcan Aluminium Ltd. 

Ingot is cast molton metal that is rolled into sheets for use in making beverage cans, airplane and auto parts, and other products.
Alcan is a large integrated producer of aluminum ingot and fabricated products. 

"I expect to see relative stability" in the aluminum market, Mr. Morton told reporters at an aluminum-industry conference here.
He said he expects ingot prices to vary "plus or minus five cents U.S." a pound from current levels of about 80 cents a pound, assuming there isn't a full recession, which he said he doesn't expect. "All the evidence of a soft landing is there to see," he said. 

In 1988, prices for aluminum ingot climbed as high as $1.12. 

Mr. Morton said 2% annual growth in aluminum demand through 1991 will absorb any new production capacity coming on stream during that period.
He added that Alcan believes completion of much of the new capacity announced or under construction will be "squeezed forward to 1992-1993," or about a year later than planned. 

He said that if demand grows at an annual rate greater than 2% between now and 1992 the new capacity, much of it being built in Quebec, will be welcome. "We need people to build {new aluminum smelters}, just not too fast," Mr. Morton said.
