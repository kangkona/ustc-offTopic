The country's newest daily newspaper rolled off the presses here yesterday.
Ingersoll Publications Co. 's St. Louis Sun, a tabloid, made its first front page story itself. 

The headline on page one read "Sunrise," with the photograph of a sunrise through the St. Louis Arch and stories inside on the launch of the newspaper.
Publisher Thomas Tallarico said the Sun's first print run was 200,000 copies.
The newspaper starts with 55,000 home subscriptions.
Sun vending boxes in downtown St. Louis were empty by midmorning, Mr. Tallarico said. 

The Sun is expected to settle down to a daily circulation of about 100,000.
The first issue was 128 pages, of which about 70 were ad pages. 

The Sun is attempting to be the first new daily newspaper to successfully publish -- without the help of subsidies -- in a major metropolitan market since World War II.
The Sun breaks the monopoly of Pulitzer Publishing Co. 's St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
