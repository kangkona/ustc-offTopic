Your Aug. 28 "Centennial Journal" item "Japanese Start a Successful Drive, 1960" states: "Nissan picked Datsun, derived from the Japanese for 'running away fast, ' as the name for its special U.S. brand." 

Another explanation is given in the definitive "Complete Encyclopedia of Motorcars," edited by G.N. Georgano.
It says Kwaishinsha Motor Car Works of Tokyo in 1912 produced the DAT, which stood for the initials of its founders' last names.
In 1931 the company brought out a new, smaller car called Son-of-DAT, or simply "Datson," which changed to Datsun in 1932 to honor Japan's national symbol. 

In 1934, through a buy-out, the company name was changed to Nissan.
It still made Datsuns and introduced the first Nissan brand car in 1937.
The firm abandoned the name Nissan after the war, but Datsun and Japanese Austins continued to be built.
Finally, in 1960, the name Nissan returned on their larger car. "Datsun" was always the preferred marque around the world for the company's cars, while "Nissan" was used primarily on trucks.
Sadly, in 1983, the proud, famous and older brand was retired.
I still am not sure why Nissan chose to spend vast sums of money to replace a time-proven, world-famous name.
