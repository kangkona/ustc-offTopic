Placer Dome Inc., a big gold producer, said it may buy back as many as 16.4 million, or about 7% of its 234.7 million common shares outstanding. 

Placer Dome, Vancouver, British Columbia, said the proposed share repurchase, which may be made periodically on the Toronto Stock Exchange between tomorrow and Sept. 27, 1990, is an "appropriate" use of funds since the company believes its shares are undervalued. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Placer Dome's shares closed at $16.125 each, down 12.5 cents.
Placer Dome said it would cancel any shares it repurchases. 

A Placer Dome spokesman said the proposed repurchase wouldn't deter the company from pursuing acquisitions.
He said Placer Dome expects to have about 650 million Canadian dollars (US$552.4 million) of cash on hand a year from now, if it buys back all 16.4 million shares.
That is roughly equal to the company's current cash position, he said.
