Telos Corp. said it signed a $20 million contract with Jet Propulsion Laboratories for software engineering services over a three-year period. 

Telos, a defense-oriented computer concern, said the contract has a maximum value of $60 million, depending on the amount of work required by Jet, a closely held research concern based in Pasadena, Calif. 

Telos, based here, said it provides extensive services to Jet under a total of six contracts, of which this is the largest.
