I much enjoyed your Aug. 31 page-one piece about "Desert Island Discs." However, it is incorrect to describe the BBC as "state owned." 

Many British governments may have wished that they owned the BBC, but none have succeeded.
The BBC is a public corporation with full editorial and managerial independence.
Its source of income is the license fee levied on every household containing a television set.
