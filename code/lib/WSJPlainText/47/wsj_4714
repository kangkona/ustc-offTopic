International Power Machines Corp. and Smith Laboratories Inc. scrapped plans to merge in the face of stockholder resistance. 

A spokesman for International Power said no reason for the cancellation of the agreement would be disclosed because such information is "not vital public information." 

However, earlier this month, a large, individual stockholder in Smith Laboratories, Joel Rocha Garza, said he would seek to block the proposed transaction.
As of Sept. 8, Mr. Garza and his company, Clarendon Group Ltd., had an 8.46% stake in Smith Laboratories. 

Smith Laboratories is a San Diego drug maker.
International Power Machines is a Garland, Texas, maker of uninterruptible power systems.
