Hill Samuel Bank Ltd. is proposing that Ferranti International Signal PLC split in two to bolster the U.K. defense equipment maker's finances in light of a major contract scandal. 

Sources said the proposal by Hill Samuel, an investment bank, would split Ferranti by giving shareholders separate shares in the part of the company involved in the scandal, International Signal & Control, which is based in Lancaster, Pa., and in the remaining businesses. 

"There would be one good, viable business and one with a question mark," a source familiar with the plan said. 

A third party could be brought in as a minority shareholder to further support Ferranti after the break up, the sources said. 

Hill Samuel, a unit of TSB Group PLC, entered talks Monday with Ferranti's financial advisers, Baring Bros.
Ltd., the sources said.
The Hill Samuel plan is only one of several being considered. 

A spokeswoman for Murray Johnstone Ltd., a Glasgow fund management firm working with Hill Samuel on the plan, described the talks as "preliminary." 

The break-up option is being touted as a way for Ferranti to maintain its independence better in the face of a possibly substantial asset write-off on the resolution of the contract scandal. 

Ferranti so far hasn't commented on the various proposals.
The company, whose shares were suspended from trading Sept. 11, has said it may have been defrauded on contracts involving Middle Eastern customers.
Analysts value the contracts at 150 million to 200 million pounds ($235.7 million to $314.3 million).
If Ferranti were to write off payments of that size, it could halve its net asset value. 

Hill Samuel has already approached at least one British company, Thorn EMI PLC, about buying a stake in the more-favored half of Ferranti.
