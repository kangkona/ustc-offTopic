Take It Away] 

Some take umbrage, 

Some take heart, 

Some take it easy, 

Many take part. 

Some take offense, 

Others take note, 

Some take pains 

And some a straw vote. 

Many take pleasure, 

All take time; 

I'm nearly finished 

With my rhyme. 

The world's a place 

(And no mistaking) 

Where everything's up 

For the taking.
