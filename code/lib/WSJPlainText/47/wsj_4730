In a last-gasp effort to save the catastrophic-illness insurance program, senior Democrats in the House intend to offer a plan that would end the program's controversial income-tax surcharge and reduce its benefits significantly. 

The House Rules Committee yesterday agreed to permit a vote in the full House for the proposal, authored by Rep. Fortney Stark (D., Calif.), among others.
The plan would end the surtax, which was deeply disliked by senior citizens, and cut some of the program's most costly benefits, including elements of hospital and physician coverage and skilled nursing-home care. 

The proposal would keep other parts, including coverage for prescription-drug purchases and measures that prevent the impoverishment of spouses in the event of a "catastrophic illness." The Rules Committee decided that the plan could be voted on even though initially it would be more costly, in violation of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. 

As expected, the rules panel also agreed to permit a vote on full repeal of the program, even though the repeal too would cost the Treasury vast amounts of money.
Although Rep. Stark is a leader on health-care issues, his plan faces long odds, and leaders of both parties concede that repeal is the most likely outcome.
