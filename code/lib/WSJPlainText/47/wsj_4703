France's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 9.5% in August from 9.6% in July, the social-affairs ministry said. 

Comparable year-earlier figures weren't immediately available because the base for calculating the unemployment rate was readjusted in July. 

The ministry said the total number of job seekers eased 0.6% in August to an adjusted 2,531,600.
