Scientists found hints that a gene already linked to colon cancer may also be involved in lung cancer. 

The gene, when it functions normally, is believed to suppress abnormal cell growth.
But as a result of research published in April, scientists believe that when the gene mutates, it allows cells to grow aberrantly into a malignancy.
Since April, several teams have been searching in other cancers for the gene, known as p53. 

At a symposium funded by Bristol-Myers Co. in Toronto, a researcher from the U.S. government's National Cancer Institute said he found evidence of mutated forms of the p53 gene in studies of lung cancer tissue.
The researcher, John Minna, has yet to publish the findings.
He said that he expected the defective gene to be one of 10 to 20 genetic abnormalities that must accumulate to trigger and then spread a malignancy in the lung. 

Researchers hope that discovery of the p53 gene will eventually lead to diagnostic tests that would identify who is at risk of developing certain cancers.
Eventually, scientists also hope to use the gene to develop ways of slowing or perhaps blocking a cancer's growth. 

The p53 gene was first identified earlier this year by Bert Vogelstein, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University.
Dr. Vogelstein believes p53 is one of about four to six genes that are involved in turning healthy colon tissue cancerous.
His research suggests that the p53 gene is somehow damaged, perhaps by a carcinogen, and becomes deactivated.
Some people may inherit the gene in a damaged form, thus predisposing them to a cancer. 

Several teams are also searching for the gene in cancers of the breast, bladder and other organs.
The gene is the second of the newly identified class of cancer genes called tumor suppressors.
The first, discovered in 1986, causes a rare eye cancer called retinoblastoma.
