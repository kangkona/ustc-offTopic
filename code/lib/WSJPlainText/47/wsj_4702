Telesphere International Inc. said it expects that earnings for the third quarter will reach as much as $1.7 million, on revenue of about $52 million. 

In the year-earlier quarter, the Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., telecommunications concern had a loss of $3.9 million, on revenue of $29.9 million. 

Telesphere also said that revenue for the fourth quarter is expected to be about $55 million, with estimated pretax profit of $3 million.
In the fourth quarter of 1988, the company had a loss of $28.3 million, on revenue of $27.7 million. 

The company said the improved earnings would reflect planned lower operating expenses and a potential decrease in bad-debt provisions.
Telesphere added that the increase in revenue reflects continued growth in its business, primarily its 900 phone service.
Telesphere noted that the fourth quarter is historically the slowest quarter of the year. 

Telesphere also said its shareholders, at the annual meeting held yesterday, approved a change in the company's name to Telesphere Communications Inc.
