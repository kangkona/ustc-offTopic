General Homes Corp. said it proposed swapping its $140 million in subordinated debt for stock that will be equal to about 75.5% of the home builder's equity. 

Under an amended registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, General Homes said it proposes to offer 425 shares of new Series B voting preferred stock for each $1,000 face value of subordinated notes.
The company has two issues of subordinated debt, 12 3/4% subordinated notes due 1998 and 15 1/2% subordinated notes due 1995. 

Each of the Series B shares will be convertible into one share of common.
The company previously planned to offer zero-coupon notes to subordinated debtholders. 

General Homes has been trying for more than a year to restructure about $250 million in senior debt and its subordinated debt to avoid a bankruptcy-law filing. 

Earlier this year, the company reached an agreement wtih senior lenders to convert that senior debt into a $100 million revolving loan, a $90 million five-year, amortizing, interest-bearing loan and a $60 million, noninterest bearing term loan.
In exchange for interest on the smallest loan, senior lenders will receive Series A convertible preferred stock equal to about 15% of General Homes' equity. 

The company said it plans a one-for-two reverse split of its common, which will leave current stockholders with about 9.5% of the company's equity after the restructuring. 

The restructuring is subject to shareholder approval, 90% of the subordinated notes being tendered under an exchange offer, and completion of the senior-debt restructuring.
