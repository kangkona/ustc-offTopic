European Community Commission ministers are set to discuss proposals that would give pharmaceutical makers the option to add 10 years to the 20-year patents on new drugs. 

European drug makers say it's taking longer and costing more to bring new products to the market, as research and development become increasingly sophisticated and approval processes lengthen. 

In major EC nations, patents last for 20 years.
But because patents are sought early on with discoveries, effective protection is much shorter.
It takes an average 12 years to come up with a marketable drug following a patented discovery, leaving just eight years of effective protection under the patent.
Pharmaceutical companies say this doesn't make it financially worthwile to research new drugs. 

Adding 10 years would lengthen effective protection to about 18 years, in line with effective protection of 15 to 16 years in the U.S. and Japan, commission officials say. 

Longer patent protection would have highly sensitive political implications because of the possible effect on surging social-security costs in the EC, where many countries offer generous healthcare reimbursements.
Other pharmaceutical makers would have to wait longer before selling cheaper, generic versions of the drugs, causing consumer groups to object.
