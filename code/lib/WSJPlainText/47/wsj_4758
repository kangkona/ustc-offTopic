Italy's industrial wholesale sales index rose 10.5% in May from a year earlier, according to Istat, the state statistical institute. 

Istat said the index, which has a base of 1985 equals 100, registered 139.5 in May.
A comparable year-earlier figure wasn't available because Istat revised the index at the beginning of this year. 

The May increase compared with a rise of 11.4% in April from a year earlier.
For the first five months of 1989, wholesale sales rose 12% from a year earlier.
