Re Capital Corp. said it plans to buy as much as $2.5 million of its common stock in the open market. 

The company said the buy-back program supplements existing plans that have so far repurchased 1.2 million shares. 

At the company's current market price of $11.75, the new buy-back program could result in the repurchase of more than 210,000 shares, or about 3% of the 6.8 million shares the company had outstanding as of June 30.
