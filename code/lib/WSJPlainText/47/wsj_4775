Your Aug. 23 article "For Consumers, Ecology Comes Second" suggests that consumers care more about short-term personal convenience than long-term planetary well-being.
Wendy's and Procter & Gamble report customer indifference to the environmental benefits of concentrated products and biodegradable packaging.
But have these customers ever been fully apprised of these advantages by the manufacturers? 

For decades manufacturers have used advertising to instruct consumers about what makes their product better than their competitors'.
They have been quick to publicize whatever features were trendy or desirable (i.e., low-calorie, high-fiber, cavity-fighting, anti-plaque, fast-acting, etc.).
So why not environmentally beneficial promotions for products that protect our planet?
Consumers who bought the high-fiber pitch for healthy bodies might very plausibly buy the notion of preserving a healthy planet.
I know I would.
