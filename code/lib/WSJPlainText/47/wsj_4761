Morgan Stanley & Co. and Kidder, Peabody & Co. continued their nose-to-nose program-trading battle in August on the New York Stock Exchange. 

Morgan Stanley displaced Kidder as the top user of the controversial computer-generated trading practice last month; the firms accounted for 89.1 million shares and 76.2 million shares, respectively, in August.
In July, Kidder outpaced second-place Morgan Stanley by more than 20 million shares. 

Overall, program trading accounted for 10.3% of average daily volume in August, up from 9.4% in July, the exchange said.
Program volume reached an average of 17.7 million shares daily, compared with 15.3 million in July. 

The Big Board defines program trading as any of a number of strategies involving the purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or more stocks. 

Brokerage firms argue that strategies such as stock-index arbitrage -- rapid trading between stock-index futures and stocks to capture fleeting price differences -- link two related markets and thus benefit both.
In August, 64.7% of program trades on the Big Board involved index arbitrage, compared with 59.8% in July. 

Opponents contend that these strategies produce sharp market swings that frighten away small investors, and some argued that program trading contributed to the 1987 market crash. 

Following Morgan Stanley Group Inc. 's unit and General Electric Co. 's Kidder unit in August program trading were Susquehanna Investment Group with 34 million shares; Merrill Lynch & Co., 32.6 million; and CS First Boston Group's First Boston Corp. unit, 31.9 million.
