Shares of Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. face suspension from trading on the Australian Stock Exchange in October because the company says it can't produce its annual accounts on time. 

The company's fiscal year ended June 30.
Under exchange rules, it must submit preliminary results by Sept. 30 and audited accounts by Oct. 31. 

If a company's results aren't completed on time the exchange grants a 16 working-day grace period and then suspends the stock. 

Bond Corp. yesterday blamed its reporting delay on a previously announced inquiry into various company transactions by Australia's National Companies and Securities Commission, which Bond Corp. directors said has "impeded the progress of the audit." 

"Certain Bond group executives and auditors are being required to travel" to the inquiry in Melbourne from their headquarters on the west coast, the company said in a statement that warned shareholders of expected delays with its accounts.
