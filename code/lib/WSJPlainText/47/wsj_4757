Eight major business groups formed the Business Coalition for Education Reform to promote improvements in the nation's public schools. 

"The strength of the American economy rests on the strength of America's public schools," said William Kolberg, president of the National Alliance of Business and co-chairman of the coalition. "If we are to remain economically competitive, then our schools must assure that our young people obtain the knowledge and skills necessary for a life-long opportunity of productive employment." 

A number of businesses and business groups already are working to improve schools.
In recent years, many companies have aided schools or school systems with money and manpower.
Mr. Kolberg said the coalition will give business a stronger voice in current efforts to improve U.S. education. 

The coalition members include: American Business Conference, Business Roundtable, Committee for Economic Development, the Conference Board, National Alliance of Business, National Association of Manufacturers, U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
