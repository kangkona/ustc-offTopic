A group led by Merrill Lynch & Co., as expected, definitively agreed to buy the Del Monte canned-food business from RJR Nabisco Inc. for $1.48 billion. 

The investor group, which stepped in for Citicorp Venture Capital, received commitments for all of the financing necessary to complete the transaction.
Senior bank financing will come from First National Bank of Chicago, Citibank, a unit of Citicorp, Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. and Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole. 

The investor group also includes Del Monte senior management, Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd. and Kikkoman Corp.
In addition to its equity investment, Kikkoman agreed in principle to buy certain Del Monte's Far Eastern assets.
Included in the businesses the investor group is acquiring are Del Monte Foods USA and Del Monte Foods Europe.
The group isn't buying certain operations, including Nabisco food businesses in Latin America, which Del Monte has managed.
RJR Nabisco is retaining those businesses, which have projected operating profit in 1989 of about $92 million.
With this agreement, RJR effectively completes its last major transaction in its plan to sell $5.5 billion of food assets within the first year after its record $25 billion leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
