American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled two facsimile offerings: a group of messaging services and a fax machine that includes both a fax line and a telephone line. 

AT&T Enhanced Fax is a group of services -- including fax mailboxes, fax forwarding, and mass-faxing capability -- aimed at giving users greater flexibility. 

Faxes can be sent to a personal "mailbox," which the addressee enters with an identification code.
Faxes also can be forwarded from a mailbox to a designated fax machine.
Users of Enhanced Fax also can send messages to thousands of destinations nearly simultaneously, AT&T said. 

The twin-line fax machine allows a caller to speak to his or her party while faxing a document.
The model 9015PF can sit on a desktop or can be portable.
