For the quarter ended Aug. 31, the company had profit of $193,000, or three cents a share, before an extraordinary gain, compared with a loss of $1.5 million a year ago, before an extraordinary gain.
Revenue rose 7.3% to $20 million from $18.7 million.

Peter Boni, On-Line Software's president, said the revenue improvement was related to the company's software products.
