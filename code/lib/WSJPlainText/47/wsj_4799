Venezuela and its main commercial banks are near agreement on a short-term bank loan of more than $590 million to enable that country to catch up on overdue interest payments, bankers and officials said. 

During the past few months, Venezuela has fallen more than $700 million behind on interest payments to its commercial-bank creditors.
The country plans to use some of its own foreign-exchange reserves and the planned new loan to pay off the arrears, the same sources said. 

That would be a prelude to a more comprehensive debt settlement between Venezuela and its banks.
That arrangement is expected to include new lending and some options for reducing debt and interest, according to bankers attending the annual meetings here of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 

Venezuela has about $30 billion of foreign debt, mostly owed to commercial banks.
The country is rich in oil and mineral resources and it has considerable foreign-exchange and gold reserves, so its foreign-debt problems aren't as intractable as those of many other Latin American countries.
During the past 18 months, it has succeeded in making some small borrowings in the international-capital market. 

But fired by U.S. rhetoric on the need for reductions in debt and debt-service costs, Venezuela recently sought a 50% cut in its foreign-bank debt or in its interest payments.
That was flatly rejected by its bankers.
The Venezuelans seem to be coming round to a proposal that places more emphasis on continued access to credit and less on slashing old loans.
