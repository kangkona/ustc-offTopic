Tandem Computers Inc. will announce a powerful new parallel processing mainframe on Monday which it said will, under certain circumstances, provide about the same performance as International Business Machines Corp. 's 3090 mainframe for as little as one-third the cost. 

The new machine, called the Cyclone, will be priced starting at $2 million.
It will offer four to 16 processors working in parallel, which allows it to process certain kinds of data much faster than computers with fewer processors.
Tandem also has introduced new software that enhances the ability of data processors to retrieve and sort information at high speeds.
The company declined to provide more details about the machine, or its delivery date. 

Tandem's stock price has jumped 68% from its low of last April, when it announced an unexpected sales shortage, and is up about 20% from its highs early in the year.
It closed yesterday at $24.75, up 75 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

In 1988, Tandem earned $94.5 million, or 96 cents a share, on sales of $1.31 billion.
A consensus of analysts' estimates puts the company's 1989 earnings at $1.14 to $1.20 a share, and sales of $1.61 billion to $1.64 billion.
