Hollywood Park Realty Enterprises Inc. and Hollywood Park Operating Co., Inglewood, Calif., said they reached an agreement to nominate dissident investor Thomas W. Gamel as director of both companies, whose stock is paired for trading. 

Mr. Gamel, a Denver investor who holds more than a 5% stake in the companies, had threatened a proxy fight.
He now has agreed to withdraw the slate he previously nominated and to vote his shares in favor of the boards' nominees. 

The agreement prevents Mr. Gamel from acquiring additional stock of the companies without obtaining prior approval from the companies, soliciting any proxies or consents, "or engaging in any conduct calculated to result in an acquisition of the companies or their assets" or assisting anyone else in doing so.
Hollywood Park Realty is a real estate investment trust that leases race track operations to Hollywood Park Operating.
