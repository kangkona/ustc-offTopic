Banca Nazionale del Lavoro's board approved details of a previously announced capital-raising deal, paving the way for the relisting of the bank's nonvoting savings shares. 

Trading in those shares was suspended Sept. 5 after BNL disclosed that its Atlanta branch had made $2.64 billion of lending commitments to Iraq without proper authorization.
Consob, the Italian stock exchange watchdog, said last week the shares could resume trading once the market was given full information about the cash-raising operation. 

Separately, state-owned BNL, which is Italy's biggest bank, said gross profit had "significantly improved" in the first eight months of 1989.
For the banking division alone, gross profit was 536 billion lire ($381.9 million), BNL said.
Comparable year-earlier figures weren't available, but for all of 1988, BNL had a net of 209 billion lire. 

The board said the capital-raising operation, which calls for two state agencies to inject 808 billion lire into BNL, involves the issue of ordinary shares priced at 32,400 lire each ($23.09). 

The deal must be approved by a special shareholders meeting Oct. 19.
The state insurance fund will increase its stake to 20.2% from 12.1%, while the national pension fund will increase its stake to 17.2% from 8.5%. 

The Italian Treasury will reduce its BNL stake to about 58.8% from 74.5%.
However, that stake could increase later when the Treasury injects 348 billion lire of new capital into the bank. i3
