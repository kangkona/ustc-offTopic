Warner-Lambert Co., Morris Plains, N.J., said it licensed an advanced quinolone antibacterial drug from Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Osaka, Japan. 

The agreement gives Warner-Lambert, a health-care and consumer products company, rights to the product in the U.S. and Canada.
It already licenses a related antibacterial, enoxacin, sold under the name Comprecin, from Dainippon; that drug is marketed in 10 countries and is expected to be approved for U.S. marketing later this year. 

Warner-Lambart said the latest licensed product is expected to be marketed in the mid-1990s. 

A spokesman said Comprecin is used for certain types of infections such as urinary tract, while the new drug appears to be effective against skin and respiratory tract infections as well as pelvic inflammatory disease, a leading cause of infertility.
