Francaise des Petroles (CFP) said its consolidated net profit surged to 1.709 billion French francs ($267 million) in the first half of 1989 from 237 million francs ($37 million) a year earlier and 1.479 billion francs ($231 million) for all of 1988. 

The state-controlled French oil group said that its first-half profit included a contribution of 1.47 billion francs from an upward adjustment of the value of its oil inventories following a rise in energy prices.
This was in contrast with the comparable year-earlier period, when downward pressure on oil prices lopped 390 million francs from the value of the group's stocks. 

Total's consolidated revenue climbed 28% in the first half to 51.131 billion francs from 40.027 billion a year earlier.
The group explained that the advance was fueled by a gain in volume terms that was further boosted by the firm tone of oil prices and the dollar's advance.
