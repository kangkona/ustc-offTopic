EG&G Inc. said it received a four-year $2.5 billion contract to manage and operate the Energy Department's Rocky Flats nuclear-weapons plant near Denver. 

The agency last month said it would award the contract to EG&G, which manages federal facilities and makes scientific instruments.
The current manager, Rockwell International Corp., is embroiled in controversy over the management of the plant and has been charged by the Energy Department with failing to make enough environmental, health and safety improvements to the facility. 

Terms call for EG&G to assume control of the plant from Rockwell during a transition period from now through Jan. 1.
EG&G said it can negotiate additional terms and conditions of the contract during the transition.
The contract calls for EG&G to manage the facility through Dec. 31, 1993. 

In the contract's first year, the plant's management budget is $500 million, with a fixed fee of $15 million that will be paid to EG&G for managing it, EG&G said. 

For the year ended Jan. 1, 1989, EG&G had net income of $68.7 million, or $2.30 a share, on sales of $1.41 billion.
