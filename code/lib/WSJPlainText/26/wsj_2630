(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

IN 1971, THE U.S. HAD ITS FIRST TRADE DEFICIT since 1888.
It began a headache that won't go away. 

Surging imports of Japanese cars and TV sets, European goods, Middle Eastern oil and other-nation raw materials topped U.S. exports by $2.05 billion.
Just the prior year the U.S. had a trade surplus of $2.7 billion. 

The out-of-kilter trade had caused President Nixon on Aug. 15 to slap -- briefly -- a 10% surcharge on goods accounting for about half the $45 billion annual imports then. (He also allowed the dollar to float freely, unpegged to gold, against foreign currencies.
Overvalued dollars, high U.S. oil imports and Japanese competition were the main culprits for U.S. trade imbalances.) 

"Made in the U.S.A." lost its luster, and protectionist pressure rose.
Treasury Secretary John Connally as early as the prior May -- the first time in more than 20 years that U.S. trade was in the red two months in a row -- said the U.S. should "get tough" with its trading partners. 

Britain, Canada and other nations beefed about the 10% surcharge, claiming it was illegal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Nixon killed it on Dec. 20, 1971, as he devalued the dollar by raising the official gold price 8.57%. 

Trade deficits have been recorded for the past 13 years in a row.
The figure will be more than $100 billion this year, analysts say, compared with $118 billion in 1988 and the record $152 billion in 1987.
Rightly or wrongly, but not necessarily rationally, currency traders and others use the monthly figures as an excuse to buy or sell if the deficit is more or less than predictions, notes a Commerce Department official.
