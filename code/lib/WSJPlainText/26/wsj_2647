Hooray for your Sept. 20 editorial "The Privileged Class" on the increasing acceptance of diverse people and ideas on American campuses.
Our educational environment influences the thinking habits of tomorrow's workers and thereby our ability to compete in the world marketplace.
The quiet but pervasive suppression of divergent ideas on college campuses has encouraged an emphasis in academia and in the workplace on conformity rather than on contribution as a means to success. 

The U.S. cannot hope to reverse its declining leadership role until we resurrect the qualities of Yankee ingenuity and adaptability.
Our education system must serve as a wellspring of intellectual debate and training, not as a means of perpetuating complacency.
To restrict the entrance of unconventional people or ideas to educational discussion is to sabotage our growth, our ability to compete and ultimately our survival. 

The penalty of promoting a privileged orientation in academia is the enervation of the American intellect.
