The University of Toronto is considering an out-of-court settlement of its suit to block the proposed acquisition of Connaught BioSciences Inc. by a French company for 942 million Canadian dollars (US$801.6 million). 

An Ontario Supreme Court judge yesterday adjourned hearing of the suit until Oct. 18, to give university officials time to study the proposal, which was made by Connaught.
The company declined to describe the proposed settlement and university officials weren't available. 

In the suit, the university claims that the transfer of control of Connaught to a non-Canadian concern would violate the terms of a 1972 agreement between the university and the Canadian government.
Connaught contends the agreement doesn't prevent a sale. 

Connaught is the target of a C$37-a-share offer by Institut Merieux S.A. of France, a 50.2%-owned unit of Rhone-Poulenc S.A., which expires Oct. 26.
A rival, C$30-a-share bid by Ciba-Geigy Ltd. of Switzerland and Chiron Corp., based in Emeryville, Calif., expires Tuesday. 

In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Connaught closed at $30.25, up 25 cents.
