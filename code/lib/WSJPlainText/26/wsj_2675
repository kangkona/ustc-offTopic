Bank of New England Corp. said in Boston that it signed a preliminary agreement to negotiate exclusively "for a short period of time" with Bank of Tokyo Ltd. for the sale of part of Bank of New England's leasing business to the Japanese bank. 

The U.S. bank holding company earlier was reported to be negotiating with Bank of Tokyo and at least one other potential buyer of its leasing operations.
Bank of New England said it is considering the sale because tax law changes have made the leasing business "less attractive." The company added that its leasing business is mainly outside New England, and it has made a "strategic decision" to concentrate its resources in New England. 

Bank of New England listed $2 billion in leasing assets in its most recent annual report.
The leasing business handles commuter rail cars, aircraft and other equipment, according to the report.
