John LeBoutillier's arguments to "Normalize Ties With Vietnam Now" (editorial page, Sept. 15) should awaken Americans to the startling divergence between foreign policy as presented to the public and foreign policy in actual practice.
He states this point dramatically when he refers to the State Department's public pronouncements against the Khmer Rouge on the same day it agreed with China to let the Khmer Rouge take part in a new Cambodian government. 

Even more glaring has been the repeated declaration since 1980 about the recovery of POWs in Vietnam being of the highest national priority while actually placing much higher priority on the conflicting policy of supporting military action against the Vietnamese in Cambodia.
None of the evidence on POWs has been made public -- apparently because the public would then reverse these priorities -- and the organization of POW families has been co-opted for the sake of maintaining these priorities. 

The Vietnamese desperately want the ties that will lead to favorable aid and trade activities; POWs would be the only bargaining chip they have.
If we unite with the Vietnamese in their opposition to the Khmer Rouge, while showing some genuine seriousness about negotiating the POW issue, we may find that both these problems will be solved simultaneously.
