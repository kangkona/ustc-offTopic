Chase Manhattan Corp. reported, as expected, a net loss for the third quarter of $1.11 billion, or $12.45 a share, following a massive addition to reserves for possible losses on loans primarily to developing countries. 

During the year-ago quarter, the bankholding company reported earnings of $283 million, or $3.09 a share, including a onetime gain of $103 million after taxes on the settlement of certain pension obligations and $80 million of income tax benefits. 

For the first nine months of this year, Chase had a loss of $840 million, or $10.01 a share.
For the same period last year, earnings were $784 million, or $8.62 a share, including $292 million in one-time gains and $155 million of tax benefits. 

Last month, Chase sought to silence nagging investor concerns about its developing country debt-portfolio, bad real estate loans at its Arizona bank and unprofitable securities trading operations by making a $1.26 billion after-tax addition to its loan loss reserves. 

Willard C. Butcher, Chase chairman, said at the time that the move would boost its reserve for developing countries loans to 46% of its exposure and eliminate a $200 million-a-year drag on Chase's earnings. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Chase shares closed at $43.75 a share, down $1. 

Despite the third-quarter loss, securities analysts found reason to cheer quarterly comparisons of Chase's underlying operating earnings.
Core earnings were up 15% to $151 million, $1.45 a share, from $130 million, or $1.32 a share, the year earlier. 

James J. McDermott, research director for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., said, "Core earnings are up nicely.
I think they're on track and are going to recoup that $200 million drag on earnings." 

Mr. McDermott cited Chase's slimmer net interest margin -- the difference between what it pays and charges for money -- as one disappointment.
The margin dropped to 3.23% from 3.52% a year ago.
Chase's margin may end up being narrower than most banks because it cut its prime rate, the benchmark for domestic lending, during the quarter weeks ahead of its competitors. 

Net interest income rose 4.4% to $768 million from $734 million a year ago.
The third-quarter and year-earlier results don't reflect $82 million of interest payments owed but not paid by Brazil.
The absence of Brazilian payments reduced Chase's net income for the first nine months by $57 million, compared with a $30 million reduction a year ago. 

Fee and commission income grew a robust 14%, or $80 million, to $350 million for the quarter. 

Net charge-offs of bad loans for the third quarter totaled $310 million, more than doubling the $141 million of a year ago.
Included in the charge-offs were $79 million for real estate loans by Chase Bank of Arizona and $122 million for loans to developing countries.
Net charge-offs of domestic consumer loans rose to $71 million from $53 million, primarily due to higher loan volume levels.
