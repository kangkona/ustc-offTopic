Eclectic Elected] 

Single-subject panel shows 

Are much too cut and dried; 

I like my panel topics 

Diversified. 

They needn't necessarily 

Be brainy, 

Suffice to me if they're 

A miscellany. 

Hodgepodge is my elixir, 

Pastiche is my potion, 

For there you have (don't you agree?) 

Potpourri in motion. 

-- Dow Richardson. 

Take Aim 

The stock market goes up and down.
It follows the tried and true formula of a moving target being hard to hit. 

-- Gil Stern. 

Daffynition 

Assignation expense: tryst funds. 

-- Shannon Rose.
