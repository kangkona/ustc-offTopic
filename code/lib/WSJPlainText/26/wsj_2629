The state of Bavaria is ready to sell its 35.45% interest in tank maker Krauss-Maffei AG, the Bavarian finance minister said. 

Speaking to journalists in Munich, Gerold Tandler also indicated that engineering concern Mannesmann AG is the main candidate to acquire the stake, and perhaps take majority control of the group. 

Mr. Tandler said there have been talks, but no formal negotiations, about the sale of the shares.
Earlier this week, Mannesmann said it is considering taking a stake in Munich-based Krauss-Maffei provided the ownership structure of the latter changed.
