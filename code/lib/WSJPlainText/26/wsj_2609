Bear, Stearns & Co., New York, formed a group to buy the Israeli government's 82% stake in Jerusalem Economic Corp. for $1.70 a share, or $53 million. 

The group plans an offer to buy the rest of Jerusalem Economic's shares, which trade on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, at about the same price. 

Jerusalem Economic, formed by the government and other entities in 1948 to develop industrial buildings in Jerusalem, owns 2.3 million square feet of office and warehouse space around the city.
Jerusalem Economic also has about 360,000 square feet under construction. 

The group includes the securities firm; Uzi Zucker and Carl Glickman, directors of parent Bear, Stearns Cos.; and Eliezer Fishman, a Tel Aviv accountant, real-estate investor and publisher. 

Alan C. Greenberg, chairman and chief executive officer of Bear, Stearns Cos. and its subsidiary, said Israel has "a unique position as a free-trade bridge between Europe and the U.S., which is very attractive to" the firm as an investor.
