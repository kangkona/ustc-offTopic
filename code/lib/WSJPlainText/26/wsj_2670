Michaels Stores Inc. said it expects to ask shareholders to vote early next year on a $12-a-share cash and stock offer to acquire the specialty retailer. 

Previously, Michaels said it hoped to hold a special shareholders meeting this fall.
But the Dallas company said that it took longer than expected to pull materials together and said it just filed preliminary proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

The company, which is 30% owned by the Wyly family, agreed in August to be acquired for $9.50 a share in cash and $2.50 a share in new preferred stock.
The buyers are an investment group that includes Grauer & Wheat Investments Inc. of Dallas and Acadia Partners Limited Partnership of Fort Worth, Texas, a partnership that includes the Robert M. Bass Group.
Michaels has 10.6 million shares outstanding.
