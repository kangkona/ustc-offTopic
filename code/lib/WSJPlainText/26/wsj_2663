The number of Hispanics in the U.S. grew in the 1980s more than five times as fast as the rest of the population, the government reported. 

The Census Bureau said that the nation's Hispanic population numbered 20.1 million as of March 1989, 38.9% greater than in 1980.
The rest of the population grew 7.5% in the same years. 

The bulk of the Hispanics in the U.S.-about six in every 10 -- are of Mexican origin.
About one in 10 is from Puerto Rican roots.
Nearly all the rest come from other Central or South American countries, although the Census Bureau also counts as Hispanics persons from Spain and those who describe themselves as Spanish or Latino. 

Two-thirds of this country's Hispanics live in three states, the bureau added.
California has 34% and Texas has 21%, most of them Mexican.
New York has 10%, most of them Puerto Rican. 

Hispanics now account for about 8.2% of the 243.7 million people living in the U.S.
