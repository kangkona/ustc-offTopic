Canadian housing starts rose 9.6% in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 216,000 from an August rate of 197,000, Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp., a federal agency, said. 

The agency attributed the September increase mainly to a sharp rise in construction of rental and condominium dwellings in the Vancouver and Montreal areas.
