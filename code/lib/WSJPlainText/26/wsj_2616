European airlines' August passenger traffic in Western Europe grew by 7% from a year earlier, according to the Association of European Airlines. 

The rise matched similar rates of growth in July and June, indicating that the rise in passenger traffic for the full year in Europe would be close to 7.5%, the 21-member association said. 

"Such a volume of growth . . . is putting considerable strain on airport and air-traffic-control facilities," the association said in a statement. 

The association said flight delays in Europe eased slightly in August, but it forecast the improvement wouldn't last.
It said 20.7% of short-haul and medium-distance flights were delayed by at least 15 minutes, lower than 28.6% of such flights delayed in July. 

Long-haul passenger traffic rose by 6.2% in August, a stronger growth rate than the rise of 4% in July.
