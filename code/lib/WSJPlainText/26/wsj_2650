Schweizerische Aluminium AG, a Swiss chemical and aluminum group better known as Alusuisse, said its French subsidiary, Alusuisse France S.A., has bought a 40% stake in the French packaging manufacturer Raymond Morin S.A. 

The value of the transaction wasn't disclosed, but the Zurich-based parent of the French unit said, "For the Alusuisse group, this participation is a further step in the strategic development of its packaging business." 

Raymond Morin, the leading supplier in France of flexible packaging to the food industry, had a turnover in 1988 of 350 million French francs ($54.6 million), according to a statement released by Alusuisse.
Raymond Morin, which employs 400 people at its plant in Sarrebourg, France, holds a major share of the French market for packaging of cheese, dairy products, coffee and soups, the statement said.
About 30% of its output is exported to Europe and North America.
