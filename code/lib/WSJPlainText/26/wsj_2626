A House subcommittee approved a measure that would require telephone companies to provide special devices that enable deaf people to use the telephone. 

The House telecommunications and finance subcommittee voted unanimously for the requirement, as part of a broader measure that would ban discrimination against the handicapped in employment, public accommodations, transportation, and communications.
The Commerce Committee panel was the first on the House side to vote on any part of the bill. 

Three other House committees, including the Labor, Judiciary and Public Works panels, are also considering provisions of the bill, which has strong Bush administration support.
The Senate approved its version last month. 

The telephone provision, similar to one contained in the Senate measure, would give phone companies three years to provide relay systems permitting linkups between deaf persons and telephone voice conversations.
Simple computers would allow deaf callers to use a keyboard to send messages to an operator, who would then relay them by spoken or similar teletype message to another person.
The operator also could relay telephone voice messages by teletype to a deaf person. 

The bill would allow telephone companies to recover costs of the service through general rate making, but would prohibit monthly surcharges for all phone users in interstate service.
Deaf users couldn't be forced to bear the full cost.
The service is estimated to add three cents a month to residential phones rates.
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. generally supports the measure; it provides such service in Alabama, California and New York, and has a similar plan for Illinois.
