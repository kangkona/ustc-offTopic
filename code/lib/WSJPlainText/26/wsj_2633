Thursdays, Oct. 12-Nov. 30, 9-10 p.m. EDT (and EST), on PBS (PBS air dates and times vary, so check local listings): "Campion." "Mystery]" introduces yet another blue-blooded sleuth, Albert Campion (Peter Davison), created by yet another lady crime novelist, Margery Allingham.
Too bad the characters' tweeds speak louder than their words -- due to their strong accents and to the poor sound recording typical of British productions.

Meanwhile, back in the Old West, Harry Carey Jr., Jimmy Stewart and others recall the happy days of making classic Westerns with Mr. Ford, in this combination of home movies and hot air.

Sunday, Oct. 15, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "And a Nightingale Sang." If you're willing to tolerate the sappy beginning of this new "Masterpiece Theatre" film about a working-class British family muddling through World War II, you'll be rewarded by its wry humor and bittersweet ending.

Monday, Oct. 16, 8-10 p.m. EDT, on TNT cable (repeated at 10 p.m. and midnight; as well as Oct. 17, 22, 26 and Nov. 12): "Cold Sassy Tree." In the third outstanding production from TNT, Faye Dunaway is superb as a beautiful stranger who scandalizes a turn-of-the-century Georgia town by marrying the newly widowed proprietor of its general store.
Equally good are Richard Widmark as her white-haired beau, and Neil Patrick Harris as his clear-eyed grandson. 

Monday, Oct. 16, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on NBC: "Roxanne: The Prize Pulitzer." Scandal has come a long way since the turn of the century, as evidenced by this lurid but pathetic tale of the self-indulgent, miserable marriage and divorce of Roxanne Dixon and publishing heir Herbert Pulitzer. 

Wednesday, Oct. 18, 9-10:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "The Eighth Van Cliburn International Piano Competition: Here to Make Music."

Thursday, Oct. 19, 9-11:30 p.m. EDT, on A&E (repeated Oct. 22): "La Boheme." Now making its TV debut, this production starring Luciano Pavarotti and Mirella Freni was taped at the San Francisco Opera House last winter. 

Sundays, Oct. 22 and 29, 9-10 p.m. EDT (and EST), on PBS: "Precious Bane." Even in the late 19th century, there were parts of rural England untouched by modernity -- as evidenced in this eerie tale of passion and superstition in a tiny Shropshire village.

Tuesdays, Oct. 24-Nov. 28, 10-11 p.m. EDT (and EST), on PBS (Mondays, Oct. 23-Nov. 27, 8-9 p.m. on WNYC; 10-11 p.m. on WNET): "America's Century." Good news for loyal readers of Lewis Lapham.
