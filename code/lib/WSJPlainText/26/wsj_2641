Max & Erma's Restaurants Inc. said it completed the sale of 520,000 shares of its common stock for about $2.9 million. 

The stock was sold to holders of common stock purchase warrants that expired Oct. 7, the restaurant operator said. 

With the sale, the company has slightly more than three million common shares outstanding. 

The bulk of the proceeds will be invested and used to fund growth beyond 1990, the company said.
