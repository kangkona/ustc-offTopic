T Cell Sciences Inc. said the Food and Drug Administration approved for marketing its Cell-free hairy cell leukemia test. 

The Cambridge, Mass., biotechnology concern said the test is used to evaluate and monitor patients' responses to treatments of the blood-cell cancer.
T Cell said it plans later to seek FDA approval to market the test for detecting organ transplant rejection and for monitoring rheumatoid arthritis. 

The company said the FDA approval was the first for a test based on measurement of blood levels of immune system proteins called T cell receptors.
