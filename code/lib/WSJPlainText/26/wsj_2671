West German corporate insolvencies rose 4.8% in August from a year earlier to a total of 790 companies, although the number of bankruptcies in the first eight months of the year was still 9.5% below the year earlier, the Federal Statistics Office said. 

The agency said that the number of corporate bankruptcies climbed in August from the double-digit decline recorded in the first half of the year primarily because of a higher number of bankruptcies among service and transportation companies.
