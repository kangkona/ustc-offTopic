Societe Generale de Belgique SA (SGB), Belgium's largest holding company, increased its stake in its banking affiliate, Generale de Banque, to nearly 20%, a spokesman for SGB said. 

That is up from a holding of 13% at year end 1988. 

The spokesman confirmed a report in the Belgian financial daily De Tijd that the holding company recently had bought a 5% block of Generale de Banque shares sold by Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV (Amro). 

The spokesman said SGB's holding in Generale de Banque now amounts to 19.44%. 

Amro and Generale de Banque announced they would reduce their 10% cross-shareholdings by half after merger talks between the two broke down in September. 

The SGB spokesman didn't say at what price the Generale de Belgique shares were bought.
