Birmingham Steel Corp. and two partners in a steelmaking joint venture said they signed a letter of intent to purchase land and an idle melt shop in Houston from Armco Inc., Parsippany, N.J. 

Birmingham and its partners said they plan to spend about $260 million to develop the mini-mill joint venture, which is expected to have annual production capacity of 1.2 million tons of flat rolled steel. 

The latest joint venture proposal follows the cancellation of a plan by Birmingham, Proler International Corp., and Danieli & Co. to purchase certain land and melt shop facilities from Cameron Forge Co.
The reason that proposal collapsed wasn't disclosed. 

Birmingham is a steelmaker based in Birmingham, Ala.
Proler is a scrap recycler and processor based in Houston.
Danieli of Italy supplies capital equipment and engineering services to the steel industry.
