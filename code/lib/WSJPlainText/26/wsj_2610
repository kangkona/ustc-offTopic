Pratt & Whitney, Hartford, Conn., said Japan Air System Co. ordered 16 of its JT8D-200 jet engines and acquired options on four others, in a transaction that has a potential value of $80 million. 

Japan Air, Tokyo, will use the engines to power McDonnell Douglas Corp. MD-81 twin-jets it has ordered.
Engine deliveries are scheduled for 1994 through 1996, Pratt & Whitney said. 

The engine maker is a unit of United Technologies Corp., which has interests in making helicopters, elevators, and defense and industrial products. 

Japan Air, a regional carrier, recently changed its name from Toa Domestic Airlines.
