Dalgety PLC, a British food and agricultural products company, said it has exited food commodities trading with the sale of its Gill & Duffus unit for #87.4 million ($135.9 million). 

Gill & Duffus, which Dalgety acquired in 1985, was sold off in four parts to a combination of management and outside investors.
Dalgety didn't disclose individual proceeds of the sale. 

Maurice Warren, Dalgety's managing director, said the company sold its Gill & Duffus trading units to focus on downstream operations in food manufacturing and agribusiness. 

He added that the move was largely a response to unpredictable earnings from the highly volatile and cyclical commodity markets, which had eroded returns from Gill & Duffus during the five years that Dalgety controlled the international trading and brokerage company.
