Daimler-Benz AG said it expects to reach an agreement by Oct. 20 with the states of Hamburg and Bremen on the terms for its acquisition of a majority stake in Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.

A spokesman for the West German automobile and technology company said the company expects all the open questions involving the north German states that own stakes in MBB will be answered by that point.
MBB owners will be meeting in Munich on Oct. 20.
Daimler said a vote on the MBB acquisition will be on the agenda for that meeting. 

Daimler-Benz has won approval from the Economics Ministry to acquire 50.01% of MBB for about 1.7 billion marks ($892 million), but has met resistance from Hamburg and Bremen, two northern German city states, which fear a loss of jobs as a result of the takeover. 

The opposition from Hamburg and Bremen has threatened to delay the takeover of MBB, which Daimler's Chairman Edzard Reuter said he wants to complete before year end.
Currently, Hamburg owns 18.2% of MBB and Bremen holds 10%.
