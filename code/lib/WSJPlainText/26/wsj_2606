Katherine Graham, chairman and chief executive officer of Washington Post Co., has agreed to write her memoirs for Alfred A. Knopf Inc.
The publisher declined to disclose the price it will pay and said a publication date hasn't been set. 

Knopf said that Robert Bernstein, chairman of Random House Inc., whose imprints include Knopf, has been trying for several years to persuade Ms. Graham to write her memoirs. 

Ms. Graham, who is 72 years old, is one of the most powerful women in the media and one of a handful of female chief executives at Fortune 500 corporations.
Her father, originally a banker, bought the Washington Post in 1933 and Ms. Graham worked for the family publishing business for years before being named president in 1963. 

Ms. Graham is writing the book herself, a Knopf spokesman said, and has already turned in a portion of the manuscript to editor Elisabeth Sifton. 

Autobiographies of media barons aren't automatic bestsellers, and Ms. Graham may find that Allen Neuharth, recently retired chairman of Gannett Co., is a hard act to follow.
The official publication date of Mr. Neuharth's autobiography, "Confessions of an S.O.B.," is today, but the book has already sold enough copies to land on the New York Times' hard-cover, non-fiction bestseller list.
