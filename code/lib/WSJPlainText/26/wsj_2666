Beverly Enterprises Inc., Pasadena, Calif., agreed in principle to sell 18 nursing homes in the Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minn., area for $32 million to a group of private investors. 

The investors have retained Health Dimensions Inc. of Cambridge, Minn. to manage the facilities.
Of the $32 million sale price, $14 million will be paid to Nationwide Health Properties Inc., a real estate investment trust located here that owns health care facilities and leases them to various parties, including Beverly.
Four of the nursing homes included in the proposed sale are owned by Nationwide Health and leased to Beverly. 

Funds from the proposed sale will be used to reduce Beverly's bank debt.
The company's total debt outstanding at the end of August was about $540 million.
The sale is part of a continuing divestiture program under which Beverly, an operator of nursing homes, pharmacies and home health centers, will sell more than 300 nursing homes in several states.
