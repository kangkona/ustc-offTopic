The Food and Drug Administration asked the microwave food-packaging industry to demonstrate the safety of metalized containers used to brown foods at extremely high temperatures. 

The request for scientific data is the agency's first step toward setting standards for high-temperature microwave packaging.
It also reflects increasing FDA concern that materials in packages with metalized surfaces, called heat susceptors, could be transferred to foods at the high temperatures needed to brown foods or make them crispy. 

Heat susceptors are used in microwave packaging for such foods as popcorn, pizza, fish sticks and french fries, according to the FDA. 

An FDA spokesman said materials used for microwave packages may comply with existing regulations written for temperatures below 300 degrees Fahrenheit.
But when those regulations were written, he said, the agency didn't envision food being browned at temperatures up to 500 degrees. 

The FDA is particularly concerned that adhesives, polymers and metallic components in the heat susceptors could spread to foods at high temperatures. 

The agency's call for research information by Dec. 7 stems from a September 1988 meeting with the National Food Processors Association, a trade group that represents microwave food processors and microwave packaging manufacturers.
