SLHD Inc., Boston, citing environmental cleanup costs, lowered its estimate of a liquidation distribution to shareholders to $1 to $1.25 a share. 

The company, a footwear maker formerly known as Sporto Corp., has been trying to liquidate in the wake of continuing losses.
It earlier estimated that shareholders would receive $1.65 to $1.90 a share after the sale of its assets. 

SLHD said it lowered its estimate of the distribution following the discovery of cleaning-fluid contamination at its facility in Jasper, Ga.
Cleaning up the chemical has delayed the sale of the facility and resulted in unexpected costs.
The company also said, "sales of inventory generated less than had been anticipated."
