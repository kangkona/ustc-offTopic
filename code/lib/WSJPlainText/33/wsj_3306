Fedders Corp. expects net income for 1989 will exceed the year earlier's $21.9 million, or $1.38 a share, which included $7 million of tax benefits, said Sal Giordano Jr., vice chairman and chief executive officer. 

Speaking to securities analysts here, Mr. Giordano said 1989 sales should reach $370 million, up 67% from 1988's $221.1 million. 

The Peapack, N.J., maker of room air conditioners expects to report third-quarter sales advanced about 75% from the year-earlier period, to about $60 million, the executive said.
The third quarter is the slowest of the year for Fedders. 

Assuming normal weather conditions and excluding acquisitions, Fedders expects full-year 1990 sales to grow at least 12% from 1989, to more than $415 million.
Fedders is "comfortable" with the more modest 1990 growth, having tripled sales in the past two years, Mr. Giordano said. 

Regarding Rotorex, the maker of rotary compressors that Fedders acquired in June, Mr. Giordano said the company doesn't expect it to help gross-profit margins until 1990.
But "strong cash flow" has allowed Fedders to pay down $32 million, as of Sept. 30, of the $41 million it borrowed to acquire Rotorex. 

In the past year, the company has completed three acquisitions for a total of $118 million and has supplied working capital to double output at two of the facilities. 

At Sept. 30, Fedders had no short-term debt, and long-term debt was around $53 million at an average interest rate of 9.3%, leaving "ample borrowing capacity," the executive said. 

Fedders's North American market share should grow to about 30% at year's end from 20% last year, Mr. Giordano said.
Direct sales now constitute 64% of sales with distributors accounting for 36%, reversing the percentages Fedders posted for 1984.
