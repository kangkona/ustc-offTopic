Snap-On Tools Corp. said it will report a 10% to 15% drop in third-quarter net income, because of a slowdown in sales through its independent dealer network. 

For last year's third quarter, the hand-tool maker reported net income of $27.2 million, or 65 cents a share. 

Sales for the quarter ended last month were slightly higher than the 1988 quarter's $208.9 million.
