Thanks to takeovers, Wall Street is pocketing more than ever in investment banking fees from corporate America, new figures show. 

Investment banking fees paid by the typical U.S. industrial company rose 28% to $5.6 million in the past 12 months, according to Greenwich Associates, a Greenwich, Conn.-based research firm. 

Of the total, merger and acquisition services cost $2.7 million for the average industrial concern, up $1 million, or 59%, from a year earlier, the firm said.
Fees for other investment banking services averaged $2.9 million in the latest 12 months, up less than 12%. 

The findings, obtained in 1,260 interviews with officials of the country's biggest industrial, utility and financial companies, "confirms that the m&a (mergers and acquisition) business continues its importance as the driving source of profitability for these investment banks," said James A. Bennett, Greenwich Associates vice president. 

Investment banking fees paid in several giant deals, such the takeover fight surrounding the record $25 billion buy-out of RJR Nabisco Inc. a year ago, inflated the statistics for merger services, according to Mr. Bennett.
Still, while the biggest companies incur the biggest fees, the survey found that merger charges were growing the fastest for companies ranked below 300 on the Fortune 500 list. 

Merger fees paid by three categories of companies -- utilities, bank holding companies and thrift institutions -- declined in the latest 12 months, Greenwich Associates said.
