Maxus Energy Corp. said it sold a 10% interest in a production-sharing contract in Indonesia to Repsol Exploracion S.A. of Spain for about $100 million. 

The oil and gas concern said the sale lowered its interest in the contract to 24.3% from 34.3%, while increasing Repsol's interest to 12.45%.
Repsol is an energy exploration concern. 

Maxus said the sale is subject to final approval by Pertamina, the Indonesian oil company, and the Indonesian government. 

"This sale allows us to retain a sizable interest in the Northwest Java contract area, while increasing our financial flexibility," said Charles Blackburn, chairman and chief executive of Maxus.
