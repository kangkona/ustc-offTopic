Rosewood Financial Partners, tightening the screws on First Executive Corp. 's management, said it filed with federal antitrust regulators for clearance to buy up to 49.9% of the insurance holding company's common stock. 

The move, detailed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, raises the question of whether Rosewood, a Dallas investment partnership controlled by a trust of oil heiress Caroline Rose Hunt, is gearing up for a takeover fight.
Also in the SEC filing, Rosewood disclosed that it boosted its stake in Los Angeles-based First Executive to 9.95% from 9.6%. 

In earlier statements, Rosewood has denied any takeover interest, saying it merely wants more influence in the company to enhance shareholder values.
The latest filing doesn't mention the partnership's intentions, and a Rosewood spokesman declined to comment.
