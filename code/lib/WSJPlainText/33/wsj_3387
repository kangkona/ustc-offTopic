Summcorp, Fort Wayne, Ind., said the addition of $4.5 million to its provision for possible loan losses will cause it to "fall short" of its goal of exceeding the 1988 third-quarter and full-year results. 

The bank-holding company said it expects to report earnings for the third quarter "in the range of 42 cents to 44 cents a share," compared with year-earlier net income of $4.9 million, or 56 cents a share. 

For the year, Summcorp said it expects earnings of $2 to $2.06 a share, compared with $19.3 million, or $2.20 a share, in 1988. 

The company said the provision, which will equal $2.9 million, or 33 cents a share, after taxes, will be in addition to its normal quarterly loan-loss provision of $1,950,000. 

Summcorp said the increase in reserves was caused by the rapid deterioration of two loans in its Fort Wayne bank.
