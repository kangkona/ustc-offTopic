Stocks' rally slowed, but the market's blue-chip indicator managed to set another record, and airline issues soared after AMR emerged as the industry's latest takeover target. 

Prices drifted within narrow ranges throughout the session and were little changed at the close.
But the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended at its third consecutive record high, up 2.47 to 2773.56 with the help of rallies in Philip Morris and Chevron. 

Broader averages were mixed.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.03 to 356.97, the Dow Jones Equity Market Index rose 0.18 to 335.02, and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 0.07 to 198.05. 

But the Dow Jones Transportation Average posted its sharpest advance in about two months as New York investor Donald Trump weighed in with an offer for AMR, the parent company of American Airlines. 

The average jumped 31.65 to 1498.76 even though airline issues pulled back in late trading on news that the Senate Commerce Committee voted to give the federal Department of Transportation power of prior approval over airline mergers. 

News of Mr. Trump's interest in AMR, which had been rumored for weeks, sparked a revival of buying in several other issues surrounded by takeover or restructuring speculation. 

Even so, Big Board volume fell to 177,890,000 shares from 194,590,000 Wednesday.
Some traders said institutional investors were more reluctant to step into the market than they had been earlier in the week when prices were rising. 

"I haven't seen institutions in here wildly buying, but they're certainly asking a lot of questions," said Jeff Kaminsky, head of institutional sales trading at Mabon, Nugent & Co. "You can certainly get their attention now." 

Prices slipped in the final hour on profit-taking and a brief round of futures-related sell programs, but the market held its ground and firmed at the close. 

Analysts attributed the lack of direction partly to uncertainty about the effects of a round of interest rate increases in West Germany and several other European countries.
The increases were aimed in part at keeping the dollar in check, but the currency rebounded after an initial drop and stood higher late in the day. 

Suresh L. Bhirud, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co., said higher rates will tend to slow the world economy and could bring a drop in exports and further pressure on corporate profits. 

"That is something the stock market will have to think about, since corporate profits are already weak as it is," Mr. Bhirud said.
He said the rate increases constitute a "new roadblock" for any attempt by stocks to move higher. 

Advancing and declining stocks were almost even on the Big Board, with 741 issues advancing and 743 declining. 

AMR, the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, soared 16 7/8 to 99 7/8 on composite trading of 8.4 million shares.
But the closing price was still well below the $120 a share offered by Mr. Trump. 

Several arbitragers told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report Mr. Trump will have to obtain financing for the offer or take other action to build its credibility -- such as finding a partner or making specific plans to incorporate his East Coast airline shuttle into AMR -- before they would buy the stock. 

"It's possible he's for real, but if he was serious, he'd launch a fully financed tender offer," one arbitrager said.
Previously, Mr. Trump has bought stakes in several companies, disclosed his positions and then sold the shares without making any bid. 

In addition, news reports said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) wants the Commerce Committee's bill on airline mergers worded so that Mr. Trump's bid would be subject to the new regulations. 

Despite that, the Trump offer boosted stocks of other airlines that haven't already received bids.
Delta Air Lines surged 3 1/2 to 78 1/4, USAir Group rose 1 to 48 3/4, Southwest Airlines rose 1/4 to 26 3/4, and Pan Am climbed 1/2 to 4 1/8 on about four million shares. 

But UAL, the owner of United Airlines, went down 1 1/4 to 281 1/2.
The machinists' union at United refused to support the leveraged buy-out offer of $300 a share made by UAL management, United's pilots and British Airways. 

While the airlines showed renewed vigor, selected technology issues extended a rebound that began Wednesday.
Compaq Computer climbed 3 5/8 to 94 1/8, Digital Equipment advanced 1 3/4 to 91 1/4, and Hewlett-Packard rose 1 to 50.

The stock went up 1 7/8 to 64 3/4, and 1.9 million shares changed hands.
Elsewhere in the oil sector, Burlington Resourcesrose 3/4 to 50 1/8 in active trading as takeover rumors continued to swirl around the stock.

Paramount Communications surged 3 3/4 to 62 on 1.8 million shares.
