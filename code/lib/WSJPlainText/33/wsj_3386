Lee Data Corp., citing slack demand for its products, said it expects to report a loss of $17 million to $18 million, or $1.38 a share to $1.46 a share, and a 34% revenue decline, for its fiscal second quarter ended Oct. 1. 

In the year-earlier quarter, the Minneapolis data-communications system maker had a loss of $750,000 on revenue of $21.4 million.
Lee said revenue for the quarter just ended was about $16 million.
The company has about 12,325,000 shares outstanding. 

Lee stock plunged 62.5 cents yesterday to close at $1.50 a share, in national over-the-counter trading. 

Lee also said that it was cutting its 913-person work force by 190 immediately, to reduce costs.
Total staff cuts will reach 260 by the end of the company's fiscal year in March, the company said. 

Lee said it will take nonrecurring charges of $11 million to $12 million in the quarter, including about $3 million for restructuring and severance expenses, and about $8 million mainly for inventory and equipment write-downs.
