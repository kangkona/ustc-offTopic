William V. Roberti, 42 years old, was named chief executive officer of Brooks Brothers. 

He succeeds Frank T. Reilly, 62, who plans to retire as chairman and chief executive officer of the men's clothier Dec. 31.
The move for Mr. Reilly, who has been chief executive since 1974, is a "true retirement, a planned retirement," a spokesman said.
Mr. Reilly didn't disclose his post-retirement plans. 

Mr. Reilly started at Brooks Brothers as a buyer in 1952 and moved on to Saks Fifth Avenue, now a unit of B.A.T Industries PLC, and later became president of Wallachs, a division of Hartmarx Corp., before returning to Brooks Brothers. 

Under Mr. Reilly, the company expanded to 52 stores from 15.
It also expanded into Japan.
Brooks Brothers has been a unit of London-based Marks & Spencer PLC since April 1988. 

The chairman's post won't be filled.
Mr. Roberti, who remains president, is succeeded as chief operating officer by Edward T. Murphy, 46, the company's executive vice president.
