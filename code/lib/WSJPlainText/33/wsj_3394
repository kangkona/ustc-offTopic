Bargain-hunters turned their attention to the over-the-counter market, which has trailed the New York Stock Exchange's big gains this week. 

As of Wednesday's close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 2.9% this week, while the Big Board composite index was up about 2.1%.
But the Nasdaq Composite Index had risen only 1.14%, though it closed at a record each day. 

Yesterday, however, "We finally caught up," said Robert Antolini, head of over-the-counter trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.34, or about 0.3%, to 480.66, another record.
The Dow Jones industrials, meanwhile, rose only 0.09%, and the Big Board composite index was up 0.07%. 

There were 999 OTC issues rising in price and 946 falling.
Nasdaq volume receded to 151,092,000 shares from 164,357,000 Wednesday. 

Mr. Antolini said the moves in listed stock prices this week had made those shares too expensive for investors who still had money to spend.
That sent buyers shopping for lagging unlisted issues, he said. 

The buyers focused on many of the over-the-counter market's technology stocks.
The group, which began recovering Wednesday, posted further gains yesterday. 

Microsoft led the group higher for the second day.
The software giant, the fourth largest over-the-counter issue in terms of market capitalization, gained 3 3/4 to 79 1/4 on heavy volume. 

Apple Computer jumped 1 1/4 to 45 1/2 on volume of 2.1 million shares, and Sun Microsystems rose 3/4 to 18 on 3.3 million shares. 

Intel gained 1/2 to 33 despite announcing it will take a $35 million charge against third-quarter pretax earnings.
The charge will cover costs incurred in seeking a buyer for its BiiN joint venture with West Germany's Siemens. 

The biggest over-the-counter issue, MCI Communications, rose 1/8 to 45 7/8.
Traders said MCI's stock price had kept pace with the market previously, so it didn't attract the bargain-hunters that bought technology shares yesterday. 

Outrunning all others on the active list was Jaguar.
More than 5.2 million of the company's American depository receipts changed hands as the price jumped 1 3/8 to 11 5/8.
Speculation increased yesterday that a bidding war would erupt between General Motors and Ford Motor for a stake in the European luxury car-maker. 

Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton's ADRs gained 3 1/4 to 153 after the company said its first-half profit surged 60%. 

First Constitution Financial jumped 4 1/8 to 20 1/8 after agreeing to be acquired for $25 a share.
The agreement was made with WFRR L.P. and GHKM.
The bank holding company also said it will report a loss of more than $10 million for the third quarter after a $27 million provision for real estate loan losses. 

Invacare slid 2 5/8 to 10.
Lower-than-expected sales and a restructuring charge will result in the company just breaking even in the third quarter, Invacare said.
It had net income of 31 cents a share a year earlier. 

First Executive rose 1 3/8 to 12 5/8.
Rosewood Partners took another step toward its goal of acquiring a major stake in the company.
In a filing with federal regulators, Rosewood asked for antitrust clearance to buy as much as 49.9%.
Last week, Rosewood disclosed that it wanted to buy the 20% stake in First Executive now held by I.C.H.
That stake is subject to a stand-still agreement between I.C.H. and First Executive, which Rosewood has asked to be waived. 

In yesterday's filing, Rosewood said it recently bought 300,000 First Executive shares in the open market, adding to the 9.2% stake it already owned. 

Lee Data lost 5/8 to 1 1/2 after announcing that it will report a loss of as much as $18 million for its second quarter, which ended Sunday, after charges of as much as $12 million for restructuring expenses, write-downs and other costs.
The company also said it is cutting its work force by 190, with additional reductions planned over the next six months.
