Not long ago luxury-car makers were fighting to see who could have the highest prices.
Now the battle is heading in the opposite direction. 

Bayerische Motoren Werke AG yesterday said it's freezing or cutting prices on its entire U.S. 1990 model line.
BMW of North America Inc. also is sending owners of some of its vehicles certificates offering additional discounts if they purchase a new BMW anytime in the next three years. 

Shortly after the BMW announcement, Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. said it's raising base prices of its 1990 U.S. models by a relatively modest average of 2.2%.
The importer of cars made by Daimler-Benz AG said it is attempting to hold the line on some vehicle prices by including as standard some previously optional equipment at no additional cost. 

The unusual moves come at a time when competition in the luxury-car market is reaching a new pitch.
Chrysler Corp. is introducing its new Imperial luxury car and Ford Motor Co. has completely redesigned the exterior of its Lincoln Town Car.
Lexus cars from Toyota Motor Corp. went on sale in August and products from Nissan Motor Co. 's Infiniti Division make their debut next month.
Jaguar PLC recently introduced a new "base" XJ6 model with less equipment and a lower price than the least expensive 1989 XJ6.
Porsche Cars of North America Inc. said in August it wouldn't raise prices of its 1990 models from 1989 levels. 

"The luxury performance market is more competitive.
The economic environment has changed, and the competition has changed," Karl Gerlinger, the new president of BMW's U.S. operations, said at a news conference. "We take {that} competition -- whether it's from Japan, Germany or the U.S. -- very seriously." 

BMW said it decided to hold or cut prices rather than resort to rebates or other special incentives because such programs "erode value." So the company's 300 series cars will continue to range from $24,650 for the 325i two-door to $34,950 for the M3 sports car. 

The 525i now will start at $35,000 compared with $37,000; the 535i will start at $41,500 instead of $43,600.
The base price of the 735i falls to $49,000 from $54,000 while the 735iL starts at $53,000, down 8.6% from $58,000.
The $70,000 base price of the 750iL remains the same. 

To soften bruised feelings among those who paid last year's higher prices for 5-series and 7-series models, BMW is sending the certificates, good for half the price cut, to customers who bought those cars between January 1988 and September 1989.
The coupons will go out as part of a one-million-letter direct mail campaign, said Carl W. Flesher, Jr., vice president of BMW's U.S. marketing group. 

As previously reported, BMW also will bring out next May a new, less-expensive, "entry-level" model, the 318is, for around $22,000. 

Mercedes-Benz raised the price of its least expensive model, the 190E 2.6 with manual transmission, by only $10 to $31,600.
It also froze the price of the 190E 2.6 with automatic transmission at $32,500, despite adding electrically adjustable front seats, which were a $950 option on the 1989 model. 

Prices on the remainder of Mercedes-Benz's U.S. line now will range from $39,950 for the 300E 2.6 with automatic transmission to $83,500 for the 500SL two-seat convertible, which is new this year.
In 1989, the range was from $39,200 to $79,840.
