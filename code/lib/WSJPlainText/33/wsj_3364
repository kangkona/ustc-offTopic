A senior Treasury official warned commercial banks that the pending debt settlement for Mexico is the best arrangement they can get, and he warned them against hanging back from participating in it. 

Some U.S. and European bankers have argued that the proposed settlement doesn't include sufficient enhancements -- government and international agency funds, assurances and guarantees -- to compensate them for losses they have to take if they opt to offer Mexico cuts in its debt or interest payments. 

"If it doesn't come together, the deal will have to be recut, but not with more enhancements," warned the official, who predicted that the agreement will be completed.
He said revising the agreement "would be very painful to the banks." 

In separate interviews, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and the Treasury official also underscored the need for some banks to continue lending to Mexico.
The proposed agreement gives banks the option of cutting debt or interest payments or providing new loans.
In recent weeks, there has been increasing concern that few banks will offer to lend further funds. 

"We want the banks to remain in Mexico; we don't want all the banks out," Mr. Salinas said in a meeting with this newspaper.
Mexico currently has hundreds of foreign bank creditors, and that is too many, he said.
But he added, "We want at least two Japanese banks, at least three American banks and at least one German bank to stay in." 

The Treasury official played down concerns about the recent decision by some big U.S. banks to add substantial sums to their provisions for shaky loans.
In recent weeks, J.P. Morgan & Co., Chase Manhattan Corp. and Manufacturers Hanover Corp. all have added to their loan-loss reserves, fueling fears that they won't lend more to Mexico. 

"The reserving action by U.S. banks is mostly a neutral action," the Treasury official said. "For some banks it has actually increased their chances of doing new money."
