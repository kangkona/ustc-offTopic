McDonnell Douglas Corp. 's Douglas Aircraft Co. unit said Japan Air System Co. placed orders for eight MD-81 jetliners, and took options on two more. 

The eight firm orders have an indicated total value of more than $245 million, based on the $30.7 million average cost of each of the twinjets.
The planes are set to be delivered between 1994 and 1996. 

The Tokyo-based airline, which last year changed its name from Toa Domestic Airlines Co., said it plans to use the new aircraft primarily for domestic flights.
The airline currently has 11 other MD-80-series aircraft on order for delivery between 1990 and 1992.
The order brings the total Douglas aircraft ordered by Japan Air System over the years to 60. 

Douglas said that as of Wednesday, total orders and other commitments for the MD-80 program were 1,573, of which 649 had been delivered. 

Stock in St. Louis-based McDonnell closed unchanged yesterday at $70.50 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
