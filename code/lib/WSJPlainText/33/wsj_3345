The Machinists union, on strike for the second day against Boeing Co., said it contacted the aircraft maker and indicated a willingness to get back to the bargaining table as soon as possible. 

Tom Baker, president of union District 751, which represents nearly 80% of the 55,000 Boeing rank-and-file workers in the walkout, said in an interview that he informed Boeing yesterday, "We're ready to negotiate, day or night." 

But a Boeing spokesman said, "There has been no decision here" as to when the labor talks might resume.
And Mr. Baker added that he didn't expect the company to rush into any settlement discussions. "They're probably going to sit back and see how tough we really are," he said. 

The union, according to Mr. Baker, has a strike fund approaching $100 million, out of which members will be paid $100 a week after the third week of the work stoppage. 

Thus, he contended, the union is prepared for the long haul. "If the company wants to play mind games, it's just going to delay when those airplanes get out," he said. "And I don't think their customers are going to be too happy about that." 

Federal mediator Doug Hammond confirmed late yesterday afternoon that no talks had been scheduled between the company and union. "It's just a matter of when the timing is right," he said.
