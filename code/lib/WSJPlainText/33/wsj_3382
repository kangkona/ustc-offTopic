Environmental Systems Co., Little Rock, Ark., said that a Brambles Industries Ltd. unit sued it in Delaware Chancery Court, asking to inspect certain books and records. 

Environmental Systems, a hazardous-waste management concern, in July rejected an offer from Brambles to acquire the 79% of the company it doesn't already own for $14 a share, or $170.8 million. 

In addition to the stock it owns, Brambles, an Australian transportation and waste management company, owns warrants that, if exercised, would give it 33% of Environmental Systems. 

Officials of Environmental Systems couldn't be reached for comment.
