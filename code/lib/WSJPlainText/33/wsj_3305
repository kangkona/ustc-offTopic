A sharp drop in exports helped Taiwan's monthly trade surplus drop in September, a government agency said. 

Official figures showed that the trade surplus fell to $1.02 billion in September from August's $1.44 billion.
The September surplus, however, represented a growth of 14% from the year-earlier period. 

September exports totaled $5.22 billion, down from $5.94 billion the previous month.
Imports fell to $4.2 billion from August's $4.5 billion. 

Taiwan's trade surplus totaled $10.42 billion for the first nine months of the year, up 37% from a year earlier.
Exports totaled $49.67 billion between January and September, up 11%, and imports rose 6% to $39.25 billion.
