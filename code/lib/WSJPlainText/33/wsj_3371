Magna International Inc., an auto parts manufacturer plagued by overcapacity and high spending, cut its quarterly dividend in half to six Canadian cents (5.1 U.S. cents). 

Magna reported increased net income yesterday for the year ended July 31, but the profit included large one-time gains.
Magna said in a statement that its heavy capital spending has "resulted in lower profits for the time being." 

Magna said net income rose to C$33.6 million (US$28.6 million), or C$1.21 a share for the fiscal year, from C$19.5 million, or 70 Canadian cents, a year earlier.
Sales rose to C$1.92 billion from C$1.46 billion.
But 1989 profit included a pretax gain of C$42.2 million, mostly from the sale of real estate. 

Analysts say the dividend cut and earnings troubles largely come from the company's cash flow problems, high capital spending and large number of plants just as the auto industry enters a slump.
Magna said it spent more than C$1 billion on new facilities and equipment during the past three years.
Capacity utilization averaged only 50% in 1988. 

Magna announced the dividend cut and reported its earnings after the close of trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, where its Class A shares gained 12.5 Canadian cents to C$9.375 on low volume.
Wednesday, the stock closed at C$9.25, a 52-week low.
