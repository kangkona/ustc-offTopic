Les Payne, assistant managing editor of Long Island-based Newsday, as quoted in a Washington Times story on unhappiness among blacks about press coverage of crime: 

The root of the problem starts with police reporting.
Black and white reporters often view the police differently.
In general, blacks come from a group that sees itself as being disproportionately a victim of the police.
For the white reporter, police are not hostile figures.
It starts there, and then expands very rapidly upward, from reporter to editor to newspaper publisher -- all of whom trust the local police.
