South Carolina Federal Corp., Columbia, S.C., and Cooper River Federal Savings Bank of North Charleston said they extended the date for signing a definitive merger agreement until Jan. 4, 1990.
The institutions said they must first concentrate on helping their customers cope with damages suffered from Hurricane Hugo. 

Under terms of the agreement, Cooper River Federal will convert from a mutual to a stock form of organization, while simultaneously merging into South Carolina Federal Savings Bank, a subsidiary of South Carolina Federal Corp., the companies said.
South Carolina Federal Savings Bank will be the surviving entity.
