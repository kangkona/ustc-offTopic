New car sales in Britain fell 10% to 171,730 in September from 191,121 in the same month a year ago, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders Ltd. said. 

The sales, as measured by new car registrations, also were down on the record 500,112 units sold in August, traditionally the peak of the British car-sales season. 

The share of imports in the latest month rose to 60%, or 102,929 units, from 54% a year ago.
The import levels include sales of cars imported by companies that also have U.K.-based production.
