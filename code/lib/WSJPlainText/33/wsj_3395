Bond prices surged on the strength of the dollar, which climbed on foreign exchange markets despite a sharp rise in foreign interest rates. 

As expected, West Germany's Bundesbank raised the Lombard rate and discount rates one percentage point to 8% and 6%, respectively.
The discount rate is the cheapest form of bank refinancing and the Lombard rate is the effective ceiling on overnight loans.
The West German central bank said the rate hikes were needed to cool the nation's "exuberant" economy and to combat inflation. 

The Bundesbank move triggered a round of rate hikes throughout Europe as central banks in France, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands and Belgium all tightened credit conditions.
England's central bank signaled a rise in interest rates, causing Barclays Bank PLC and other large commercial banks to raise their base lending rates to 15% from 14%. 

In early U.S. trading, Treasury prices dropped sharply due to what Brian Fabbri, economist at Midland Montagu Securities Inc., called a "knee-jerk" reaction.
He said investors seemed convinced that higher rates would cut the dollar's strength and that "would be bad for bond." 

But the dollar rebounded instead, and bonds followed suit.
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended one point higher, or up about $10 for each $1,000 face amount.
The issue's yield fell to 8.07% from 8.16%. 

Trading activity was dominated by dealers and professional traders, many of whom were rushing to cover money-losing short positions.
The market's thin trading conditions exaggerated the uptrend. 

"Dealers got twisted around," said Joel Kazis, manager of trading at Smith Barney Harris Upham & Co. Bond trader were overwhelming bearish prior to yesterday and many "took on shorts, expecting prices to fall." 

In a short sale, dealers sell borrowed securities and later seek to make a profit by buying the securities back at a lower price.
That strategy backfired yesterday and dealers were forced to buy back shares at higher prices. 

Mr. Kazis said a small number of retail accounts, insurance companies, mutual funds and other institutional investors, were buying bonds on speculation that the Federal Reserve will ease credit conditions in the U.S. as part of a grand strategy to force the dollar lower.
Although several Fed members have said repeatedly that controlling the value of the dollar isn't a major priority, that fact didn't stop bond investors from trying to second-guess central bank officials. 

Even without help from the Fed, some economists now believe that the bond market is set to recover from two months of lackluster trading activity. 

"I think we're on the verge of a period of declining {U.S.} interest rates," said Mickey Levy, chief economist at First Fidelity Bank Corp., Philadelphia.
He expects bond prices to rise as fresh economic statistics portray a weakening economy. 

Some economic reports started to trickle in yesterday and contributed to the market's firmer tone.
The Labor Department reported that initial claims for unemployment jumped by 9,000 in the week ended Sept. 23 to 328,000 from 319,000 in the previous week.
That report, "got people a little less worried about the employment report," said Maury Harris, economist at PaineWebber Inc. 

Today's employment report for September has been anxiously awaited by investors.
Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Inc. expect, on average, a 182,000 rise in September nonfarm payrolls.
The consensus of estimate by 21 economists is for a 5.2% civilian unemployment rate, unchanged from August.

Corporate Issues Corporate bonds closed 1/2 point higher. 

In the junk bond market, Southmark Corp. issues fell on news that National Heritage Inc. 's board will meet next week to study whether to continue its regular dividend. 

Southmark owns 62.5% of National Heritage Inc. Southmark's 11 1/2% senior notes due 1991 and its 11 7/8% senior notes due 1993 fell one point. 

Four months after its initial public offering, Weirton Steel Corp. tapped the market with its first public debt offering.
The nation's seventh-largest steelmaker, based in Weirton, W.Va., offered $300 million in 10-year senior notes that were priced at 99.50 to yield 10.958%. 

Robert Shapiro, executive vice president and head of the new-issue department at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said the offering attracted broad investor interest and was quickly snapped up. 

"Given the market environment, given the industry and given the ratings, this conspired to be a more difficult transaction to sell," said Mr. Shapiro. "However, it went extraordinarily well." 

The non-callable bonds included event-risk protection that allow investors to redeem the bonds at par in the event of a change in control, as defined by the company.
A Weirton spokesman said the event-risk language was essential to sell the securities. "We felt that if we didn't have the event-risk, we probably wouldn't have been able to do the deal," he said. 

When it went public in June, the predominantly employee-owned company hoped to glean the advantages of being publicly traded, namely an enhanced ability to raise debt financing, while retaining the benefits of an ESOP. 

Foreign Bonds 

Foreign government bonds closed unchanged to modestly lower after the Bundesbank raised interest rates.
Most major central banks followed the Bundesbank's lead, with Japan and the U.S. major exceptions. 

Bond dealers in several countries said foreign bonds didn't fall sharply because interest rate hikes were widely expected and had been factored into the market. 

Germany's benchmark 6 3/4% Treasury bond due 1999 fell 0.05 point to 98.15 to yield 7.01% while the 6 3/4% notes due 1994 were off 0.05 point to 98.175 to yield 7.205%.

The benchmark No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers screens at 96.02 to yield 5.265%.

But in Britain, government bonds ended mixed.
The Treasury's benchmark 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 rose 1/2 point at 111 3/4 to yield 10.16%.

Freddie Mac issued a $500 million Remic backed by 9 1/2% securities and a $325 million Remic backed by 10% securities. 

Traders said keen investor demand for derivative securities with two-year to five-year average lives is aiding the creation of new Remics, or real estate mortgage investment conduits.
