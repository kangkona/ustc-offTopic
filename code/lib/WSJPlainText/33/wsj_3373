The U.S. taxable bond market, as measured by the Salomon Brothers Broad Investment-Grade Bond Index, rebounded from August's loss to post a non-annualized total return of 0.52% in September. 

Total return measures price change plus income plus reinvested income, and all returns except yearly figures are non-annualized, according to a release from Salomon Brothers Inc. 

Mortgage fixed-income securities were the top performers among the major sectors.
The 0.70% return for the month also makes this sector the leader for the third quarter and year-to-date. 

Salomon said the high-yield, or junk bond, market turned in its weakest performance since the third quarter of 1987.
However, the firm added that the returns were widely divergent.
Nearly 14% of the issues posted a negative return of -5% or worse, while 62% registered positive returns.
The overall high-yield composite index posted a negative 1.80% total return for September and a year-to-date return of 4.48%.
The long-term high-yield industrials and the long-term high-yield utilities posted total returns for the month of September, of minus 1.87% and 0.42%, and year-to-date returns of 2.93% and 14.24%, respectively. 

The Salomon Brothers Broad Investment-Grade Bond Index covers all U.S. Treasury, Federal Agency, corporate and mortgage fixed-income securities with a maturity of one year or more; an issue size outstanding of $25 million or more; and a rating of BBB or better.
