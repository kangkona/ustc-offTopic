In your Sept. 1 page-one article about Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, you omitted the decision he most likely will be remembered for -- the extinction of an entire species.
About 11,000 sea turtles are drowned every year in U.S. waters as a result of entrapment in shrimping trawl nets, in flagrant violation of the law.
Specifically, the Kemp's Ridley sea turtle has become the unfortunate victim of shrimpers' nets, principally along the Gulf Coast.
In late July, Secretary Mosbacher "caved in" to pressure from shrimpers and Sen. Howell T. Heflin (D., Ala.) to further delay implementing sea-turtle-saving regulations. 

While the Kemp's Ridley was declared an endangered species some time ago and while industry has had 10 years to solve the problem to its liking, the government remains reluctant to enforce the use of Turtle Exclusion Devices (so-called "TEDs").
The use of TEDs has been demonstrated to reduce the drownings of sea turtles significantly, perhaps by as much as 90%.
Mr. Mosbacher's inaction is destroying the Kemp's Ridley faster than they can reproduce. 

The use of TEDs, which was to be effective July 1, was deferred by Mr. Mosbacher, allegedly for more scientific studies.
The protection of these sea turtles has been mandated by law and ordered by a U.S. Court of Appeals.
The secretary may well be remembered as the man who had it within his power to save a species that has been on Earth for more than 200 million years, but instead contributed to its destruction.
