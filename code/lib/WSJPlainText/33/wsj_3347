Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. agreed to pay a $150,000 civil fine in a settlement with Georgia securities regulators.
The move is related to federal criminal insider-trading charges Drexel pleaded guilty to last month. 

A Drexel spokesman said the embattled firm now has settled with 21 states.
He noted the agreement enables it to continue doing business in Georgia. "We went out to the states to try to resolve these matters and get them behind us," said the spokesman. 

As reported, Drexel pleaded guilty in September to six felony counts of securities and mail fraud in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. 

In an administrative order yesterday, Max Cleland, Georgia's commissioner of securities, placed Drexel on administrative probation for two years.
In signing the order, Drexel waived its right to an administrative hearing without admitting or denying the state's findings. 

As part of its settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Drexel has agreed to set up a $350 million escrow fund to be used to pay investors who have been damaged by the insider-trading activity to which Drexel has pleaded guilty.
Separately, Drexel agreed to pay a $25,000 fine to Georgia for improper supervision of transactions Drexel made in the name of Gold Key Financial Inc., an Atlanta investment concern whose promoter has been convicted of fraud and which is now in receivership.
