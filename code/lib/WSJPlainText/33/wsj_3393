Stan West Mining Corp., Scottsdale, Ariz., said it agreed to acquire Kimco Energy Corp. of Denver in a transaction that will give effective control of Stan West to Kimco. 

Terms of the transaction, which will give a 49% stake in Stan West to Kimco, will be worked out this week, Kimco said, but Stan West will move to Denver and will be run by Kimco managers. 

In January, when Stan West said it was seeking a buyer, the company had an indicated value of $33.8 million. 

Earlier this year, Stan West suspended operations at its only producing property, the McCabe gold and silver mine near Prescott, Ariz.
