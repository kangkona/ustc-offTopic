The bill is a compromise between one the TV industry supported, which passed Congress last year but was vetoed by President Reagan, and a tougher measure proposed this year by Sen. Tim Wirth (D., Colo.). 

The measure was approved on a voice vote by the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, but Sen. Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii) persuaded the committee not to send the legislation to the Senate for 30 days.
