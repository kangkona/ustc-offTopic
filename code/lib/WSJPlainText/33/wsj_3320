In response to your Sept. 12 article "'Christian' Planners Appear Worldly to Secular Rivals," I submit that it is outrageous for anyone to profess that he alone is blessed with values and good judgment by mere association with the title "Christian." There are many more people than the media cover working as brokers, advisers and planners, who absolutely keep their clients' best interests a priority and actively live exemplary ethical lives.
