Italy's gross domestic product rose a real, or inflation-adjusted, 0.4% in the second quarter from the first quarter and was up 3.1% from a year earlier, the national statistics bureau, ISTAT, said. 

The growth rates, adjusted for seasonal factors, compared with a quarterly increase of 0.8% and a year-on-year increase of 3.2% in the first quarter. 

ISTAT also said that the year-on-year rise in GDP was due to increases in all major parts of the national accounts.
Domestic consumption was up 3.7% from a year earlier.
This was down slightly from the 4.0% increase in the fist quarter.
