Regarding Willard Spiegelman's review, "Big D Inaugurates Pei Symphony Hall" (Leisure & Arts, Sept. 13), we Dallasites are pleased to see that our fair city's flair for hyperbole is still thriving, though little else around here is.
We've already had national recognition for our bank failures and real-estate depression.
Now, taking its place alongside an airport that is larger than Manhattan is a symphony hall that is smaller than a breadbox. 

These, however, are mere warm-ups.
Folks in the rest of the world should get ready to eat their hearts out about a true "piece de resistance" rumored to be in the making hereabouts: A savings-and-loan association that will be not just solvent but run by honest, competent people]
