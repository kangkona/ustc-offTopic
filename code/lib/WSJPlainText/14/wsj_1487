A shareholder filed suit, seeking to block Unitel Video Inc. 's proposed plan to be acquired by a new affiliate of closely held Kenmare Capital Corp. for $15 a share, or $33.6 million. 

The suit, which seeks class-action status, was filed in Delaware Chancery Court.
The complaint alleges that the price is "unfair and grossly inadequate" and that the defendants are seeking to ensure a "lockup" of the purchase of Unitel, thereby discouraging other bids.
It seeks unspecified money damages.
The New York company called the lawsuit without merit. 

Shareholders are scheduled to vote on the transaction Nov.
