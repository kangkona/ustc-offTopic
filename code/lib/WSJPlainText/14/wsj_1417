ENGRAPH INC. recently reported third-quarter earnings, which were mistakenly shown in the Quarterly Earnings Surprises table in last Tuesday's edition to be lower than the average of analysts' estimates.
Zacks Investment Research didn't adjust one analyst's estimate for a stock split, which therefore was artificially high.
Engraph's third-quarter net income of 15 cents a share actually was 7% higher than the adjusted average of estimates.
