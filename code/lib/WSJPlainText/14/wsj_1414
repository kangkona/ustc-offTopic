Rochester Telephone Corp. said it completed its purchase of Urban Telephone Corp., of Clintonville, Wis., the second-largest unaffiliated independent telephone company in that state. 

Rochester Telephone said the acquisition was made in an exchange of its common shares for all the shares of Urban Telephone, but a price wasn't disclosed. 

Urban is the company's first telephone subsidiary in Wisconsin.
Since June, Rochester Telephone signed letters of intent to purchase three other Wisconsin firms.
