ENFIELD Corp. said in Toronto that it hopes to raise 56 million Canadian dollars (US$47.7 million) through a rights offering to shareholders.
Under the offer, shareholders can purchase one Enfield share at C$6.27 for each five shares held.
In Toronto Stock Exchange trading Friday, Enfield closed at C$6.75, down 37.5 cents.
The holding company said the rights offering should reduce its C$171 million debt to "more manageable levels" before Dec. 31 and allow it to finance future investments with equity capital.
