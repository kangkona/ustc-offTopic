The top state environmental official in Massachusetts said Clean Harbors Inc. 's environmental-impact statement for a proposed incinerator in Braintree was inadequate. 

The official, John DeVillars, asked Clean Harbors for more information before ruling on a permit for the site.
Critics of the plan, including the town of Braintree, say the incinerator is a health hazard. 

Clean Harbors, based in Quincy, said it "will proceed expeditiously" to submit the data requested.
Alan McKim, chief executive officer of Clean Harbors said he was "very much encouraged" by the official's praise of Clean Harbors for the quality of some of the data in the report.
