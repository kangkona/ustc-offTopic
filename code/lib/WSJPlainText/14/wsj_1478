The Office of Thrift Supervision banned B.J. Garman, a former director of the failed Vision Banc Savings Association of Kingsville, Texas, from working in any financial institution insured by the government. 

The office, a Treasury Department unit that is the successor to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said this was the first announcement of an enforcement action since this year's thrift-bailout legislation ordered that all such actions by federal banking regulators be made public. 

Generally, regulators haven't announced enforcement actions in the past.
Indeed, the OTS said that before the law took effect Aug. 9, it banned another "key Vision Banc insider" from insured financial institutions.
That individual wasn't identified. 

Vision Banc was placed in government conservatorship in March, and it operates under the control of the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency created to sell or liquidate insolvent thrifts. 

The OTS didn't say specifically why the action was taken against Ms. Garman.
However, it said examiners found a variety of insider dealings at the thrift, including "extraordinary loan commissions" paid to a firm associated with Vision Banc officials, and loans diverted through borrowers back to the thrift officials. 

Ms. Garman couldn't be reached for comment.
