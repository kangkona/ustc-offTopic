Dow Chemical Co. said its Destec Energy Inc. unit has agreed to buy PSE Inc., a Houston energy company, in a deal valued at about $115 million. 

Dow, of Midland, Mich., said its unit will begin by Thursday a tender offer of $12.25 a share for all PSE common shares outstanding.
Among other conditions, the offer depends on the Dow unit acquiring at least 66 2/3% of the PSE shares outstanding, the companies said in a joint statement Friday. 

PSE has about 9.2 million shares outstanding.
The company said the approximately $115 million acquisition price includes its total $33 million of long-term debt outstanding.
Dow said it already has agreements with Albert J. Smith Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of PSE, and certain other officers of the company under which Dow may buy about 40% of the PSE common shares outstanding. 

PSE is a designer and operator of energy-cogeneration facilities and had 1988 sales of $234 million.
The company is owner and operator, or an equity partner, in six cogeneration facilities -- two in Texas and four in California. 

The company said recently it expects third-quarter earnings will be in range from $1.3 million to $1.7 million, or 14 cents to 18 cents a share, compared with $326,000, or four cents a share, a year ago.
