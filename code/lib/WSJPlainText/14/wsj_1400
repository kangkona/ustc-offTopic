CRI Inc. said it reduced the estimated cash distribution for its Capital Housing and Mortgage Partners Inc. trust to between 71 cents and 74 cents a share, from between 75 cents and 80 cents, for the year ending June 9, 1990. 

The change in expected cash distributions from the Champs real estate investment trust stems from a revised estimate of administrative costs, said Jay R. Cohen, Champs executive vice president. 

CRI, which sponsors Champs, is a world-wide real estate investment firm.
