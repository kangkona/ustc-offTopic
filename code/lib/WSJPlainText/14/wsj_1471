Chairman Jamie Whitten (D., Miss.) of the House Appropriations Committee proposed a $2.85 billion emergency funding package to assist California's recovery from last week's earthquake and extend further aid to East Coast victims of Hurricane Hugo. 

The sweeping measure incorporates $500 million in small-business loans, $1 billion in highway-construction funds and $1.25 billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to President Bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters.
The funds would be attached to a stop-gap spending bill required to keep most of the government operating past Wednesday. 

The measure is scheduled to be taken up by the Appropriations Committee today.
The panel is expected to add provisions waiving restrictions on the use of federal highway funds and may also shift money within the package to bolster the share for the Small Business Administration. "We will support it, we will thank him, and we will augment it where appropriate," said Rep. Vic Fazio (D., Calif.). 

Dubbed the "Dire Emergency Supplemental to Meet the Needs of Natural Disasters of National Significance," the measure is vintage Whitten in asserting federal responsibility and in disdaining budget impediments. "Such other amounts will be made available subsequently as required," the legislation reads, and the new obligations "shall not be a charge against the Budget Act, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, or other ceilings."
