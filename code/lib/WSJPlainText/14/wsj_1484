A group including ESL Partners Ltd., a Fort Worth, Texas, investment partnership, and Richard E. Rainwater, a former adviser to the Fort Worth Bass family, said it reduced its stake in Anacomp Inc. to 3.6% of the common shares outstanding. 

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group said it sold 1,325,900 Anacomp common shares from Aug. 31 to last Wednesday for $4.48 to $5.84 a share, resulting in a drop in its holdings to 1,351,662 shares. 

No reason was given in the filing for the sales. 

An Anacomp official said the Indianapolis computer-services concern had no comment on the group's share sales. 

In March, the group disclosed it held a 7.2% stake in Anacomp for investment purposes.
It said then it had had and would continue to have discussions with Anacomp's management concerning its investment.
