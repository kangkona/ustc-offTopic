Grand Metropolitan PLC, the United Kingdom food and beverage group that owns Pillsbury Inc. of the U.S., announced a reshuffling of board-level executive duties intended to fit the company's recent expansion. 

David Nash, formerly group finance director at Cadbury Schweppes PLC, will become Grand Met's first group finance director in January. 

In a statement, Grand Met said its recent "growth and wider geographic spread" made it necessary to create the new position. 

The company also reassigned several executive responsibilities.
David Tagg, formerly in charge of gambling operations, was appointed chief executive for retailing and property.
Peter Cawdron, group strategy development director, and Bill Shardlow, group personnel director, will become part of the board's management committee.
