Burmah Oil PLC, a British independent oil and specialty-chemicals marketing concern, said SHV Holdings N.V. has built up a 7.5% stake in the company. 

The holding of 13.6 million shares is up from a 6.7% stake that Burmah announced SHV held as of last Monday. 

SHV, of the Netherlands, which last year merged its North Sea oil and gas operations with those of Calor Group PLC and which owns 40% of Calor, was identified as a possible suitor for Burmah. 

Burmah said it hadn't held any discussions with SHV and that "no deal of any nature is in contemplation."
