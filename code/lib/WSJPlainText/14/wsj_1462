Royal Business Group Inc. said it filed suit in federal court here charging Realist Inc. and its directors with violating federal securities laws "by engaging in a scheme to prevent" Royal from acquiring Realist. 

Royal, which makes and distributes business forms, owns an 8% stake in Realist.
Royal contends that Realist failed to disclose material information, including Realist's negotiations to acquire Ammann Laser Technik AG, to stockholders prior to Realist's June 6 annual meeting.
Royal's suit contends that the Ammann acquisition was "designed to entrench management and thwart Royal's offer." 

Royal withdrew its offer to buy Realist, a maker of optical and electronic products based in Menomonee Falls, Wis., for $14.06 a share in July after Realist disclosed the Ammann purchase.
The suit seeks "in excess of $350,000 in damages." 

A Realist official said the company hadn't yet received the full complaint and wouldn't have a response until it had an opportunity to review it.
