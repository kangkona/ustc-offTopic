Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance PLC, a major British composite insurer, said it is taking a stake in Nationwide Anglia Building Society's estate agency business as part of a plan to create a range of commercial linkages in the U.K. and Europe. 

Officials declined to disclose the value of the transaction or the exact stake that GRE will hold in Nationwide Anglia Estate Agents.
But the companies said that Nationwide Anglia Estate Agents will market GRE life insurance, pension and investment products through its more than 1,000 retail outlets in the U.K. 

Besides the marketing agreement, GRE said Nationwide Anglia has agreed to develop life insurance products with the composite insurer.
