The long-running scandal surrounding the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano was reignited by the arrest last week of Rome businessman Flavio Carboni on fraud charges. 

Rome magistrates accuse Mr. Carboni and several other people of trying to extort 1.2 billion lire ($880,000) from the Vatican in return for documents contained in the briefcase of Roberto Calvi, the Ambrosiano chairman found hanged under London's Blackfriar's Bridge shortly before the bank's collapse. 

Banco Ambrosiano, which was Italy's largest private-sector bank, collapsed in 1982 with $1.3 billion of debts.
Most of the money was lent to a series of shell companies in Panama and Luxembourg that were owned, directly or indirectly, by the Vatican bank.
The Vatican, which denies any wrongdoing, paid $250 million to the Milan bank's creditors as a "goodwill gesture" in 1985. 

Italian news reports said Mr. Carboni and a colleague obtained 1.2 billion lire in checks from a Vatican official, Pavel Hnilica.
Italian papers speculated the briefcase contained papers either exonerating the Vatican bank from blame in the scandal, or showing that the bank, known as the Istituto per le Opere di Religione, channeled funds to East bloc groups such as Solidarity in Poland. 

Neither Mr. Hnilica, Mr. Carboni nor Vatican officials could be reached for comment over the weekend.
