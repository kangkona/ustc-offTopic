Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the ratings of some $145 million of Pinnacle debt because of "accelerating deficiency in liquidity," which it said was evidenced by Pinnacle's elimination of dividend payments.
Henry Sargent Jr., Pinnacle executive vice president, said the action "won't really have any effect on us.
We aren't selling bonds right now, and I don't think it will affect the value of our existing bonds." The rating agency said it lowered the ratings on $75 million of the holding company's convertible subordinated Eurodebentures to B-3 from B-1.
Moody's said it also lowered the ratings of $70 million of Pinnacle's MeraBank thrift unit long-term deposits to B-3 from B-2, and on its subordinated debt to Ca from Caa.
MeraBank's rating for short-term deposits remains Not Prime.
Securities of MeraBank were placed under review last May, and will remain under review for downgrade, the agency said.
