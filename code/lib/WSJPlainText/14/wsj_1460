Britain's Serious Fraud Office said it will investigate the circumstances surrounding alleged phantom contracts at Ferranti International Signal PLC's International Signal & Control unit. 

The investigation, which will be coordinated with one already under way in the U.S., follows the discovery of what Ferranti has called a "serious" fraud involving its U.S. subsidiary. 

International Signal & Control, Lancaster, Pa., a defense-equipment manufacturer, was bought by Ferranti in 1987 for #420 million ($670.3 million).
Ferranti has said that it would be forced to write off #185 million against the phantom contracts, reducing its net asset value by more than half. 

The Serious Fraud Office, a division of London's Metropolitan Police responsible for investigating financial crimes, said its work would take in "allegations of fraud prior to, surrounding and subsequent to the merger." 

Ferranti said that it welcomes the investigation and that it will "cooperate fully." Derek Alun-Jones, Ferranti's chairman, has said he hoped to pursue legal action against those responsible. 

The British defense electronics group has said it will sell #100 million in assets and may seek a merger to strengthen itself in the wake of its troubles.
