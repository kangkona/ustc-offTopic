Pittston Co. 's third-quarter net income plunged 79%, reflecting the impact of a prolonged and bitter labor strike at its coal operations. 

Net sank to $3.1 million, or eight cents a share, including $789,000, or two cents a share, reflecting a tax-loss carry-forward.
In the year-ago quarter, net totaled $14.7 million, or 38 cents a share, including $4 million, or 10 cents a share, reflecting a tax-loss carry-forward.
Revenue slipped 0.7% to $395.3 million from $398.3 million. 

Pittston also owns Brink's Inc., the security service, and Burlington Air Express, the air-freight concern. 

In addition to expected losses tied to the labor strike, the coal group has spent almost $20 million since the strike began for security, the company said.
As a result, the group's third-quarter loss widened to $9.8 million from the second quarter's $3.6 million.
Pittston continues to hire replacement workers, the company said. 

Burlington's operating profit grew to $9.2 million from $3.8 million a year earlier, Pittston said.
While "the tone" of domestic and international air-freight markets remains sound, seasonal factors are likely to hinder Burlington Air from matching third-quarter results in the fourth quarter, Pittston said. 

Brink's operating profit was about flat with the year-earlier period, reflecting continued pricing and cost pressures. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Pittston closed at $18.50 a share, down 12.5 cents.
