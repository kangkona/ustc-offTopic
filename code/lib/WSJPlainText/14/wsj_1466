The Better Business Bureau of San Diego and the state Attorney General's office entered into a settlement stemming from an investigation of bureau-sponsored business directories published by an outside firm, Better Book Inc. 

The settlement stems from charges that Better Book, now defunct, made misrepresentations in selling advertising for the directories and memberships in the bureau from 1984 to 1986.
Without admitting any guilt, the bureau agreed to several conditions if it again contracts with an outside firm to publish its directories. 

The conditions include not misrepresenting how many directories will be distributed, and agreeing to make refunds to directory advertisers if any misrepresentations are involved in the sale. 

The Attorney General's investigation was sparked by lawsuits and charges by angry California businesspeople that they were swindled in a bureau-sponsored directory project contracted by Better Book.
The uproar led to the closing of the Los Angeles Better Business Bureau in late 1987.
