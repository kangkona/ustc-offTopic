A former Sperry Corp. marketing executive, admitting his role in the Pentagon procurement scandal, pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges for helping funnel $400,000 to a midlevel Navy acquisition official during the early 1980s. 

Frank Lavelle, who at the time was the marketing director for Sperry in Clearwater, Fla., admitted participating in a scheme to bribe Garland Tomlin, the Navy official.
Mr. Tomlin, who left the Navy in 1985, pleaded guilty earlier this year to related conspiracy, bribery and tax-evasion charges. 

The bribery scheme took place between 1982 and 1985, according to documents filed by prosecutors in connection with Mr. Lavelle's guilty plea in federal district court in Alexandria, Va.
Sperry merged with Burroughs Corp. to become Unisys Corp. in late 1986. 

Court documents filed by prosecutors indicate Mr. Tomlin tried to steer to Sperry a multimillion dollar contract to computerize maintenance of certain Navy electronics equiment.
Mr. Tomlin, among other things, illegally provided Mr. Lavelle with inside information and documents intended to give Sperry an unfair advantage in the competition, the documents said.
Sperry ultimately was eliminated from the competition without receiving the work. 

Documents filed by prosecutors also indicate that Mr. Lavelle and his fellow conspirators requested and obtained "approval of the scheme" from more-senior Sperry officials "because the payment which {Mr.} Tomlin requested was so large." Charles Gardner, a former Unisys vice president, and James Neal, a former company consultant, have admitted participating in this and other bribery schemes.
Unisys has said that all of the company officials who participated in improper activities have left the company. 

Mr. Lavelle faces a maximum of 20 years in jail and a $500,000 fine.
