Eastern Enterprises, bolstered by improved tonnages in its marine-shipping unit, had a narrower third-quarter net loss of $1.1 million, or five cents a share. 

Last year, Eastern had a quarter loss of $1.7 million, or eight cents a share. 

Quarter revenue rose 44% to $160.1 million from $111.2 million a year ago. 

The Weston, Mass., utilities and marine-transport concern said results for the third quarter, usually a money-losing one because of the seasonality of the gas business, were also aided by higher gas sales and the May 1989 acquisition of Water Products Company. 

For the nine months, Eastern had net income of $41.8 million, or $1.80 a share, up 23% from $33.9 million or $1.46 a share a year ago.
Revenue grew 24% to $614.5 million from $497.1 million.
