Falcon Cable Systems Co. said it proposed an amendment that would allow it to increase its debt cap to 65% of the company's fair market value from the 40% currently allowed.
Falcon, a limited partnership, said it wanted the increase in order to continue its $2.15-per-unit annual payment, and for expansion and acquisitions. 

A spokesman for the company said a meeting would be held for shareholders to vote on the amendment before year's end.
