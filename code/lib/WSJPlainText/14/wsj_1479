Arizona Instrument Corp. said it expects to post a third-quarter net loss of about $600,000, or 25 cents to 27 cents a share, compared with net income of $214,000, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier. 

The Tempe, Ariz., maker of underground fuel-storage systems said the most recent period was affected by customers' problems complying with recent Environmental Protection Agency regulations. 

For the nine months, the company expects to post a net loss of about $879,000, or 35 cents to 40 cents a share, on revenue of $6.5 million.
A year earlier, it had a loss of $199,203 or nine cents a share, on revenue of $7.6 million.
