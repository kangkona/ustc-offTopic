The following were among Friday's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. capital markets, with terms and syndicate manager, as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report: 

Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp. -- $475 million of senior subordinated resettable debentures, due Oct. 15, 2001, priced at par to yield 14.75%.
The coupon will be reset in one year at a rate that will give the issue a market value of 101.
However, the maximum coupon rate on the issue when it is reset can only be 15.5%.
Debenture holders will also receive the equivalent of 10% of the common stock of CNW Holdings.
The equity kicker is not attached to the offering, but underwriters said it will be offered after a filing for 68,548 common shares of CNW Holdings is declared effective by the Securities & Exchange Commission.
The issue is noncallable for five years and has a sinking fund starting in 2000 to retire 50% of the issue before maturity.
Rated single-B-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and single-B-minus by Standard & Poor's Corp., the issue will be sold through underwriters led by Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. 

Tokuyama Soda Co. (Japan) -- $200 million of Eurobonds due Nov. 9, 1993, with equity-purchase warrants, indicating a 4% coupon at par, via Nomura International Ltd.
Each $5,000 bond carries one warrant, exercisable from Nov. 28, 1989, through Oct. 28, 1993, to buy company shares at an expected premium of 2 1/2% to the closing share price when terms are fixed Oct. 27.
