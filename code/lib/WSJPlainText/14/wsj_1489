Comair Holdings Inc. said in Cincinnati that it bought Airline Aviation Academy, a pilot training school based at Sanford Regional Airport near Orlando, Fla.
Comair said it paid cash but declined to disclose the price. 

Comair Holdings is the parent of Comair Inc., a regional air carrier. 

Airline Aviation, which has annual revenue of $5 million to $6 million, has great growth potential because of the large number of U.S. pilots nearing retirement age, Comair said.
The unit will be renamed Comair Aviation Academy and will continue to be headed by Scott Williams, a son of its founder, Comair said.
