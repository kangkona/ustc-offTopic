While welcoming Nicholas McInnes's Sept. 18 letter offering corrections to your "World-Wide Tax Revolution" table (editorial page, Aug. 29), I am surprised that he neglected other errors that, for some of us, strike close to home. 

As a Channel Islander, I was amazed to see my birthplace listed as one of "86 countries with an income tax." Despite a history of heated local debate on the topic, my passport clearly reads "British citizen." Whether Mr. McInnes's oversight is merely a sign of a mainlander's benign neglect is a question my fellow Channel Islanders (and friends on the Isle of Man) will continue to ponder.
