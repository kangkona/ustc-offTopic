Bankers Trust New York Corp., as expected, reported a third-quarter loss of $1.42 billion, or $17.39 a share, following its $1.6 billion boost in reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries. 

The loss compares with net income of $162.1 million, or $2.01 a share, in the year-earlier period.
Interest income rose 29% to about $1.35 billion from $1.05 billion.
The New York bank holding company's assets at Sept. 30 climbed to $59.4 billion from $57.9 billion. 

Excluding the increase in loan-loss reserves, Bankers Trust said third-quarter net income would have increased 11% to $180 million.
A number of major banks have posted big losses after sharply increasing loan-loss reserves.
Most of the loans in question are to Third World countries in South America. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Bankers Trust fell 12.5 cents to $50.50.
