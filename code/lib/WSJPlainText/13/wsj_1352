LDI Corp., Cleveland, said it will offer $50 million in commercial paper backed by lease-rental receivables.
The program matches funds raised from the sale of the commercial paper with small to medium-sized leases.
LDI termed the paper "non-recourse financing," meaning that investors would be repaid from the lease receivables, rather than directly by LDI Corp. LDI leases and sells data-processing, telecommunications and other high-tech equipment.
