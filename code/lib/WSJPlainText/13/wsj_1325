Dana Corp. said its third-quarter net income fell 27% to $29.6 million, or 72 cents a share, from $40.7 million, or $1 a share, a year earlier.
Sales dropped 4% to $1.12 billion from $1.17 billion. 

The company, which supplies transmissions and other drive-train parts to auto makers, said about half the earnings drop came from the "virtual collapse" of the Venezuelan auto industry.
The Venezuelan currency plummeted this year, making it difficult for auto makers there to afford imported parts.
Dana also said it was hurt by slumping U.S. truck sales and by a strike at a parts supplier. 

The company, based in Toledo, Ohio, had said it expected reduced third-quarter profit.
Mary Anne Sudol, an analyst at Fitch Investors in New York, said automotive suppliers were reporting lower profit almost "across the board." 

Southwood J. Morcott, Dana's president, said the company's decision to approve its normal fourth-quarter dividend indicated its underlying strength.
