Archive Corp. said it expects to report net income for its fiscal year ended Sept. 29 of a record $15 million, or $1.15 a share, up 43% from $10.5 million, or 80 cents a share, for the prior year. 

The Costa Mesa, Calif., maker of computer tape drives also projected record revenue for the year of $181 million, up from $122.7 million for the previous year. 

Archive attributed the gains to strong demand for its products, continued growth of the reseller market and the acquisition of Maynard Electronics in February, which accounted for about 14% of the company's revenue.
