Enviropact Inc. said it entered into an agreement in principle to sell its pump and tank division and drilling division to GSX Chemical Services for $4 million. 

The Miami-based environmental engineering concern said GSX Chemical also will assume about $1.6 million in debt related to those divisions. 

Further, GSX will buy $1 million of Enviropact common stock, at $2.625 a share, plus an option to acquire an additional $1.5 million of common at the same price, the company said.
In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Enviropact closed at $3 a share, up 25 cents. 

Enviropact said the two divisions account for about $8 million of the company's $20 million in annual revenue.
The transaction is expected to close within about 20 days, the company added. 

Enviropact said the proceeds will be used as working capital for expansion and to pay its existing tax liability of about $1.5 million that was due Sept. 15. 

GSX is a unit of Laidlaw Transportation Ltd. of Burlington, Canada.
