A federal judge in Manhattan has entered a judgment requiring a Chicago organized crime figure to pay the government $250,000, representing alleged profits he gained from his involvement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. 

Manhattan U.S. Attorney Otto Obermaier said it was the first time ever that the government had obtained any disgorgement from an organized crime figure indicted under the civil racketeering law. 

Joseph Lombardo, who the government alleged was the "captain" of organized crime in Chicago, was one of numerous defendants in the government's sweeping racketeering suit against the Teamsters.
In the suit, filed in June 1988, the government accused the union's leadership of depriving its 1.6 million members of their rights through a pattern of racketeering.
Among other things, the government claimed that organized crime figures had routinely handpicked the union's top officials. 

U.S. District Judge David Edelstein also permanently enjoined Mr. Lombardo from any future dealings with the Teamsters or any other labor union. 

Mr. Lombardo, the last of the defendants to settle the suit, agreed to pay the government the $250,000 within one week.
