Legent Corp. said it expects to report net income between $6.4 million and $6.9 million, or between 32 cents and 34 cents a share, for its fourth quarter ended Sept. 30.
In the year-ago quarter, the software developer reported pro forma earnings of $4.8 million, or 24 cents a share. 

Vienna, Va.-based Legent said it expects to post revenue for the quarter of more than $31 million, compared with pro forma revenue of $25.2 million in 1988. 

For the fiscal year, the company said it anticipates reporting earnings of $23 million, or about $1.15 a share, including a charge of about $5.9 million, or 22 cents a share, related to the merger that created Legent out of Duquesne Systems Inc. and Morino Inc. in March 1989.
Revenue for fiscal 1989 is expected to exceed $124 million. 

Pro forma earnings for fiscal 1988 were $19.6 million, or 99 cents a share, on revenue of $97.2 million. 

The company attributed much of the growth in earnings to increased demand for its systems productivity software.
