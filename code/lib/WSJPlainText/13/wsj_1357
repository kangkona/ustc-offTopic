A federal judge granted a temporary stay of the California Student Aid Commission's emergency action to stop guaranteeing loans for National Technical Schools, a unit of United Education & Software Inc. 

The California Student Aid Commission took the action Oct. 15 after a government audit cited National Technical Schools for having courses too short to be eligible for the educational loan program and having a student drop-out rate far in excess of federal standards, and it alleged other serious violations of law and regulations.
United Education & Software, a Los Angeles education services company, called the commission's action "precipitous and unwarranted." 

The court set a hearing on the emergency action for Oct. 30.
United Education & Software posted a $250,000 bond against potential losses to the student aid commission and to taxpayers in guaranteeing any more loans for National Technical Schools students prior to the hearing.
