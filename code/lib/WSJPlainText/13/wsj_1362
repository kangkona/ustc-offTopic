Detrex Corp. said a reserve it is establishing to cover expected pollution cleanup costs at an Ohio plant reduced its third-quarter net income by $1.9 million. 

Detrex, which has annual sales of about $100 million, declined to say if it would post a loss in the third quarter.
The Southfield, Mich.-based company earned $774,000 in the quarter last year. 

Detrex is setting aside $3.1 million for the cleanup, but said the reserve reduced its quarterly income by only $1.9 million because of tax considerations. 

In addition, the manufacturer said it signed a consent decree with Ohio to build a $1.4 million pollution-control facility at the Ashtabula chemical manufacturing plant by Aug. 1, 1990. 

Detrex said it is one of at least 17 companies notified by the Environmental Protection Agency that they may be potentially responsible for cleaning up the Fields Brook watershed near Detrex's Ashtabula plant at a total cost the EPA estimates at $48 million -- a figure Detrex said the companies dispute.
