Norimasa Furuta, president of Japan's Mazda Motor Corp., said the Japanese car maker is planning joint production with Ford Motor Co. in Europe ahead of the European Community's 1992 integration. 

Mr. Furuta didn't disclose further details of the arrangement at a news conference, but said the project would be undertaken with Ford's European subsidiary. 

A Ford official confirmed in Tokyo that the U.S. motor vehicle maker is studying such an arrangement.
