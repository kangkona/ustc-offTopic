First Executive Corp. said about 96% of the rights to purchase its depositary shares and warrants have been exercised. 

Of the 17.6 million rights units issued, just under 17 million were exercised before the Oct. 10 expiration of the offering, the insurance holding company said.
Remaining units will be sold to the underwriters, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Kidder, Peabody & Co., which will also purchase an over-allotment of 2.3 million additional units. 

First Executive said the offering will raise about $299 million -- minus underwriting fees and other expenses -- that the company plans to use to write new life insurance and annuity business.
In addition, analysts have viewed the rights offering as a takeover defense that prospectively balloons the number of shares outstanding. 

Each of the units consists of two warrants, each of which could be used to purchase a half-share of common stock, and one depositary preference share.
Depositary shares are convertible into common stock on a 1-to-1 basis.
Currently, the company has about 88.1 million common shares outstanding. 

In over-the-counter trading Monday, the stock closed at $10.625, off 37.5 cents.
