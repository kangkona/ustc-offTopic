CMS Enhancements Inc. said it estimates that sales and earnings for the fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30 fell somewhat from the year-earlier period. 

Jim Farooquee, chief executive officer of the Tustin, Calif., computer accessories supplier, said he was "comfortable" with analysts' expectations that CMS would earn between six cents and eight cents a share on revenue of about $42 million. 

A year earlier, CMS posted profit of $1.1 million, or 13 cents a share, on sales of $48 million.
This time, there are 30% more shares outstanding. 

Mr. Farooquee attributed the decline to an industrywide softening of demand for computer enhancement products.
