The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it will start enforcing stiffer regulations Jan. 31 for so-called gray-market imports of vehicles. 

The regulations, required under legislation enacted by Congress last year, will apply to imports of vehicles that weren't built to meet U.S. government auto safety standards and were intended for use in Europe or elsewhere abroad. 

U.S. officials estimated that gray-market imports total about 2,100 units a year, a small part of the more than three million vehicles exported to the U.S. each year. 

According to the NHTSA, the new regulations will prohibit anyone other than an importer that has registered with the U.S. government, or a person who has a contract with a registered importer, from permanently importing a vehicle that doesn't meet the U.S. auto safety standards. 

The registered importer would be required to bring such vehicles into compliance with the U.S. safety standards, compared with the current situation in which anyone can bring in such vehicles and modify them to meet the U.S. standards. 

Congress tightened auto safety standards for gray-market imports after U.S. auto dealers, including franchised foreign-car dealers, complained that they often were blamed when the second and third buyers of such vehicles found that the cars couldn't meet U.S. auto safety standards.
