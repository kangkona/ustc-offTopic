A.H. Belo Corp. said its net income was $3.1 million, or 15 cents a share, in the third quarter, more than four times its profit of $663,000, or three cents a share, last year. 

Included in the results was an adjustment to the Dallas-based company's tax rate that reduced net income by about 10 cents a share, or approximately $2 million.
Belo said it increased its effective tax rate to 52% from 47% to account for potential liabilities related to an Internal Revenue Service investigation of its tax returns for the years 1984 through 1988. 

The newspaper and television owner said it expects the tax adjustment to reduce its net income for the full year by 14 cents, or approximately $2.8 million based on its 20.2 million shares outstanding. 

For the third quarter, Belo said its revenue increased 11%, to $101.5 million from $91.2 million last year. 

For the nine months, the company had net income of $15.1 million, or 74 cents a share, up 98% from $7.6 million, or 38 cents a share last year.
Revenue grew almost 8% to $301.9 million from $279.8 million last year.
