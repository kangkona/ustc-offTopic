Cummins Engine Co., Columbus, Ind., hurt by a drop in engine orders from heavy-truck makers, reported a third-quarter loss of $39.7 million, or $4.12 a share, on essentially flat sales of $807.6 million. 

In the year-earlier period, the maker of diesel engines and parts had a narrower deficit of $17.6 million, or $1.84 a share, with sales of $808.3 million.
A spokeswoman said shipments of truck engines, which provide a higher margin than most of the company's other products, declined 16% from a year earlier. 

Although Cummins's stock stumbled last month after the company projected a "substantial" third-period loss, the stock also fell $1.125 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, to $51.75.
It traded as high as $64 a month ago, before the loss projection. 

For the nine months, the latest loss trimmed net income to $3.6 million, which after payment of preferred dividends represented a 31-cent loss a common share.
The year-before loss was $8.4 million, or $1.36 a common share.
