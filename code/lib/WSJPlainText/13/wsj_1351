Amtech Systems Inc., Tempe, Ariz., said its preliminary year-end results of operations indicate "substantial improvement" over the previous fiscal year. 

Amtech, which makes an automated process system that improves the yields of semiconductor manufacturers, said profit for the year ended Sept. 30 rose to more than $800,000 from $446,000 last year.
Per-share earnings are estimated at more than 40 cents, up from 22 cents for fiscal 1988. 

Total revenue is expected to double to more than $22 million from $10.8 million. 

Amtech, which also provides technical temporary employment services to aerospace, defense, computer and high-tech companies in the Southwest and Baltimore-Washington areas, said its final audited results are due in late November. 

The company attributed the improvement to strong demand in the semiconductor equipment segment as well as the acquisition of Echelon Service Co. and the inclusion of a full year's results of operations for RTS Inc., compared with seven months' results for the prior year.
