Kurzweil Music Systems Inc. said it retained Kidder, Peabody & Co. to study financial alternatives, including the possible sale of the financially struggling company. 

Kurzweil, Waltham, Mass., makes digital electronic keyboard instruments used by professional recording musicians.
It recently introduced a line for the home market.
However, Raymond C. Kurzweil, chairman and chief executive, said "The company continues to require additional funding to realize the potential of its technology." 

In the year's first six months, Kurzweil had a loss of $6.9 million on sales of $11.2 million.
Last month its president, John S. Donnelly, resigned citing "management differences" with Mr. Kurzweil.
