Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the debt ratings of certain long-term debt held by this company.
The debt-rating concern cited the bank's move into the Texas market, noting its profitability and capital adequacy measurements will be depressed relative to the bank's past performance.
Moody's also said it raised its rating on the Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank, now known as Bank One, Texas N.A., reflecting the support of other banking affiliates and substantial assistance for the FDIC. Officials at the New York bank-holding company weren't available for comment on the debt-rating changes.
