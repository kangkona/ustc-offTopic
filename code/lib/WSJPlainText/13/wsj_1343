American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said it will spend $20 million to build a factory in Guadalajara, Mexico, to make telephone answering machines. 

Construction of the 265,000-square-foot facility will begin next year, with production expected to start in late 1991.
When fully operational, the Guadalajara factory will employ about 1,500 workers and have annual operating expenses of $5 million to $6 million. 

An AT&T representative said that the Guadalajara factory will make a full line of answering machines.
AT&T already has a factory in Matamoros, Mexico, to make electrical devices.
It also purchases data systems products from a manufacturer based in Monterrey.
