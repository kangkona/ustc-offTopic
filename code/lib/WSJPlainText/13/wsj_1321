Rockwell International Corp. bought out Ikegai Corp. 's interest in Ikegai-Goss, a joint venture of the two companies based in Tokyo.
The price was 3.6 billion yen ($25 million). 

The agreement provides that Ikegai Corp. will remain a supplier to Ikegai-Goss, which makes printing presses for the newspaper industry.
