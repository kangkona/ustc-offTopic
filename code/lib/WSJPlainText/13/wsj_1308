We've heard California's property-tax-cutting Proposition 13 blamed for a lot over the years, but ABC's Ted Koppel came up with a new wrinkle in his earthquake coverage last week when he asked Democratic Assemblyman Richard Katz if Prop. 13 had withheld money needed for road maintenance.
Mr. Katz happily agreed, sliding over the fact that California's roads and bridges aren't funded by property taxes but by state and federal gasoline taxes.
Both have been raised at least 30% in recent years, even while the price of gasoline has fallen.
Dragging Prop. 13 into this story is a pretty long stretch.
