Varian Associates Inc., Palo Alto, Calif., reported fiscal fourth-quarter profit plunged more than 95% to $1 million, or five cents a share, from $24.2 million, or $1.10 a share, in the year-earlier quarter. 

The diversified electronics company blamed the decline in the quarter ended Sept. 29, on previously reported operating problems in its Electron Devices & Systems Group. 

For the full fiscal year, Varian posted a 13% profit rise to $31.5 million, or $1.53 a share, up from $27.8 million, or $1.27 a share, last year.
Sales for the year rose almost 15% to $1.34 billion from $1.17 billion last year. 

A profit last year in both the quarter and year included a net gain of $9.6 million, or 44 cents a share, from the sale of a division.
Additionally, the full-year profit last year reflected an after-tax restructuring charge of $22.8 million, or $1.04 a share. 

Shares of Varian, which last month warned there would be a fourth-quarter plunge, closed at $22.75, down 62.5 cents in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

Sales rose 18% in the fiscal fourth quarter to $364.1 million from $307.9 million on the strength in semiconductors and other products.
