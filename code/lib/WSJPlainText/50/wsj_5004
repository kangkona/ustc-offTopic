Companies in Japan's Mitsubishi Group will join U.S., Dutch and Thai interests in creating a joint venture in Thailand to produce a material for making detergents, Mitsubishi officials said. 

The company, to be called Thai Alkylate Co. and capitalized at the equivalent of 1.5 billion yen ($10 million), will be owned 27% by Mitsubishi Corp., a giant Japanese trading house; 5% by Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co.; and 16% each by Lion Corp., a leading Japanese detergent maker; Colgate-Palmolive (Thailand) Ltd., a subsidiary of Colgate-Palmolive Co. of the U.S.; and Lever Brothers (Thailand) Ltd., a Dutch affiliate. 

A Thai financial concern, Kiarti Group, will own 20% of the new company. 

Construction of the plant, capable of producing 40,000 tons of linear arkylbenzene a year, will begin in May 1990, with completion set for mid-1992.
