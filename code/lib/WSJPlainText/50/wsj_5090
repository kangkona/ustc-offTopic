Your Aug. 31 article on the FAA's requirement that airlines install "bomb detectors" and that this in some measure might avert events such as the bombing of Pan Am 103 perpetuates the myth that the Lockerbie disaster resulted from technical inadequacies.
This is something that Pan Am and the FAA would like to have the public believe, but which is contrary to any facts that have emerged. 

Only 21 pieces of baggage loaded at Frankfurt were X-rayed, and at Pan Am's request this was done at such high speed that it was a "gesture," not an inspection.
It was the Federal Aviation Administration's business to know what security measures Pan Am employed, and nothing has emerged to suggest the FAA was not fully aware, despite both the FAA and Pan Am knowing for more than a month that there was an attack planned against a Pan Am flight out of Frankfurt. 

Furthermore, a Pan Am spokesman stated that the airline could not use screening methods that require more than six seconds per bag, implying that any use of these new machines will be in a highly selective manner.
The best machines will not work if not used, and the FAA has mandated that the machines be installed, not that they be used.
The 270 people who died at Lockerbie died because someone mysteriously decided not to use the available methods.
No machine will protect against that.
