Filtertek Cos., citing hurricane-related disruption of production at its plant in Puerto Rico, trimmed its projection of third-quarter net income to about $750,000, or 11 cents a share, from the $1.2 million, or 18 cents, it had earlier predicted. 

An official for the Hebron, Ill., maker of specialty filtration products said that while Hurricane Hugo didn't damage its flagship Puerto Rico operation, the storm has temporarily stymied production by knocking out power and hampering employees' ability to come to work. 

Filtertek said it expects to recover the lost third-quarter earnings in the fourth period. 

For the year's first six months, Filtertek had net income of $3.1 million, or 45 cents a share, including an $820,000 gain from sale of a facility.
Sales totaled $19.3 million.
