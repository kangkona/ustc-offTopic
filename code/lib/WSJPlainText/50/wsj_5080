Concerning your Aug. 28 page-one story "Park Wars" about killer whales that perform at theme parks and the increasingly cut-throat competition among theme parks.
I found the cavalier attitude toward Shamu very upsetting. 

Most people in San Diego were sickened and grieved by Kandu's death and Sea World's apparent malpractice in handling the whales during the entire incident.
Many of us are wondering why the press seems to have accepted Sea World's pat responses to the tragedy.
I haven't read a single article that examines whether Kandu could have lived had the trainers not ignored her injury for 15 minutes. 

The most important question is whether animals should be used for human entertainment.
Shamu is not another Mickey Mouse.
She is a living being, born in captivity and now without the benefit of either a mother or father.
