Bass PLC said that its Coral Racing subsidiary purchased 369 betting shops in Belgium from Grand Metropolitan PLC, another major U.K. leisure and brewing company. 

Terms of the cash purchase weren't disclosed, but it is part of Grand Metropolitan's previously announced decision to dispose of its betting operations. 

Coral Racing, which operates 1,008 betting shops in the U.K. and Ireland, will take title to the Belgian properties on Friday, which marks the start of the new fiscal year for Bass and Grand Met, Coral Racing said. 

Grand Met also sold 45 William Hill shops in central London earlier Friday to Ladbroke Group PLC for #26 million ($41 million). 

Grand Met bought the William Hill betting shops from U.K. retailer Sears PLC last December for #331 million but the U.K. Monopolies and Mergers Commission ruled two weeks ago that a "small number" of the William Hill shops in London should be sold to prevent Grand Met from attaining "undue market power on an industrywide basis."
