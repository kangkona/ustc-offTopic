Mannesmann AG, a West German specialty-machinery and engineering group, agreed to take a 5% stake in TI Group PLC, of Britain. 

The move is part of a marketing pact aimed initially at expanding each firm's share of the other's home market.
TI, a specialized-engineering group with particular strengths in industrial seals and small-diameter tubing, said the two companies may use the new "strategic alliance" as a springboard for growth throughout Europe following the unification of European Community markets at the end of 1992. 

"I am delighted that Mannesmann, one of Germany's leading companies, is taking this equity position," said TI's chairman, Christopher Lewinton.
