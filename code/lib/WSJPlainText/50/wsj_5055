A former officer of Sealed Air Corp. was sentenced for embezzling $1.3 million of the company's money. 

George S. Shegog Jr., the company's former chief financial officer and treasurer, was sentenced to four years in prison by U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, who then suspended all but six months of the sentence. 

Mr. Shegog, 46 years old, was also fined $10,000.
Mr. Shegog spent all but $200,000 of the money for his own personal purposes, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Ralph J. Marra Jr. 

The money was diverted between October 1984 and June 1987, when Mr. Shegog left the company.
Mr. Shegog deposited the checks into two unauthorized bank accounts that he opened under the names of Sealed Air and a defunct Sealed Air subsidiary. 

The Saddle Brook, N.J.-based protective packaging company recovered all the missing funds as part of a settlement of a civil lawsuit it filed against Mr. Shegog.
