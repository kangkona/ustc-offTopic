Indiana's insurance department assumed operating control of Life of Indiana Insurance Co. in an effort to obtain a capital infusion for the health-insurance concern. 

Life of Indiana is the primary business unit of Life of Indiana Corp., which recently reported a $1.8 million loss for the second quarter.
The state said its preliminary examination of the unit's books disclosed a $1.5 million negative statutory net worth because of recent group health insurance losses. 

Under a procedure called rehabilitation, the state took over management of the unit while it determines whether to seek to revitalize it or to petition for its liquidation. 

"Our intention is to capitalize the company by any means we can," said Randy Lamberjack, assistant chief examiner. "We're hoping we can find a suitable investor within next 60 days."
