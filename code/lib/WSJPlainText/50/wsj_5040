The federal budget deficit narrowed to $22.15 billion in August from $23.08 billion a year earlier, the Treasury said.
The July deficit was $18.24 billion. 

So far in fiscal 1989, with just one more month to go, the deficit totals $145.92 billion, compared with $165.32 billion during the year-earlier period. 

The Bush administration has estimated the 1989 budget deficit to be just under $170 billion, while the Congressional Budget Office is looking for a deficit of $161 billion.
The deficit for all of fiscal 1988 was $155.1 billion. 

The government often shows a surplus in September from an influx of quarterly tax payments.
That's not likely this year because of large payments this month from the savings-and-loan bailout and other factors. 

In its monthly statement, the Treasury said receipts totaled $76.26 billion last month, up from $69.48 billion the year earlier and $66.26 billion in July.
Outlays totaled $98.41 billion, up from $92.56 billion the year earlier and $84.49 billion in the previous month. 

For the first 11 months of fiscal 1989, which began Oct. 1, government receipts totaled $892.37 billion, up from with $811.15 billion the year before.
Outlays through August totaled $1.038 trillion, up from $976.48 billion.
The government paid $17.33 billion in interest last month on the federal debt.
