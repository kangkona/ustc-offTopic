Chargeurs S.A. said group profit more than doubled in the first half of 1989, but warned that its second-half operating profit will come under pressure because of a strike at its airline unit in July and August. 

The Paris-based airline and textile holding company said unaudited figures showed first-half group earnings at 921 million francs ($140.4 million), up from 452 million francs a year earlier.
Group revenue rose 75% in the period to 10.47 billion francs from 5.98 billion, while operating profit climbed to 422 million francs from 302 million. 

Chargeurs said its first-half results were strongly influenced by one-time factors.
Among these were a nonrecurring gain of 692 million francs from the sale of its Spontex cleaning products unit. 

Partly offsetting this gain, the company had one-time restructuring charges of 128 million francs for some textile operations and 58 million francs of start-up costs for its 10% stake in a communications venture.
