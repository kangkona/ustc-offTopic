Temple Holdings Ltd. said it will seek to nominate a new slate of directors at the annual meeting of Sea Containers Ltd. in order to further Temple's $63-a-share, or $963 million, tender offer for Sea Containers. 

Temple, which is jointly owned by Stena Holdings AG in Sweden and Tiphook PLC in London, said it was "very disappointed" that Sea Containers has continued to reject the offer.
The annual meeting would provide holders with a "clear choice" between the offer and Sea Containers' recapitalization plan, Temple said. 

The holding company also said that, if Sea Containers didn't hold an annual meeting, it would "pursue all available remedies," including calling a special meeting, to remove the current directors. 

Sea Containers, a Hamilton, Bermuda, shipping concern, wouldn't comment.
