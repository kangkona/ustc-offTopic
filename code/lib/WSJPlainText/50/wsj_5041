Automobiles will be banned from circulating one day a week in the Valley of Mexico beginning in October as part of an experimental plan to reduce smog levels in the area, the Department of Urban Development and Ecology announced. 

The state petroleum monopoly Pemex will also extend distribution of premium gasoline, which burns more completely, and introduce unleaded ordinary gasoline as part of the plan, the department said. 

Mexico City and its suburbs in the valley, 7,250 feet above sea level, with 18 million people and three million vehicles circulating daily, is one of the world's smoggiest metropolitan areas. 

About 80% of the air pollution is caused by old-model badly tuned vehicles, which often use cheap gasoline and lack anti-contamination devices. 

The department estimated the plan will take about 450,000 vehicles out of circulation daily.
Inspectors will also keep a close eye on the valley's 35,000 industrial plants, about 5,000 of which are highly contaminating, the department said.
