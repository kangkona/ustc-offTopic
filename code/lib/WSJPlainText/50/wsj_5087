Western Europe's largest satellite-launching company doesn't regard Japan's attempt to develop its own launch capacity as a threat, its chairman said. 

Frederic d'Allest, chief executive officer of Arianespace Co., said Japan's efforts could benefit his company. 

"It isn't our intention to tell Japan not to build the H-2" satellite-launch rocket, Mr. d'Allest said. "Our stance is that we have a joint partnership.
Japan's perfecting its own technology will lead to our mutual benefit." 

Japan is developing the H-2, its next generation satellite-launch rocket, which could become a direct competitor with Arianespace's own satellite launchers. 

Until recently, Japan has relied primarily on foreign satellite technology.
With no large military to provide abundant orders for launch rockets, it was a latecomer to their development. 

But Japanese officials have begun to argue that it is important for Japan to develop its own launch capacity.
The nation has boosted its spending on space development, including research on the H-2. 

This has led to some fears that Japan will become the same kind of competitor in satellites that it has in steel, automobiles and home electronics. 

Mr. d'Allest said, "We aren't concerned whether the H-2 contains the world's most advanced technology.
Our concern is whether we can provide lifting services for the cheapest amount of money. 

"The future will tell whether the H-2 or the Ariane 5 {Arianespace's next-generation rocket} will be the cheaper technology," he added. 

Arianespace officials said they hope that if Japan's H-2 is a success, Japanese satellites still will be made compatible for liftoff on Ariane rockets as well.
This would enable the satellite owner to reduce risk in case of a mishap, they said. 

Arianespace, a closely held company registered in France, represents 10 European countries.
Since its founding in 1980, it has garnered more than 50% of the world market for commercial-satellite-launching rockets.
