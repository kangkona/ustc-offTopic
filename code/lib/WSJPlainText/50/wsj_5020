The Federal National Mortgage Association said the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs approved a 3-for-1 common stock split. 

Fannie Mae's warrants also will be split 3-for-1.
The warrants, which expire Feb. 25, 1990, entitle holders to buy one share of stock for each warrant at $14.75.
A spokesman said the additional shares and warrants will be mailed Oct. 16 to holders of record Oct. 2. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Fannie Mae common closed at $118.25, up $4, while the warrants closed at $74.875, up $3.50. 

The split, which was approved by directors last week, will leave Fannie Mae with 239 million shares of common stock outstanding and 34.5 million warrants. 

Fannie Mae, a federally chartered, stockholder owned corporation, operates a secondary market for home loans.
