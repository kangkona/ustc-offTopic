U.S. official reserve assets fell $1.1 billion in August to $62.36 billion, the Treasury Department said. 

Last month's drop compared with a $2.96 billion rise in reserve assets in July to $63.46 billion, the department said. 

U.S. reserve assets consist of foreign currencies, gold, special drawing rights at the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. reserve position -- its ability to draw foreign currencies -- at the IMF. 

The nation's holdings of foreign currencies dropped $588 million in August to $33.41 billion, while its gold reserves were unchanged at $11.07 billion. 

U.S. holdings of IMF special drawing rights last month fell $100 million to $9.24 billion, and its reserve position at the IMF dropped $411 million to $8.64 billion.
