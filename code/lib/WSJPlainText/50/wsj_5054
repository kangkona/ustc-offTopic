Drake Publications Inc., a New York magazine publisher, folded Venture, the monthly business magazine it has owned only since June. 

Arthur Lipper III, the investment banker and chairman of 10-year-old Venture, was told by Drake executives Friday that the magazine was suspending publication before publishing its October issue.
The move was expected. 

Mr. Lipper said Carl Ruderman, chairman of Drake, "admitted to me he cannot afford to go forward with Venture" and is seeking a buyer for the equity interest he acquired. 

Mr. Lipper, who sold Venture to Drake, said that while the magazine was closing, it could be resurrected with the help of new investors or owners. 

Drake executives didn't return several calls for comment.
A source at the magazine said the staff was assembled late Friday afternoon to be told the magazine would close. 

"I have had some calls today from people I haven't talked to in the past," said Mr. Lipper. "They are preliminary talks, but I believe there are a number of interested parties.
I am not giving up hope."
