The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. adopted its proposed "entrance" fee for savings and loan associations that want to convert to banks and be covered by the corporation's Bank Insurance Fund. 

The fee is 79 cents per $100 of insured deposits, but it will cost a thrift more than that to get a bank charter. 

The new savings and loan bailout law allows such switches, and a number of S&Ls wish to do so because the premiums of the Bank Insurance Fund are lower than those for the separate Savings Association Insurance Fund. 

But the law requires these thrifts to continue paying premiums to the savings association fund for five years.
After that, they must pay the new entrance fee to the bank fund and also an exit fee to the savings fund.
The exit fee hasn't yet been set.
