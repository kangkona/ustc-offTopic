Bank South Corp. said it contracted out its data-processing operations to International Business Machines Corp. as part of a cost-saving restructuring. 

Financial terms of the agreement weren't disclosed, but the companies said IBM will build, design and operate a new data center for the Atlanta-based bank holding company.
Bank South said the agreement is expected to result in substantial savings over a 10-year period. 

Earlier this month, Bank South said it planned to cut its work force by about 300 jobs as part of the restructuring.
