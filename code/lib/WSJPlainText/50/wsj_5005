Wang Laboratories Inc. said it completed a $175 million financing agreement with a unit of Manufacturers Hanover Corp. to provide working capital during a period of restructuring. 

The computer maker also said it expects revenue for the first quarter ending Sept. 30 will decline 10% to 13% from year-earlier levels.
The company also repeated that it will post a loss in the year's first half.
In the year ended June 30, Wang reported a $424.3 million loss on revenue of $3.03 billion. 

The financing agreement, with CIT Group/Business Credit Inc., is comprised of $120 million in revolving credit notes secured by domestic accounts receivable, and $55 million of term notes secured by certain real estate.
The revolving credit is subject to limitations common to asset-based lending agreements, Wang said. 

Richard W. Miller, president and chief operating officer, said the agreement, "together with the refinancing concluded last month . . . creates a financial foundation which will allow the company to complete its operational and asset restructuring." He said the company is proceeding with an effort to sell certain businesses and assets that are seen as being outside the company's core business. 

"Our business plan anticipates losses through the first half of fiscal 1990 and we are likely to incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to streamline operations," Mr. Miller said.
