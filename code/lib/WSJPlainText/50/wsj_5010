Pantera's Corp., Dallas, said it and its major units have filed for Chapter 11 protection in federal bankruptcy court in Dallas.
The company also said R.E. Smith has resigned as an officer, but would remain on the board and as an employee. 

Under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, a company continues to operate under protection from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its debts.
Pantera's reports secured debt of $4.1 million while its largest subsidiary, the Pizza Inn restaurant chain, has secured debt of more than $30 million.
The company also failed to pay interest due Sept. 1. 

Pantera's reported a loss of $4 million for the first three quarters of this fiscal year, and has yet to report earnings for the quarter that ended June 30. 

The company didn't say what position Mr. Smith held, but his resignation follows last week's departures of the chairman and chief executive officer, a vice chairman and a third board member.
Mr. Smith was president of Pantera's last year.
