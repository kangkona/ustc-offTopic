Telemundo Group Inc., a Spanish-language broadcaster based in New York, said it completed the sale of three million shares of newly issued common stock to Reliance Insurance Co. for $15 million. 

That sale follows the $15 million sale in August of three million shares to Liberty Service Corp., a unit of Columbia Savings & Loan Association, Beverly Hills, Calif. 

Reliance Insurance is a subsidiary of Saul P. Steinberg's Reliance Group Holdings Inc. Reliance Insurance along with Reliance Capital Group L.P., an affiliate of Reliance Group Holdings, hold 65% of Telemundo's 22.8 million shares outstanding.
The Columbia Savings unit owns 17.3%. 

In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Telemundo closed $5.50, up 25 cents. 

Telemundo said proceeds will be used to reduce its debt and for working capital.
