First Ameri-Cable Corp. said an affiliate of Tele-Communications Inc. has agreed to buy all of its stock for about $40 million. 

Specific terms are incomplete.
The per-share purchase price will be partially determined by the number of subscribers First Ameri-Cable has when the transaction is closed in the first quarter of 1990. 

The company now has about 18,500 subscribers, but expects that to climb to about 20,000 in the six states where it operates cable television systems. 

Tele-Communications, based in Denver, is a cable TV operator.
