Vitro S.A. said it extended for a third time its $20-a-share tender offer for Anchor Glass Container Corp., Tampa., Fla.
The latest extension expires on Thursday. 

Vitro said that 8,594,324 Anchor common shares have been tendered to date.
Together with the 1,430,300 shares already owned by Vitro, the company said the total represents 72% of Anchor's outstanding common stock. 

Since August, Anchor, a maker of bottles and glass containers, has been fighting Vitro's takeover bid, which is believed to be the first by a Mexican firm directed at a U.S. company.
