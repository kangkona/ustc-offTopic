NCNB Corp. said it agreed with a group of underwriters on a $400 million public offering of 20-year subordinated notes. 

The announcement came just two days after the bank holding company agreed to make a public offering of five million new common shares in Japan, which is expected to raise about $250 million. 

NCNB said the debt issue may be used, among other things, to reduce existing debt, to add to working capital and to acquire other financial institutions. 

Analysts said NCNB has made no secret of its desire to buy thrifts and small banks. "It's reasonable to assume they'll be looking first and foremost in Texas and Florida," said Henry J. Coffey Jr., an analyst at J.C. Bradford & Co. in Nashville, Tenn. 

The underwriting syndicate for the debt issue is co-managed by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, Morgan Stanley & Co. and Nomura Securities International Inc. Closing is scheduled for Sept. 27.
