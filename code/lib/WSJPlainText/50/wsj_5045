The Communications Workers of America rejected a tentative contract agreement with Pacific Telesis Group, sending negotiators back to the bargaining table. 

Union officials, who called the rejection vote "overwhelming," met over the weekend to identify provisions that will be renegotiated.
The CWA representative and the regional telephone company had reached a tentative agreement a month ago, ending a three-week strike. 

The CWA represents about 42,000 Pacific Telesis employees in California and Nevada. 

A spokeswoman said Pacific Telesis doesn't anticipate another strike and expected to return to the bargaining table soon.
The union had raised concerns about health benefits, job relocations, job security and differences in pay between urban and rural areas.
