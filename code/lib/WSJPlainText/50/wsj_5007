Central Realty Investors Inc. said its second takeover bid, valued at about $105 million, for Major Realty Corp. was rejected by Major Realty's board of directors. 

But Central Realty, a real-estate investment trust, said it would continue to press its offer. 

In mid-September, Central Realty offered Major Realty shareholders $7 in cash and $7.50 of convertible preferred stock for each common share held.
In June, Central Realty had made an initial offer of $13.50 a share, or about $98.5 million.
In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Major Realty closed unchanged at $12.875 a share. 

At the time of Central Realty's initial offer, Major Realty said it would proceed with a plan to merge with a unit of Stoneridge Resources Inc., a holding company in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.
The plan gives Major Realty holders the option to receive $13.50 in cash for each common share held, or to keep their stock. 

On Friday, Central Realty President John A. Murphy said in a letter to Major Realty's board of directors that Central Realty's directors were "dumbfounded" at Major Realty's "lack of sensitivity to shareholder and employee interests." 

Mr. Murphy said Central Realty wouldn't withdraw its offer.
He also asked for a list of Major Realty shareholders so that Central Realty could present its proposal directly to shareholders before they vote Oct. 6 on the recommendation by Major Realty's board. 

A Stoneridge spokeswoman said: "Central Realty's rejection means Major Realty is supporting us.
Obviously we're very happy with that." She declined to comment on Central Realty's intention to stay in the bidding. 

Executives at Major Realty couldn't be reached to comment.
