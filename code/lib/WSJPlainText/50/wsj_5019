Ecogen Inc., Langhorne, Pa., said it obtained marketing approval from the Environmental Protection Agency for two bioinsecticides. 

The biotechnology company said the EPA registered Cutlass, for controlling caterpillar damage to leafy vegetables, and Condor, for preventing defoliation of trees by the gypsy moth and spruce budworm caterpillars. 

Both products employ genetically modified strains of Bacillus thuringiensis, a naturally occurring bacterium that produces a protein byproduct fatal to caterpillars.
