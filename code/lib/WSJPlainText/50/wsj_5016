National Bank of Canada's net income for the year ending Oct. 31 "will be between 2.10 and 2.20 Canadian dollars {$1.78 and $1.86} a share and the outlook for {fiscal} 1990 is very positive," Andre Berard, president and chief executive, said. 

National Bank of Canada had fiscal 1988 net income of C$226.3 million, or C$1.87 a share. 

Net income for the nine months ended July 31 was C$208.7 million, or C$1.63 a share, compared with C$159.2 million, or C$1.32 a share, a year earlier.
Mr. Berard's estimate of fiscal 1989 earnings indicates the bank expects to report net of 47 to 57 Canadian cents a share for the current fourth quarter.
Year-earlier fourth quarter net was C$67 million, or 55 Canadian cents a share. 

Mr. Berard said the Canadian economy is slowing down, but he doesn't expect a full-blown recession. "I think we will have a more pronounced slowdown than anticipated," Mr. Berard said. "I think during the 'soft landing' here the wheels will squeal a little bit more than expected." 

But an economic slowdown in Canada won't have a major impact on National Bank of Canada, Mr. Berard said. 

"I don't see a marked reduction in the bank's profits even if we have a major economic slowdown," he said.
He said that Quebec, and Quebec companies, are better prepared than in the past to minimize the consequences of a slowdown.
Despite National Bank's geographic concentration -- it is the dominant chartered bank in Quebec -- the bank's deposit base and borrowers are diversified and "they can't all go bad at once," Mr. Berard said. 

Montreal-based National Bank of Canada is the smallest of Canada's so-called Big Six banks, with assets of C$33.25 billion as of July 31, about half the assets held by the fifth-largest bank, Toronto-Dominion.
