Outboard Marine Corp., Waukegan, Ill., said it expects to post a charge of about $3.8 million, or 20 cents a share, for its fiscal fourth quarter related to its decision to stop making outboard motors at its Canadian plant. 

The marine-products concern said it will lay off about 290 workers at the facility in Peterborough, Ontario, in early 1990 as part of the decision.
Currently, there are about 450 employees at the plant. 

In the year-earlier fourth quarter, ended Sept. 30, 1988, Outboard Marine earned $21.3 million, or $1.11 a share, on sales of $479.7 million. 

Outboard said the move is part of a continuing program to "improve manufacturing efficiencies and better utilize its world-wide facilities." 

The company said it will continue its marketing, sales, service, parts and accessories, and administrative operations in Peterborough.
