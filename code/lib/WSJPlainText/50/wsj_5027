Solvay & Cie., Belgium's largest chemical concern, said consolidated group earnings for the first six months of 1989 increased 12% from a year earlier, to 8.33 billion Belgian francs ($204.8 million) from 7.44 billion francs. 

Sales increased 7% to 139.89 billion francs from 130.71 billion francs.
Solvay said that based on first-half earnings, consolidated net income for the year should exceed that of 1988. 

Solvay said the increased sales "reflect the very good economic climate which has stimulated the chemical sector since 1987." 

The company said the increased earnings were due both to strong performance in some of the group's five key divisions as well as a decrease in extraordinary charges. 

Solvay's earnings were "about in line with market expectations," said Luc Van Den Brande, a trader at Peterbroeck, Van Campenhout & Cie.
