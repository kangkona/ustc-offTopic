Generale d'Electricite said its group profit after payments to minority interests nearly tripled in the first half, partly as a result of accounting changes linked to the creation of its joint venture with General Electric Co. of Britain. 

The French electronics group said the group profit jumped to 2.59 billion francs ($395.2 million) in the first half from 875 million francs a year earlier.
It noted, however, that the gain partly reflected one billion francs of nonoperating income from a change in accounting methods linked to the creation of a joint power engineering unit and the absorption of its Alsthom S.A. engineering unit. 

CGE said group revenue rose 16% in the first half to 67.17 billion francs from 57.97 billion a year earlier.
Profit from current operations rose 62% over the same period to 2.1 billion francs from 1.3 billion.
CGE said this gain was based on "improved profitability from all operations."
