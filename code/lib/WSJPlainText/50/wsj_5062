Japanese shipbuilders, encouraged by a recent recovery in the industry, said they agreed to end an anti-recession cartel they formed in 1987. 

The agreement to dismantle the cartel at the end of September came at a meeting of the steering committee of the Shipbuilders' Association of Japan. 

Association officials said the group relayed the decision to the government's Fair Trade Commission, which has been considering whether to allow the shipbuilders to keep the cartel in force. 

Japan shipbuilders had been faltering because of the inroads of competitors from other Asian countries, and because of the yen's sharp appreciation that made it more expensive for foreign shipowners to have vessels built in Japan. 

But the economies of the U.S. and other major industrial countries have continued to expand, and led to the recovery in the shipping and shipbuilding industries. 

The Japan Ship Exporters' Association said export contracts for 20 ships weighing 380,250 gross tons were signed in August, up 2.7% from a year ago.
