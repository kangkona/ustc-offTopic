PHONE WARS: MCI Communications Corp. starts a TV campaign today during Monday Night Football emphasizing customer satisfaction and claiming "Every week, 100,000 AT&T customers switch to MCI." It said the figure was supplied by an independent research company, which it declined to name.
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. took issue with the claim.
If customers were switching at that rate, MCI "in two years would have every business account in America," AT&T said.
