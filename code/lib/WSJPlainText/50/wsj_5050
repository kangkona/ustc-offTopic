Manufacturers Hanover Corp. said its international-leasing subsidiary sold its 45% interest in Korea Industrial Leasing Co. to Nippon Credit Bank Ltd., Tokyo, for $68 million. 

Manufacturers Hanover said it expects a $15 million after-tax gain on the sale of its share in the equipment-leasing company, which is based in Seoul.
In a statement, the New York bank-holding company said the sale "reflects Manufacturers Hanover's strategic decision to divest most of its international-leasing businesses in order to redirect additional resources to business {financing} activities in the U.S." Manufacturers Hanover said the sale doesn't affect the company's other banking activities in South Korea. 

Other investors in Korea Industrial Leasing, which listed assets of $800 million as of Dec. 31, include Korea Development Bank with 50% and Korea Exchange Bank with 5%.
