Your Aug. 29 article "Under Bush, a Band of Reaganites Continues Fight to Slash Funds for Legal Aid to the Poor" could not have had a more misleading headline.
As the article mentioned, the Legal Services Corp. has, since its creation in 1974, misappropriated funds earmarked for the poor and used them to finance left-wing political causes. 

The Reaganites on the LSC board have sought to increase legal aid to the poor by stopping this misappropriation.
The LSC should be more appropriately named the "Left-Wing Services Corp." because of this gross abuse of taxpayers' funds.
Worse, however, is the fact that conservative activists now have their snouts in the LSC trough and are misappropriating LSC funds for their own pet causes. 

What's needed is a legal-services voucher to eliminate the need for politically motivated legal-services middlemen, both liberal and conservative.
