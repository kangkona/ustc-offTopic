Technodyne Inc. is to be delisted from the American Stock Exchange because it no longer meets the exchange's financial requirements. 

A spokesman for Technodyne said that among the reasons for the delisting is that the distributor of non-prescription pharmaceuticals has been unprofitable for the past three years.
The company's Action Drug Co. subsidiary filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection last month. 

An Amex spokeswoman said that the exchange takes a number of factors into account, but it "will consider delisting" when a company has posted losses for three of the past four years and its shareholder equity is less than $4 million. 

Common shares of Technodyne will continue to trade on the Boston Stock Exchange under the symbol TND.B and on the over-the-counter market.
