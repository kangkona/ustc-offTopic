An affiliate of Calgary-based PWA Corp. said it ordered eight turboprop aircraft from Avions de Transport Regional, a French-Italian consortium, for 100 million Canadian dollars (US$84.6 million). 

Ontario Express Ltd., a regional airline whose routes are mainly in Ontario, said deliveries are scheduled to begin by 1992.
Ontario Express is 49%-owned by PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines International Ltd., Canada's second-largest airline. 

Avions de Transport Regional is owned by France's state-owned Aerospatiale S.A., and Aeritalia, an Italian aviation concern.
