Communications Systems Inc. said hurricane damage to its main manufacturing plant in Puerto Rico is likely to have "a considerable impact" on third-quarter operating results. 

Hurricane Hugo damaged buildings, grounds and raw materials at its Puerto Rican subsidiary, Suttle Caribe, the company said.
The plant accounts for about 70% of CSI's telephone station apparatus shipments. 

The company said it hopes to resume normal operations within a few days.
