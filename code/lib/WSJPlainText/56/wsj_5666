Sony Corp. of Japan said the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment cleared its Sony USA Inc. unit to proceed with a $14-a-share, $60 million offer to buy Materials Research Corp. 

The federal committee reviews foreign takeovers to determine if U.S. national security would be threatened by the transaction. 

Materials Research, based in Orangeburg, N.Y., makes semiconductor-coating and etching equipment, high-purity metals and ceramics.
Sony is a maker of consumer and industrial audio and video electronics, computer peripherals and semiconductors. 

The offer, made through Sony MRC Acquisition Corp., was scheduled to expire at midnight last night.
