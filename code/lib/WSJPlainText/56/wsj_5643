Diamond Shamrock R&M Inc. said it completed the acquisition of a hydrocarbon-storage company and related trading company from Belvieu Enterprises Co., Houston, for an undisclosed cash sum. 

Diamond Shamrock said the purchase of XRAL Storage & Terminaling Co. and XCEL Products Co. will bring to 25 the number of underground-storage wells it has in the Mont Belvieu area near Houston.
The wells have a capacity of nearly 60 million barrels of hydrocarbons, it said.
