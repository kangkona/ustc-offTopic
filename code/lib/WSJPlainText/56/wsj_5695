The International Monetary Fund approved a $53.3 million loan to Gabon to support economic and financial changes in the African oil-exporting country. 

The IMF loan will be disbursed in installments during the next 18 months. 

Gabon's agreement calls for action by the country to revive growth in the non-oil sector of its economy, adoption of a restrictive domestic-credit policy and reductions in Gabon's international-payments deficit during the 1989-1990 period. 

In other action, the IMF cleared a $25.5 million loan to Laos, to support structural economic adjustments in the Southeast Asian country during the next three years. 

The IMF said the borrower, formally known as the Lao People's Democratic Republic, since 1985 has been shifting its economy away from central planning to give the private sector a greater role in production, trade and other developments.
Foreign-exchange restrictions also have been eased, the agency said. 

Separately, the IMF cleared a $26 million loan to Haiti.
The loan will be disbursed in installments during the next 15 months to support the Caribbean country's economic changes.
