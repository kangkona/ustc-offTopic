Kroger Co., Cincinnati, estimated that its identical store sales and operating cash flow from continuing units for the third quarter were ahead of the year-ago quarter. 

In last year's third quarter, Kroger earned $56.2 million, or 65 cents a share, on sales of $5.58 billion. 

William J. Sinkula, the supermarket chain's chief financial officer, said results for the first 13 weeks of the 16-week quarter indicate strong sales momentum and expense control accomplished in the first half of the year. 

He said sales from identical stores are running more than 5% ahead of the year-ago quarter's performance, and operating cash flow for the quarter is expected to be at least 20% ahead of the $197 million generated the year earlier.
Results for the latest quarter will be released Oct. 16.
