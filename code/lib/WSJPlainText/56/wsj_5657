In a notice to the London Stock Exchange, Saatchi & Saatchi PLC disclosed that U.S. investment-management concern Southeastern Asset Management Inc. boosted its holding in the world's largest advertising and communications group to 10.2% from 9.4%. 

Memphis, Tenn.-based Southeastern became Saatchi's largest shareholder just two weeks ago when it picked up about 14.9 million shares represented by American depositary receipts, or ADRs.
Southeastern's total holding in Saatchi now stands at 16.1 million shares. 

The move also follows Southeastern's purchase last week of a 7.16% holding in Blue Arrow PLC, the world's largest employment services concern. 

At midafternoon yesterday, Saatchi shares were up three pence at 319 pence on the London Stock Exchange.
