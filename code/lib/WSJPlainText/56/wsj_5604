Boeing Co. said its Boeing Commercial Airplanes unit received orders from AirMalta for three 737-500 jetliners, valued at about $90 million including spare parts, and secured options on three more of the twin-jets. 

AirMalta, the national flag carrier of the Mediterranean island republic of Malta, will get its first 737-500 in June 1993.
The aircraft will seat about 125 passengers in a single-class configuration, and will be powered by CFM56-3C engines made by CFM International, a venture of General Electric Co. and Snecma of France. 

AirMalta may change the order to 737-300s or 737-400s at a later date, Boeing said.
The order brings Seattle-based Boeing's total 737 orders to 2,637 aircraft.
