The news that troubled Campeau Corp. will get a cash infusion from Canada's Olympia & York Development Inc. helped to spark a spirited rally in the junk bond market. 

Campeau said Olympia & York agreed to provide a $250 million loan, enough to tide over Campeau while it restructures, and enabling its Federated and Allied department stores to meet payments to suppliers and creditors. 

Although junk bond prices were higher across the board, the so-called "high quality" junk bonds picked up the biggest gains, with some rising as many as three points, or about $30 for each $1,000 face amount.
While those are impressive gains, they represent only a portion of the market's loses from last week when junk issues fell about five points. 

The high-yield bond market was thrown into turmoil last week when Campeau disclosed it was running short of cash.
But, "at least for now, the downward pressure on prices appears to have subsided," said Frank V. Colombo, director of high-yield research at Dillon Read & Co.
The biggest gainers, he said, were companies such as RJR Holdings, Kroger and Quantum Chemicals, which are considered among the financially stronger junk bond issuers. 

The Campeau announcement triggered price gains in the bonds of other retailers as well, including R.H. Macy & Co., whose 14 1/2% subordinated debentures due 2001 traded late at 101, up about two points. 

RJR Holdings' 14.7% convertible pay-in-kind securities maturing in 2009 jumped 3 1/2 to close at 99 while Kroger's 12 7/8% senior subordinated debentures due 1999 rose one point to 104. 

The bonds of Campeau's Federated unit, among the worse hit in last week's sell off, recouped some loses but remain at extremely low levels.
Federated's 16% senior subordinated debentures due 2000 were bid at 61 yesterday after being quoted in the mid-50s late last week. 

"The Campeau news certainly helped, but we reached a point where many bargain hunters believed prices had hit the bottom," said Peter Avelar, portfolio manager of the PaineWebber High Yield Bond Fund.
He said: "The sellers have been forced out already," including some large junk bond mutual funds that sold portions of their holdings last week to raise cash to meet redemption needs. 

As the junk bond market gained momentum, some potential buyers complained of a growing scarcity of supply.
Said one money manager: "The illiquidity on the upside is as bad as the illiquidity on the down side." 

It was a busy day for bonds in other markets as well.
In the municipal market, more than $1 billion of new tax-exempt notes and bonds were issued yesterday.
Treasury prices, after rising in early trading, ended narrowly mixed.
Mortgage-backed securities gained 1/32 to 2/32. 

Meanwhile, the World Bank's $1.5 billion debut in the federal agency debt market "was several times oversubscribed, easily," according to World Bank Treasurer Don Roth. 

The 10-year global bonds, a new type of security that will be denominated in dollars and traded globally on a 24-hour basis, were priced at 8 3/8% at 99.55 to yield 8.44%.
The yield was about .375 percentage point above the outstanding 10-year Treasury note, tighter than some traders had expected.
When secondary trading began, the notes traded at a premium, another sign of strong demand. 

The offering was made simultaneously in the U.S. and Europe through an international syndicate led by Salomon Brothers Inc. and Deutsche Bank Capital Markets Ltd. 

Treasury, Agency Securities 

Treasurys ended narrowly mixed after retracing earlier gains. 

Bond prices moved higher yesterday morning after the Department of Labor reported better-than-expected inflation statistics and lower-than-expected housing starts data. 

"The news was bullish for the market," said James Capra, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.
But Treasury bonds fell later in the day as dealers began selling Treasury securities in an effort to hedge against the World Bank's $1.5 billion 10-year notes offering. 

The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was quoted late at a price of 100 9/32 to yield 8.09% compared with 100 10/32 to yield 8.085% Monday.
The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 99 10/32 to yield 8.08% compared with 99 09/32 to yield 8.086% Monday. 

Short-term interest rates rose slightly.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was quoted at 7.73% for a bond equivalent yield of 7.97% while the rate on six-month Treasury bills was 7.68% for a yield of 8.08%. 

Elsewhere, Financing Corp. said it accepted a bid from Salomon Brothers Inc. to purchase $665 million of 8.60% 30-year bonds at a weighted price of 99.698 and a weighted yield of 8.628%. 

Looking ahead, analysts said they don't expect any surprises in today's release of the Federal Reserve's latest edition of the so-called "Tan Book." 

The Tan Book is an official summary of the economic reports by the Fed's 12 district banks that is prepared before a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.
The Fed's policy-making arm will next convene on Oct. 3. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities 

Mortgage securities ended another quiet session with gains of 1/32 to 2/32. 

Trading was light in both the passthrough sector and the derivative securities market, which had been active during the past week because of heavy issuance of real estate mortgage investment conduits. 

Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for October delivery ended at 97 25/32, up 2/32; 9 1/2% securities at 99 27/32, up 2/32; and Federal Home Loan Mortage Corp. 9% securities at 96 29/32, up 1/32. 

The Ginnie Mae 9s were yielding 9.44% as the spread above the 10-year Treasury note held at 1.37 percentage points.
The 10-year note was up about 3/32 at 99 15/32. 

Municipals 

Swamped by the pricing of more than $1 billion in new long-term issues, municipal bonds posted session losses of as much as 7/8 point and were markedly underperforming U.S. Treasurys. 

Symptomatic of the underperformance, December municipal futures slipped 15/32 to 92 3/32, while December T-bond futures lost only 2/32 to end the afternoon session at 97 8/32. 

A two-part Dormitory Authority of the State of New York borrowing, totaling more than $874 million, dominated the long-term arena yesterday.
Lazard Freres & Co. was the lead underwriter. 

The offering includes about $692.1 million of State University Educational Facilities revenue bonds priced to yield from 6.3% in 1991 to 7.52% in 2015.
There were also $182.2 million of special obligation bonds due 1989, priced to yield from 5.9% in 1990 to 7% in 2003-2007. 

In the secondary market, New Jersey Turnpike Authority 7.2% issue of 2018 was locked at 97 1/8, down 3/8 on the bid side and yielding about 7.44%.
Late Monday, the bonds were quoted at 97 1/2 to 97 3/4, where they yielded about 7.39%. 

Foreign Bonds 

Helped by profit-taking on short positions, the Japanese government bond market ended firmer Tuesday. 

Some Japanese institutional investors closed their short positions in the futures market to take profits after recent declines, according to traders.
In a short sale, dealers sell borrowed securities and later seek to make a profit by buying the securities back a lower price to replace what was borrowed. 

As a result, Japan's benchmark No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers' screens at 95.75, up 0.43.
The yield fell to 5.31%. 

However, this rebound is just a temporary recovery, said one dealer, echoing bearish sentiment expressed by other participants recently.
Either the yen will weaken further, as many analysts believe, or the Bank of Japan will boost interest rates to defend the yen as well as quell domestic inflationary pressures.
In either case, the yen bond market will weaken, the dealer said. 

Elsewhere: 

-- In London, prices of British government bonds ended slightly lower.
Britain's benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 fell 6/32 to 113 17/32 to yield 9.88% while the Treasury's 11 3/4% notes due 1991 were unchanged at 99 10/32 to yield 12.26%. 

-- West German government bonds ended as much as 0.30 point higher.
Bonn's 6 3/4% bond due June 1999 ended 0.15 point higher at 98.90 to yield 6.90% while the 6 3/4% notes due 1994 are up the same amount at 98.775 and yield 7.05%.
