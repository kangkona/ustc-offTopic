Norton Co. said it fired its director of advanced-ceramics research, alleging he stole trade secrets. 

In a brief statement, the company said it filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Boston against its former manager, Chien-Min Sung, "charging him with misappropriation of trade secrets and other proprietary information for his own benefit and the benefit of other parties." General Electric Co., Mr. Sung's former employer, joined Norton in filing the suit against Mr. Sung and also alleges that he stole trade secrets, Norton said. 

Norton added that a "legal investigation" is under way on the matter but declined to elaborate on it.
A company spokesman said no criminal charges have been filed against Mr. Sung. 

Mr. Sung, reached at home, said: "The charges have no grounds.
They say I had some proprietary documents of theirs at home.
I had to bring some documents home related to my work but they have them now.
I don't know why they are bringing these charges." 

Norton hired Mr. Sung, an expert in synthetic-diamond research, in 1984.
He formerly worked at a Norton facility in Utah in research on industrial diamonds and was recently moved to Massachusetts to oversee advanced-ceramics research.
Mr. Sung said he also was involved in diamond research at GE. 

Norton makes sandpaper and other abrasives, diamond tools, specialty plastics and ceramics.
The company's advanced-ceramics business conducts research on ceramic engine components, military armor made with ceramics and other ceramic products.
