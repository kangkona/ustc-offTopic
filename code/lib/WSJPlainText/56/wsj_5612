Frank B. Hall & Co., Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., said it entered into a definitive agreement to sell one million new convertible preferred shares to its largest shareholder, Reliance Group Holdings Inc., for $50 million. 

The insurance brokerage firm said its audit committee approved issuance of the shares without shareholder approval under an exception to New York Stock Exchange rules; the exception permits such action when delay would "seriously jeopardize the financial viability of the enterprise." 

Donald Bell, chairman and chief executive officer, said the funds would strengthen Hall's financial position and provide working capital. 

About 74% of Hall is held by Reliance Group, controlled by Saul Steinberg.
Hall in August reported a second-quarter loss of $60.8 million, largely because of charges related to discontinued operations. 

Dividends on the preferred may be paid in Hall common, an option that will be used for the "foreseeable future," Hall said.
