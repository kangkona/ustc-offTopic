MLX Corp. filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering $120 million of long-term, senior subordinated notes and warrants to acquire some of its own common stock. 

The company said it plans to use the proceeds of the offering, combined with certain other new credit facilities, to pay substantially all of the outstanding indebtedness of its operating subsidiaries.
As a result, MLX would acquire the outstanding minority interests in its two principal operating subsidiaries. 

MLX also said it has made a formal request to its lenders to reschedule a $21.1 million payment due Sept. 30.
The company said it has asked that the payment be moved back to Dec. 15, and that it expects to reach agreement on the new terms by Sept. 30. 

MLX makes equipment for aircraft and heavy-duty vehicles.
