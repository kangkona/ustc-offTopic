Two of three European companies linked by the Italian news media to a scandal surrounding unauthorized lending by Banca Nazionale del Lavoro's Atlanta branch denied any wrongdoing, while a third declined to comment. 

A spokesman for Creusot Loire Industrie S.A. denied the French maker of armor plate has done business with BNL. Creusot Loire, along with West Germany's Thyssen AG and Britain's Ferranti International Signal PLC were named in the report as being under investigation by the Italian secret service.
The secret service declined to comment on the report. 

A Thyssen spokesman said that earlier this year, the company had to deliver some spare parts -- worth less than $10 million -- for a petrochemical plant in Basra, Iraq.
The transaction was guaranteed by the Central Bank of Iraq, which obtained a counterguarantee from BNL's Atlanta branch.
The plant was built several years ago by Thyssen Rheinstahl Technik, a Thyssen unit, and Lummus Crest Inc. 

"We have delivered the parts and we've got our money," said the spokesman. "That's all" Thyssen had to do with BNL Atlanta, he said, adding, "It was completely normal business; nothing to do with weapons." 

In London, a Ferranti spokesman declined to comment on whether BNL provided commercial guarantees for a Ferranti weapons contract to Iraq.
He added that his company uses "many, many banks" in financing its various international-defense contracts.
He denied that any BNL guarantees are involved in Ferranti's current problems.
Ferranti has indefinitely suspended its stock-trading in London pending an internal audit on "significant irregularities" in certain of its overseas defense contracts.
