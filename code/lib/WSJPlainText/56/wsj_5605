Cognos Inc., Ottawa, a computer software company, said it would post a fiscal second-quarter pretax loss of about 1.5 million Canadian dollars (US$1.3 million) and announced a restructuring of its senior management. 

The company said Thomas Csathy, its president and chief operating officer since 1986, has resigned "to pursue other interests." Michael Potter, the company's chief executive officer, has taken on the additional post as president.
Mr. Csathy couldn't be reached for comment. 

Cognos said the C$1.5 million pretax loss for the second quarter ended Aug. 31 didn't include the costs of restructuring management, which included the reassignment of some managers.
Mr. Potter estimated the restructuring costs would double the pretax loss for the quarter. 

Cognos went into the red in its first quarter, mainly because of a decline in sales.
The company estimated its second-quarter sales at C$29 million, up from C$24.4 million a year earlier.
Full second-quarter results are expected to be released next Tuesday.
