UtiliCorp United Inc. said its earnings for the third quarter are expected to rise 9.7% to $11.3 million, or 45 cents a share, from $10.3 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier. 

Revenue should increase 6.7% to $143 million from $134 million, the Kansas City, Mo., utility holding company said. 

The company said its average common shares outstanding increased to 20.8 million from 19.7 million in the third quarter of 1988.
The increase is primarily due to a public offering of two million new common shares in August 1988.
In addition, UtiliCorp said that dividends on the convertible preference stock issued in May reduced third-quarter earnings per common share. 

For the nine-month period, the company said it expects to earn $34.4 million, or $1.48 a share, up 14% from $30.1 million, or $1.49 a share.
Revenue is expected to rise 23%, to $497 million from $486 million. 

The company said that the third quarter reflects milder summer temperatures in the Midwestern region compared with the previous two years. 

The company's shares closed yesterday at $19.625, off 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
