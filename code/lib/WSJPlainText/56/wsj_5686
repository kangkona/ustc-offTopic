Iroquois Brands Ltd. said it agreed to sell the assets of its Schiff Products subsidiary to Weider Health & Fitness of Woodland Hills, Calif., for $8.2 million. 

The sale, which will result in a $4.8 million pretax loss, reflects the company's plan to change its business to industrial products from vitamins and pharmaceutical products, Iroquois said.
Proceeds will be used to further that strategy.
