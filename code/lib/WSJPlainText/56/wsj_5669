Sony Corp. said it plans to build a magnetic-tape-coating plant in France. 

Officials at Sony, Tokyo, said the new facility will be established in Dax-Pontonx in southern France at a cost of 500 million francs ($75.4 million). 

The plant will make coated-magnetic tapes to be supplied to the three tape-product plants Sony maintains in Europe -- two in France and one in Italy. 

Construction will start early in 1990, with production scheduled to get under way in the spring of 1991.
The new plant will employ about 100 people. 

The Western European plants have acquired tape material from Sony plants in Japan and the U.S.
But because of Sony's rapid expansion in the magnetic-tape markets in Europe, production has reached a scale that justifies the establishment of a coating facility there, officials say.
