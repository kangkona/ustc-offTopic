Action Auto Rental Inc., Cleveland, said it expects flat per-share earnings for the third quarter and second half. 

In the 1988 third quarter, earnings were $1.8 million, or 20 cents a share, on revenue of $17.3 million.
Second-half per-share net income last year was 41 cents. 

Action Auto said profit has been hurt by higher operating costs, mainly from increased liability and collision insurance claims.
