Ford Motor Co. said it is recalling about 67,000 of its 1988 model Tracers because of a problem involving front seat belts.
In some cases, seat belts may be difficult to extend for buckling or impossible to pull out. 

A Ford spokesman said the auto maker isn't aware of any injuries caused by the defective seat belts.
The company said it will ask owners to return their cars to dealers if they have been having trouble pulling out their front seat belt.
