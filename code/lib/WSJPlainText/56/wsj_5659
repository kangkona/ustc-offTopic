Italy's public sector deficit narrowed to 56.6 trillion lire ($40.07 billion) in the first seven months of the year from a revised 64.899 trillion lire ($45.96 billion) deficit in the year-earlier period, the Treasury announced. 

The year-earlier deficit was revised from the original estimate of 65.039 trillion lire. 

The narrowing of the deficit was due to a new rule that self-employed taxpayers have to pay 40% of their expected tax liability for the year by the end of May.
The rule was implemented for the first time this year.
In addition, tax collection in general has been higher than expected. 

The government has projected that the deficit for all of 1989 will reach 133 trillion lire, down only marginally from 134 trillion lire in 1988.
