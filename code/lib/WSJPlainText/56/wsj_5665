Seiyu Ltd., a major Japanese department store chain, said it agreed to buy 40% of Hong Kong's Wing On Department Stores (Bermuda) Ltd., a subsidiary of Wing On Co. 

Seiyu said that it expects to pay the equivalent of approximately seven billion yen ($47 million) for its stake in the Hong Kong department store operator, subject to final negotiations with Wing On, also of Hong Kong. 

Seiyu said that buying the stake in the Wing On subsidiary is part of a broad agreement to form a partnership.
It said the companies agreed to form a partnership as Wing On is seeking to expand its business, while Seiyu is seeking to develop a world-wide network.
