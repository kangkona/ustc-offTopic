Kroger Co. said it signed a pact to sell its Heartland Farms Dairy in Hazelwood, Mo., to Schnuck Markets Inc., a closely held St. Louis food store chain. 

Terms weren't disclosed. 

The sale is part of Kroger's previously announced plan to sell 11 of its food manufacturing plants as part of a corporate restructuring.
The operator of grocery stores expects the sale of those plants to result in an after-tax gain of about $260 million.
