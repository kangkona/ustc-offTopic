Smith Corona Corp., New Canaan, Conn., said it intends to "vigorously defend" itself against a patent- and copyright-infringement lawsuit brought against it by Franklin Computer Corp., Mount Holly, N.J. 

The Franklin suit, reported earlier, alleges that two electronic spelling machines made by Smith Cornona violate patents and copyrights on Franklin's hand-held spellers, which appeared in the market several years before Smith Corona's models. 

In a statement, Smith Corona said the technology in its spelling machines is "directly derived from the spelling technology used in Smith Corona's typewriters which were introduced long before any Franklin spelling devices existed in the market." 

Smith Corona didn't comment on Franklin's charge that it is falsely advertising its spelling-only devices as "dictionaries."
