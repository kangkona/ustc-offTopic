Cognex Corp. said it entered into a four-year agreement to sell machine-vision systems to Komatsu Ltd. of Japan. 

Machine-vision computer systems are used to replace human vision in manufacturing processes. 

Under the agreement, Tokyo-based Komatsu will buy from Cognex all machine-vision systems required for use in vision products to be developed both for the Japanese company's internal use and for sale to others.
Komatsu makes heavy equipment used in construction. 

Terms weren't disclosed, but Cognex said it expects the multimillion-dollar partnership agreement to help it reach new machine-vision markets in Japan. 

Komatsu initially will use the Cognex systems to develop products to perform such tasks as reading and inspection in industrial applications.
