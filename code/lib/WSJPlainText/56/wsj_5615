The Securities and Exchange Commission said it completed the settlement of insider trading charges with Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc., its chairman, Carl N. Karcher, and six members of his family. 

The defendants had agreed in July to pay $664,000 to settle the charges. 

Federal Judge Edward Rafeedie entered a final judgment of a permanent injunction, disgorgement and imposition of civil penalties against the defendants.
Each of the defendants consented to the entry of the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of insider trading. 

The complaint had alleged that Mr. Karcher conveyed inside information about a plunge in the fast-food chain's profit in 1984 to four of his children, Margaret J. LeVecke, Catherine Karcher-Everly, Jerome Karcher and Barbara Karcher Wall, and two of his sons-in-law, Daniel Everly and Donald E. Fergus Jr., who then sold their common shares in the company.
Carl N. Karcher isn't alleged to have sold any stock at that time. 

The final judgment requires Carl N. Karcher to pay a one-time penalty of $332,122.50, Mrs. LeVecke to disgorge $97,500, the Everlys to disgorge $34,375, Jerome Karcher to disgorge $72,500, Mrs. Wall to disgorge $63,873.75, and Mr. Fergus to disgorge $63,873.75. 

Alvin A. DeShano, the company's director of accounting, settled for $24,772 in August.
