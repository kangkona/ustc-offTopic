Hoylake Investments Ltd. said it controls 2.3% of the issued share capital of B.A.T Industries PLC. 

Hoylake is the consortium that has launched a hostile all-paper #13.4-billion ($20.97 billion) bid for the diversified British conglomerate.
It also announced that it would keep its offer open until Sept. 29. 

Last week, Hoylake was given some breathing space when the U.K. Panel on Takeovers and Mergers said Hoylake could let its bid for B.A.T lapse until it had cleared all regulatory hurdles with U.S. insurance commissioners.
Should the outcome of legal action in the U.S. prove successful, Hoylake can then launch its offer again within 21 days, the panel ruled.
