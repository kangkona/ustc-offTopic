Ford Motor Co. agreed to recall nearly half a million 1985 and 1986 cars to fix air-pollution control equipment, the Environmental Protection Agency said. 

The auto maker is recalling almost 200,000 1985 Ford Escort and Mercury Lynx vehicles and almost 300,000 1986 Ford Escort, Ford EXP and Mercury Lynx vehicles.
All have 1.9-liter engines; models with fuel injection and those sold in California aren't included. 

EPA tests found the cars are exceeding federal hydrocarbon and carbon-monoxide limits.
Ford will make free repairs to the choke system, the distributor spark advance and the air-injection system that helps the catalytic converter control exhausts, the agency said.
