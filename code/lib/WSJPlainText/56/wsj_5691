.START 

Concerning your Aug. 15 article about the many ex-aides of key congressional leaders who guided the 1986 tax-reform measure to its successful conclusion who have now become lobbyists against various provisions of the act: 

The only clear beneficiaries of the tax system now in effect are those with more than $150,000 in adjusted gross income who find their taxes reduced by 5%; those with more than $250,000 in AGI who find their taxes reduced by 10%; and at, say, $500,000, the very rich are paying at least 20% less under the new law.
The lobbyists against the bill clearly have ended up as beneficiaries.
Nearly all congressmen, with their ability to earn large amounts in lectures and appearances, are also clear beneficiaries.
Cabinet members and most of the people in the Washington establishment at the policy-making levels are beneficiaries.
Corporate executive officers, star athletes, anchormen, successful writers and many others have found their taxes reduced. 

But what about the rest of us?
Even the better-off of us are in about the same position as these congressional aides working on civil-service salaries were before they became lobbyists.
And it is far from clear that we have a fairer tax system.
It is instead a much more complicated system that is unfair to millions of taxpayers in the lower- to upper-middle-income brackets.
