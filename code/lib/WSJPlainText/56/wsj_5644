Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank N.V. of the Netherlands and Belgium's Generale de Banque S.A., as expected, called off their intended merger. 

The decision put to rest chances for the first cross-border merger of two European banking groups in anticipation of the European Community's removal of internal market barriers in 1992. 

The banks said they now plan to reduce their previous 10% cross-shareholdings in each other to 5% each, with the remaining shares resold to third parties at a substantial book profit of about 250 million guilders ($112.7 million).
Generale and Amro will share that profit equally. 

The companies first agreed to extensive business links in February 1988, when they announced plans to merge under one holding company within a few years.
The cross-shareholdings were taken at that time. 

Yesterday, however, the banks said that technical problems, especially regarding "legal and tax matters," and differing ideas on how the integration would work, led to the decision to cease merger plans. 

The companies said they will continue to broaden their business ties world-wide.
They added that a full or partial merger might be considered in the future.
