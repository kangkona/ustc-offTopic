Cooper Cos. and a group of dissident shareholders agreed to drop lawsuits they had filed against each other earlier this year. 

The shareholders, who control 7.18% of the company's stock, had sued the company and seven directors for allegedly "disseminating false and misleading proxy materials" to holders.
The suit, filed Aug. 1 in a federal court in Manhattan, claimed that the directors sought to ensure their re-election by not disclosing the latest financial information about the contact-lens company. 

The Palo Alto, Calif., company, in turn, sued the shareholders' group for alleged securities-law violations in its solicitation of proxies for a dissident slate of directors. 

Attorneys for the two sides said the agreement to drop the suits didn't involve any settlement by the parties.
But Melvin A. Brosterman, an attorney for Cooper, said the accord stemmed from a board decision to accept the nomination as a director of Moses Marx, a member of the shareholders' group.
However, Greg A. Danilow, an attorney for the shareholders' group, said the suits weren't dropped in return for the nomination of Mr. Marx, who controls 6% of Cooper's stock. 

The company's annual meeting, twice postponed, is scheduled for Sept. 27.
