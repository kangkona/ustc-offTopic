Arab foreign debt has grown in the past few years to an estimated $140 billion in 1988, compared with $68 billion in 1982, said the monthly bulletin of Gulf International Bank. 

The report called the level a matter for concern.
It cited an average rate of total external debt to gross domestic product of 65.8% in 1987, compared with 52.5% in 1982.
The corresponding average rate for the world's 17 most-indebted countries was 63.1% in 1987. 

For Egypt, Sudan, Jordan and Morocco, external debt exceeded GDP, the report said.
It noted that those four Arab countries, along with Iraq, also were facing debt-repayment difficulties and have had to reschedule part or all of their debt to reduce their overall debt-service burden.
Algeria, Syria, South Yemen and North Yemen have been able to forestall debt rescheduling. 

Lebanon, Somalia and Mauritania have virtually no access to international borrowing, while Oman, Qatar and Libya are able to tap international markets at reasonably good rates. 

The remaining Arab countries, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, have opted until now not to borrow internationally, preferring instead to draw on their domestic markets through government bonds and treasury bills.
