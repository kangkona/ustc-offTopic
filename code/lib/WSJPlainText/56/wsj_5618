Kimbark Oil & Gas Co. and Hallador Exploration Co. completed a merger in which Kimbark is issuing about 25.5 million common shares in exchange for Hallador's outstanding shares.
The swap gives former Hallador holders a 62% stake in the combined equity of the two companies. 

Officials of Denver-based Kimbark said they expect that the company's preferred stock will be converted into 6.8 million common shares after its annual meeting, set for Dec. 12.
They said they expect Kimbark's convertible note owed to investors in Harco, a Hallador affiliate, will be converted into 1.5 million common shares. 

Combined proved reserves of the oil and gas exploration company as of June 30 were estimated by a company spokesman at 800,000 barrels of oil and 15 million cubic feet of natural gas with a present pretax value exceeding $17 million.
