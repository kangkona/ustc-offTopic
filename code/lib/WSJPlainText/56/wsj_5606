Jack Richer, spokesman for a committee of independent directors established to solicit bids for Cineplex Odeon Corp., said the committee's investment advisers are reviewing a number of bids received for the company. 

Mr. Richer said he couldn't comment on the number of bids received, their value or any terms or conditions.
He didn't say whether Cineplex Odeon Chairman Garth Drabinsky submitted his own bid for the Toronto-based theater-exhibition chain. 

The committee was formed in the wake of a dispute between Mr. Drabinsky and the company's major holder, MCA Inc. 

Spokesmen for the committee's investment advisers, RBC Dominion Securities Inc. and Morgan Stanley Canada Ltd., weren't available for comment. 

Sources said the advisers may be ready to report on the bids and submit their recommendations to the committee by the end of this week.
Mr. Richer said he didn't know when details would be made public.
