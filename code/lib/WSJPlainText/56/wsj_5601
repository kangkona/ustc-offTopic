Cigarette production is declining this year, and for the 16th consecutive year, so is the average smoking rate among Americans, the Agriculture Department said. 

Total output is expected to drop from last year's 695 billion cigarettes because of higher prices, health concerns and smoking restrictions, the department's Economic Research Service said in a report. 

Cigarette use may drop about 3.5% from last year's average of 3,096 cigarettes, or fewer than 155 packs of 20 each, the report said. 

The average is for all Americans 18 years and older, smokers and nonsmokers alike.
It is a statistical comparison only and doesn't indicate the actual smoking habits of the population. 

Cigarette smoking peaked in 1963 at an average of 4,345 -- more than 217 packs -- before beginning its long decline. 

Total U.S. tobacco production this year is up about 9% from 1988, mostly because of an increased acreage. 

"Even with the larger crop and the continuing decline in U.S. cigarette consumption, flue-cured {the most abundant type of U.S. tobacco} auction prices are higher than a year ago," the report said. "The higher prices result from tightening supplies because of reduced carry-in {old inventories}, a relatively good quality crop, and higher price supports."
