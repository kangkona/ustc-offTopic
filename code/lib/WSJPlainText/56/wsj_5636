IPM Technology Inc. said it terminated a five-month-old agreement for a $5-a-share leveraged buy-out by its majority shareholder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Seymour Kahn. 

The announcement was made after the end of trading in IPM stock, which closed at $4.25, down 12.5 cents in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange. 

IPM, based in Los Angeles, provides fueling services to civilian and military aircraft and has airport cargo-handling operations.
Mr. Kahn owns a 58% stake. 

IPM said the agreement was terminated because a special committee of IPM's board determined that the $5-per-share price was no longer fair.
A company spokesman declined to elaborate. 

The agreement, reached in early April by IPM and SK Acquisition Inc., which is wholly owned by Mr. Kahn, called for SK to tender for the 42% of IPM's stock that Mr. Kahn didn't already own.
The offer had an indicated value of about $4.5 million.
Mr. Kahn told the committee that SK can't obtain financing for a higher offer.
