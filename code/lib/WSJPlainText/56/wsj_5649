The public sector borrowing requirement, the most widely used measure of Britain's government deficit or surplus, showed a deficit of #700 million ($1.1 billion) in August, after surpluses of #1.4 billion in July and #1.58 billion in August 1988, the U.K. Treasury said. 

In the five months since the current fiscal year began April 1, the measure shows a surplus of #700 million, compared with a surplus of #4.8 billion a year earlier.
