AIRCOA HOTEL PARTNERS L.P. said it will make a special distribution of $1.90 a Class A unit on Oct. 16 to stock of record Sept. 29.
The Denver hotel master limited partnership said the distribution is contingent on the completion of the sale of the Kona Village Resort for $55 million.
The sale is scheduled to close next Tuesday.
Aircoa said its partnership agreement requires it to distribute a portion of the proceeds from the sale of hotel or resort properties if the gain is $1 or more per Class A unit.
Because of the special distribution, Aircoa said the distribution for the third and fourth quarters of this year will be 57 cents a unit, compared with previous distributions of 60 cents a unit.
