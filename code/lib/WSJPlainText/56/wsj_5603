The Federal National Mortgage Association, in a move to expand its shareholder base, approved a 3-for-1 common stock split and increased its regular quarterly dividend. 

After adjusting for the split, which is subject to approval by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Fannie Mae's dividend will be 14 cents a share, up from 10.67 cents.
On a pre-split basis, the dividend was increased to 42 cents from 32 cents.
The new dividend is payable Nov. 25 to stock of record Oct. 31. 

The company said it would announce the record and distribution dates for its stock split as soon as HUD approval is obtained.
The company currently has 79,529,000 shares outstanding.
Fannie Mae closed yesterday at $113.875, down $1.625 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
In the past year, it has more than doubled from $45 a share. 

Fannie Mae, a congressionally chartered, shareholder-owned company, operates a secondary market in home loans, buying mortgages from lenders and packaging some into securities for sale to investors and holding others in portfolio. 

David Maxwell, Fannie Mae's chairman, said the split and the dividend increase "reflect our confidence in Fannie Mae's continued success and our interest in broadening the distribution of our stock."
