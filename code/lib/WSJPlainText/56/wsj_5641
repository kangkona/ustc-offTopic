Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp announced a Bush administration goal of cutting the nation's homeless population in half by 1992. 

In prepared remarks for a bi-regional conference of the federal Interagency Council on the Homeless, Mr. Kemp said his strategy calls for giving priority to families and the mentally ill who are homeless, closing welfare hotels and providing transitional and permanent homes to families along with supportive services, such as counseling and job training, if needed.
Mr. Kemp didn't, however, offer specific details on how to accomplish the goal. 

"It's hard to be specific, not because we don't know what we are going to do, but we're waiting to see how it all rolls out," said Anna Kondratas, assistant secretary for community planning and development for HUD. 

One proposal in the Kemp plan would allow nonprofit groups that are not tax-supported to buy foreclosed HUD homes for a 10% discount, as some tax-supported nonprofit groups have done.
He also promised to continue efforts to simplify the "complex mess" of bureaucratic barriers that has hindered federal homeless assistance.
