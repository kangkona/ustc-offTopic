Co op AG said it will emerge from receivership under West German bankruptcy laws after a last-minute rescue agreement with creditor banks. 

Under the accord, creditor banks of the troubled West German retailer agreed to a proposal by Deutsche Genossenschafts Bank, under which the banks will forgive 75% of Co op's debt of 2.7 billion marks ($1.37 billion) and DG Bank will take over all shares in the Frankfurt concern, said Co op's chief spokesman. 

"Debt forgiveness was declared, the full concept was accepted, so the state of overindebtedness no longer exists," the spokesman said. 

But not all Co op's creditors agreed to the rescue plan. "We have sufficient support, but it is not 100%," a spokesman for DG Bank said.
Bankers and company officials will try to win the support of banks that rejected the plan, he said. 

The bailout plan also calls for a reduction in the nominal value of the shares, followed by a sale of shares to raise funds.
