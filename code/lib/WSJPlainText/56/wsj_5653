Nederlandsche Middenstandsbank N.V. (NMB) and Postbank N.V. said they completed arrangements for their intended merger and will sign official agreements on Oct. 4. 

The Dutch banking companies said they then plan to split their post-merger shares 5-to-1 if shareholders approve the merge and split at a special meeting called for Oct. 5.
Approval is expected. 

The completion of the merger had previously been expected in September, but developed a last-minute hitch because of disagreements among different unions representing employees at the companies.
Those problems were resolved last week.
