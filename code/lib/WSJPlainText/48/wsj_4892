The Justice Department said it filed two separate criminal counts in federal court here accusing a Santa Rosa, Calif., bankruptcy trustee of embezzling more than $1.9 million from trustee accounts of several individuals and corporations. 

A Justice Department official called the charges against longtime trustee Charles Duck "the largest embezzlement ever charged against a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee." 

Mr. Duck, identified by Justice Department documents as a "wealthy businessman" who had handled thousands of bankruptcy cases, couldn't be reached for comment.
If convicted, he would face as much as five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each count. 

The Justice Department said the investigation of Mr. Duck was part of a nationwide federal inquiry into suspected fraud and embezzlement in the bankruptcy system.
There are about 1,700 court-appointed trustees; they are gradually being replaced by private trustees appointed by the Department of Justice, federal officials say.
