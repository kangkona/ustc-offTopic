Pechiney S.A. said net income more than doubled in the first half, partly reflecting the first-time consolidation of its U.S. packaging unit, American National Can. 

Jean Gandois, president of the state-controlled Paris-based metals group, told a news conference that consolidated net, after payments to minority interests, jumped to 1.729 billion francs (US$262 million) from 744 million francs a year earlier.
He said:"It was a good half and this is a good year," predicting that activity in terms of volume and profit was expected to remain "satisfactory" in the second half. 

Pechiney's earnings surge was based on an 83% revenue gain to 44.691 billion francs from 24.347 billion in the 1988 first half.
More than 14 billion francs of first-half revenue reflected the November purchase of American National Can in a $1.26 billion transaction that made Pechiney the world's biggest packaging concern. 

Helped in part by the dollar's advance against the French franc, operating profit spurted 93% to 4.823 billion francs from 2.494 billion a year earlier.
