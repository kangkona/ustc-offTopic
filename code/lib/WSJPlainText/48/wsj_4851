The U.S. shelved an unfair-trade complaint against Argentina after receiving assurances that the Latin American country will take certain steps to protect the patent rights of foreign pharmaceutical companies. 

Trade Representative Carla Hills announced that the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association has agreed to withdraw its complaint as a result of continuing progress in negotiations with Argentina and its promise of further concessions.
However, she warned that the U.S. won't "hesitate to reopen the matter if {further} progress is not forthcoming." 

The association, which represents the leading U.S. drug manufacturers, confirmed that it is withdrawing the complaint.
In its petition filed in August 1988, the trade body charged that, since 1980, its members had lost $526 million in sales opportunities in Argentina because the absence of legal protection for pharmaceutical patents allows the sale of unauthorized copies. 

Mrs. Hills didn't disclose how Argentina intends to satisfy the U.S. industry's demands.
She acknowledged, however, Argentina's willingness to "modify its pharmaceutical product-registration procedures." Mrs. Hills said she will pursue the issue further with Argentina's Foreign Minister Domingo Cavallo and Economics Minister Nestor Rapanelli.
Both officials are expected to accompany Argentine President Carlos Menem in his visit to Washington this week.
