Lodestar Group said in New York that it acquired more than 5% of the shares outstanding of three companies: American Bankers Insurance Group Inc., ADC Telecommunications Inc. and Marshall Industries. 

Lodestar said it owns 9.4% of American Bankers, a Miami-based insurance holding company.
Lodestar also said it owns 6.4% of ADC, a Bloomington, Minn., maker of electronic parts, and 8.8% of Marshall, an El Monte, Calif.-based distributor of electronic parts. 

Lodestar is an investment and merger advisory concern. 

Lodestar, which noted that it made the purchases because it believes the shares are undervalued, said it entered into an agreement with American Bankers that restricts its ownership for three years to not more than 9.9% of the company's stock. 

With regard to ADC and Marshall, Lodestar said it has agreed with the investors in its funds not to acquire more than 20% of the shares outstanding of the companies without the approval of their boards.
