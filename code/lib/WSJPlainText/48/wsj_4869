Schweizerische Aluminium AG, a Swiss chemical and aluminum group better known as Alusuisse, reported that consolidated group sales in the first half of 1989 jumped 23% to 3.55 billion Swiss francs ($2.1 billion) from 2.88 billion francs in the same period a year ago. 

Based on favorable economic conditions, positive foreign exchange rate factors and efficiencies stemming from internal restructurings, the company said it expects 1989 profit to exceed 450 million francs, up more than 40% from 315 million francs in 1988. 

The company didn't provide profit figures for the first half.
Its forecasts for the year exceeded analysts' expectations, which ranged between 400 million and 430 million francs. 

The company also said it is in negotiations to sell its U.S. unit, Consolidated Aluminium Corp. (Conalco) of St. Louis.
Officials declined to disclose the potential buyer or possible price, but noted that Conalco's results weren't included in the company's forecast as of Aug. 1.
