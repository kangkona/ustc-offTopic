TransCanada PipeLines Ltd., Toronto, said it will redeem all of its cumulative retractable first preferred shares, Series E, and replace them with another series of preferred shares of equal value at a later date. 

The 1.5 million shares will be redeemed Nov. 1 at 50 Canadian dollars (US$42.31) a share, or a total of C$75 million (US$63.5 million).
Holders of record Sept. 29 will receive the quarterly dividend of C$1.29 a share, payable Nov. 1. 

The shares to be redeemed carry an effective financing cost of 10.32%, a spokesman for the pipeline concern said.
The substitute issue of C$75 million of preferred shares, for which the timing and terms have yet to be set, is expected to carry a lower cost, he said.
