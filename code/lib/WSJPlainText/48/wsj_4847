Hadson Corp. said that Singer Co. will transfer 1.4 million Hadson shares back to Hadson to settle price adjustments related to Hadson's purchase of a Singer unit last year. 

Hadson, of Oklahoma City, said that under terms of its purchase of HRB Holdings Inc., the purchase price could be adjusted based on the examination of HRB's balance sheet.
The energy and defense concern said its review found that, among other things, it might have to make greater reimbursements to the government than the defense contractor had anticipated. 

Hadson purchased HRB for $137 million in cash and two million of its common shares, valued at about $4.37 a share, giving Singer about a 5.4% stake in Hadson.
As part of current transaction, Hadson also will purchase the remaining 600,000 of its shares from Singer for $2.1 million in cash, or about $3.50 a share. 

After the transaction, Hadson said it will have about 35.7 million shares outstanding.
