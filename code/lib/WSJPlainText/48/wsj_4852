A group holding 6% of Connecticut Bancorp Inc. lost a proxy fight to gain control of the board as the 13 incumbents slated by management were re-elected. 

The Norwalk, Conn., bank holding company originally nominated 16 directors, but two jumped to the opposition slate and the other withdrew in protest over the fight.
Management, which nominated 10 outside directors and three corporate officers, won with 53.7% of the vote, compared with 46.3% for the opposition group. 

The annual meeting will be reconvened this morning to ratify the vote. 

Last week, the U.S. District Court for Connecticut struck down an attempt by Peter V. Lathouris, chairman of the shareholders committee, to postpone the annual meeting.
