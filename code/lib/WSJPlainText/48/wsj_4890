Monarch Capital Corp. has decided not to sell its disability income insurance business and instead plans to expand it, with the goal of doubling its size in the next three years. 

Last July, the company hired Merrill Lynch Capital Markets to help it study various strategies for the unit, including boosting its growth, reinsuring existing blocks of the business or selling it entirely.
Monarch's stock surged after the announcement on speculation that if the unit were sold the cash might be used to buy back shares or even take the firm private. 

Last year, the disability income unit contributed $19.5 million of Monarch's total $33.8 million in pretax profit. 

Gordon N. Oakes Jr., Monarch's chairman and chief executive, said the insurer had terminated talks with several companies that had expressed an interest in buying the unit. 

Mr. Oakes said the interest that other insurers showed in Monarch's disability income products that was "the determining factor" in the company's decision to keep the unit.
Many life insurers want to offer disability income insurance, but would prefer to let Monarch handle the underwriting, administration and claims processing. 

Monarch's highly automated back office already handles disability income insurance products for eight other insurers, which sell the policies under their own name.
Some 14 other companies sell the Monarch disability income policies under Monarch's name through their sales agents. 

Monarch shares fell 50 cents to close at $37.50 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
