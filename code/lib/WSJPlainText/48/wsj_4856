WCI Holdings Corp., Santa Monica, Calif., said its Wickes Cos. unit agreed definitively to sell its heat transfer group to Lennox International Inc. for about $110 million. 

The transaction would bring the proceeds from sales of Wickes assets to about $1.06 billion.
Wickes, a retailer and industrial concern, was acquired in a two-step $538.9 million leveraged buy-out last year by WCI Holdings, which is owned jointly by Blackstone Capital Partners Limited Partnership and Wasserstein Perella Partners Limited Partnership. 

The heat transfer group includes Wickes's Bohn Heat Transfer Division and Larkin Inc., makers of heat exchangers for commercial refrigeration and air conditioning.
The companies have a total of 1,776 employees and four facilities in Illinois and Georgia.
