August orders at U.S. machine tool plants fell 33.3% from a year earlier, to $226.6 million from $301.4 million, according to the Association of Manufacturing Trade Technology, a trade group. 

Domestic tool orders increased 18.8% from $190.8 million in July as orders from the automobile industry increased significantly, the trade group said. 

Machine tools are power-driven devices that cut or shape metal parts used in everything from appliances to vehicles.
Economists consider their sales and orders important indicators of capital-spending patterns by makers of large products like automobiles and aircraft.
