McClatchy Newspapers Inc. said it signed an agreement to acquire three daily newspapers and five other publications from News & Observer Publishing Co. of Raleigh, N.C., for $74.1 million. 

The publications are in South Carolina's York and Beaufort counties.
Their purchase would mark the Sacramento, Calif., media chain's first acquisition of newspapers outside the Western states. 

McClatchy said the proposed acquisitions are part of a longtime company strategy to acquire and publish small and medium-sized "quality newspapers in quality markets." Closing of the transaction is scheduled for Jan. 1. 

The South Carolina daily newspapers are The Herald of Rock Hill {circulation 28,000}, The Island Packet of Hilton Head {circulation 10,000} and The Beaufort Gazette {circulation 9,000}. 

McClatchy publishes six daily newspapers and seven smaller newspapers in California, Washington state and Alaska.
