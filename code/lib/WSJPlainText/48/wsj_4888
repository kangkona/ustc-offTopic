Toshiba Corp. said it agreed to buy a supercomputer for its own use from Cray Research Inc. of the U.S. for about 3.5 billion yen ($24 million). 

The supercomputer, Toshiba's second to be purchased from Cray, will be installed in December, officials of the Tokyo-based company said. 

They said Toshiba will use the new system mainly for design and simulation of next-generation semiconductors, like the 16-megabit and 64-megabit dynamic random access memory chips. 

Toshiba said it decided to buy the Cray supercomputer, a top-of-the-line product with a large memory, because of an abundant supply of software, as well as Toshiba's accumulated expertise in using Cray supercomputers.
