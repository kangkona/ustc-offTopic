Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd., Hong Kong, said after-tax profit jumped 41% in the year's first six months to 634 million Hong Kong dollars (US$81.2 million) from HK$450 million a year earlier. 

Henry Keswick, recently appointed chairman of the retailing, engineering, construction and financial services giant said the strong performance, which exceeded most market expectations, isn't likely to be repeated in the second half.
He cited a slowdown in Hong Kong tourism and consumer spending in the wake of the political crackdown in June in China.
But the company's diversity should ensure "satisfactory" profit growth, he said. 

Per-share earnings climbed to HK$1.14 from 79 Hong Kong cents.
Net income, including a gain of HK$260 million largely from the sale of its 7-Eleven convenience-store business outside Hong Kong, nearly doubled to HK$894 million from HK$450 million.
Revenue rose 14% in the first half to HK$6.94 billion from HK$6.08 billion.
