International efforts to drive down the value of the U.S. dollar depressed the credit markets yesterday, sending bond prices sharply lower in nervous trading. 

The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell more than one point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 face amount.
The benchmark's yield jumped to 8.29%, the highest closing yield for a benchmark issue since June 23 when it was 8.32%. 

Traders said the market got off to a weak start during overnight trading in Europe and Japan. "The dollar got bashed in Tokyo," said Joseph Liro, a vice president and money market economist at S.G. Warburg Securities & Co. 

William Sullivan, director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the market lost 1/2 point in overnight trading.
When trading began in the U.S., he said, the market fell further on news of unexpectedly strong auto sales. "There was consistent selling pressure throughout the day due to several factors, but the dollar was the dominant negative factor," said Mr. Sullivan. 

On Saturday, finance officials from the so-called Group of Seven industrial nations met in Washington and agreed that the dollar was too strong.
The central bank officials followed up the missive by dumping dollars on foreign exchange markets.
In late trading in New York, the dollar tumbled to 1.8993 West German marks and 142.13 yen, down sharply from 1.9510 marks and 146 yen late Friday. 

A falling dollar reduces the value of dollar-denominated securities relative to foreign securities.
A weaker dollar worries domestic bondholders who fear that foreign investors would move to the sidelines and refuse to buy new U.S. securities, or worse, would cash in their dollar securities to buy foreign securities. 

The large supply comes this week in the form of $32.3 billion of new government notes and bills.
Yesterday, the government auctioned $14.8 billion of short-term bills in its regular weekly auction.
The three-month bills had an average discount rate of 7.72% while the six-month bills had an average discount rate of 7.79%.
Those rates were up from last week's auction, when the average discount rate on both issues was 7.64%. 

Today, the Treasury will auction $9.75 billion of two-year notes followed by an auction tomorrow of $7.75 billion of four-year notes. 

Bond market analysts were uncertain about the type of reception the note auctions will receive.
Although the sell-off in the market has propped yields up to levels that should be attractive to domestic investors, concerns that the dollar may continue its slide was expected to dampen foreign buying interest. 

"Had it not been for this sudden collapse in the dollar, we might have seen some emerging interest in the two-year and four-year note auctions on the part of the Japanese," said David Resler, chief economist at Normura Securities International Inc. "But how we got here may make investors nervous." 

But Mr. Liro contended that the Japanese may be drawn to the relatively high yields. "The Japanese are yield buyers, and these yield levels have to start looking attractive," he said.
In when-issued trading, the two-year notes yielded 8.36% while the four-year notes yielded about 8.32%. 

Some economists contend that individual investors, who typically buy securities at Treasury auctions through noncompetitive bids, will show strong interest for the two-year notes, repeating the pattern seen at yesterday's six-month bill sale. 

At the auction, noncompetitive tenders for the bills totaled $1.23 billion, up from $754.7 million at last week's sale. 

Treasury Securities 

Treasury bonds were sharply lower in moderate trading. 

The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 98 4/32 compared with 99 5/32 Friday.
The latest two-year notes were quoted late at 99 21/32 to yield 8.405% compared with 99 27/32 to yield 8.298% Friday.
Ten-year notes were quoted at 97 25/32 to yield 8.313% compared with 98 16/32 to yield 8.204%. 

Here are details of yesterday's auction: 

Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value.
Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.
The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year. 

Both issues are dated Sept. 28.
The 13-week bills mature Dec. 28, and the 26-week bills mature March 29, 1990. 

Corporate Issues 

The junk bonds of Lomas Financial Corp. tumbled on news that the Dallas-based holding company will seek protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. 

The company's issue of 10 3/4% subordinated notes maturing in 1993 fell 17 points to 28 yesterday.
The issue had lost four points Friday to finish at 45. 

Dealers said they saw a lot of interest in Lomas paper yesterday, but they added that trading was limited, as it has been for months. 

Lomas Financial's bankruptcy-law filing Sunday covered $1.3 billion of bank debt and senior notes, $185 million of senior real estate debt and $700 million of publicly traded subordinated notes. 

The market value of the public notes has tumbled since the company's default earlier this month on $145 million in bank notes.
The notes are now worth less than half their face value. 

Meanwhile, junk bonds of Seaman Furniture Co. rose yesterday on news that the company has reached an agreement in principle with all its senior lenders on restructuring its outstanding debt. 

Traders said the Uniondale, N.Y.-based furniture company's 15% junior subordinated debentures maturing in 1999 were bid late in the day at 9.
The debentures were quoted at 6 on Friday. 

As part of its restructuring plan, Seaman plans to exchange $20.8 million principal amount of new 12% subordinated pay-in-kind notes and 8% of the common equity of the restructured company, subject to dilution, for about $83 million principal amount of 90% of the outstanding junior subordinated debentures. 

Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., its investors and members of the Seaman family will commit $42 million of new funds in the restructured company. 

In the broader junk bond market, so-called high quality issues closed about 1/8 to 1/4 point lower in what dealers described as very slow trading.
Investment-grade corporate bonds fell about 3/4 of a point. 

Among new issues, Formica Corp. offered a $100 million junk issue of senior subordinated notes due Oct. 1, 1999.
The notes were priced at par to yield 14%. 

Foreign Bonds 

Japanese government bonds ended sharply higher as the value of the yen strengthened against the dollar. 

Japan's benchmark No. 111 4.6% issue due 1998 ended at a price of 96.53, up 0.69 point from Friday.
The yield fell .12 percentage point to 5.175%. 

Meanwhile, Japan's offering later this week of new 10-year bonds was pushed to the background.
While the market's spurt is expected to enhance demand for the bonds, traders said foreign exchange remains the catalyst for bond market activity. 

About 500 billion yen {$3.42 billion} to 700 billion yen of bonds are expected to be offered with a coupon rate of about 5%, according to traders.
At the previous offering earlier this month, the 600 billion yen September bonds received a 4.9% coupon priced at 100.04 to yield 4.894%. 

Elsewhere: 

-- West German government bonds ended narrowly mixed.
The deutsche mark bond market often firms when the dollar falls, but dealers said Monday that the lack of buying reflected concern that West Germany's central bank will raise interest rates sometime next month. 

"It's not a question of whether they'll do it," said one trader. "It's a question of when will they do it, and how much." 

West German import prices, meanwhile, rose 0.4% in August and were up 2.7% compared with the level for August 1988, the West German federal statistics office said.
That was in line with expectations and was down from an annual rate of 3.1% in July and 5.3% in June. 

Bonn's 6 3/4% issue due June 1999 fell 0.10 point to 98.85 to yield 6.91% while the 6 3/4% notes due 1994 dropped 0.10 point to 98.625 to yield 7.10%.

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report expect the August current-account gap to have narrowed to #1.5 billion {$2.36 billion}. 

The benchmark treasury 1 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007 rose 3/32 to close at 113 3/8 to yield 9.90% while the 12% bonds due 1995 rose 1/32 to 104 3/4 to yield 10.78%. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities 

Government National Mortgage Association securities and other mortgage-backed securities were off 1/4 to 3/4 in late trading, having remained under pressure from weaker Treasurys and a soft dollar throughout the session. 

Ginnie Mae 9% securities for October delivery were at 96 14/32, off 10/32 from late Friday.
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 10% securities were at 99 24/32 in late dealings, off 17/32 for the session. 

Spreads between yields on active mortgage issues and Treasurys were slightly narrower on the day. 

The closely watched Ginnie Mae 9% securities were yielding about 9.65% to a 12-year average life assumption, for a 1.325 percentage point spread to the benchmark 10-year Treasury note.
Late Friday, that spread was 1.34 percentage points. 

Municipals 

Municipal dollar bonds were off 1/4 to 7/8 point in late trading, reacting to lower Treasury coupon prices, a soft dollar and trepidation over a heavy forward calendar. 

Today, underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Co. may launch an issue of approximately $750 million of New York City general obligation bonds. 

Moody's Investors Service Inc. rated the issue single-A yesterday, saying that New York "has consistently displayed an ability and willingness to maintain sound financial controls and operations, thereby providing upper-medium grade security." 

As of late Friday, Standard & Poor's Corp. had the issue under review. 

According to unofficial price talk circulating among traders late yesterday, the New York City issue is to include insured bonds due 2006-2009, priced to yield in the 7.45% to 7.5% range, and uninsured bonds due 2010-2019, yielding 7.70% to 7.75%. 

The offering is expected to include all serial bonds, maturing 1991-2019. 

In the secondary market, meanwhile, New Jersey Turnpike Authority 7.20% issue of 2018 was quoted at 95 7/8 to 96, off 5/8 from late Friday.
The bonds yielded about 7.54%, .05 percentage point more than they did Friday afternoon. 

Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority 7 1/8% issue of 2019 was off 1/4 at 94 3/4 to 94 7/8.
