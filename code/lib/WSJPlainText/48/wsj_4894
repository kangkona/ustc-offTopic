Yellow Freight System Inc., Overland Park, Kan., said its earnings for the third quarter will fall significantly below its year-earlier results of $26.7 million, or 93 cents a share. 

Although the trucking concern declined to make a specific earnings forecast, Yellow Freight said the results also will be "substantially below" the $18.4 million, or 64 cents a share, it earned in the second quarter of this year. 

The company said its revenue, operating margins and net income have been hurt by an acceleration of price discounting in the second and third quarters. 

Yellow Freight said it plans to improve revenue yields by exercising greater pricing restraint and by raising its rates 5.5% by Jan. 1. 

In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Yellow Freight shares fell 37.5 cents to close at $29.25.
