L.J. Hooker Corp. has decided against opening its B. Altman & Co. store in the Walden Galleria mall in Buffalo, 

In August, L.J. Hooker filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
Its parent company, Hooker Corp. of Australia, also is being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator. 

Separately, General Electric Capital Corp., a unit of General Electric Co., agreed to purchase as much as $75 million in receivables from L.J. Hooker's B. Altman and Bonwit Teller chains.
Currently, Bonwit Teller and B. Altman are servicing their credit-card customers and will continue to so. 

The $75 million agreement is distinct from an earlier agreement under which GE Capital is providing as much as $50 million in debtor-in-possession financing for L.J. Hooker's various divisions.
