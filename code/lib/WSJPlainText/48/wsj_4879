Itel Corp., Chicago, said it bought a 45% stake in a Mexico City-based rail car leasing company, Quadrum S.A., for about $50 million. 

The rail car and intermodal container rental firm said the move is its first venture in Mexico.
As part of the pact, Itel is arranging credit for Quadrum with financial institutions. 

Itel said its stake includes a 35% interest it bought in the publicly traded company as well as a new issue of Quadrum shares. 

Itel said it has the option to increase its stake to more than 50% of Quadrum, which has interests in financial services and telecommunications equipment.
