Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, Mass., said it has developed a new chip-packaging technology that can double computer performance when compared with conventional circuit board packaging technology. 

The technology -- which allows up to 30 times greater circuit density than conventional boards -- was developed at more than $100 million.
The densely packed circuits operate more efficiently, yet don't need additional cooling, Digital said. 

"This will change the way we design computers, letting us do things we couldn't do before, with better performance at lower cost," said Robert M. Glorioso, vice president, high performance systems.
Digital's VAX 9000 mainframe computers, expected next month, will be the first models to use the new technology, he said. 

Digital has lagged in the design of mainframe-class computers behind International Business Machines Corp., which has dominated the lucrative market.
But Digital is making progress, analysts say.
