Chevron Corp. said it sold a mining property in northern Maine to a unit of Trelleborg AB, a Swedish rubber, mining and mineral company, for $5 million and additional royalties. 

Following the sale by Chevron Resources Co. to Boliden International Mining Co., the new owner is expected to develop the property in Aroostook County at a cost of about $60 million. 

The Bald Mountain ore reserve is expected to supply a 15-year mining operation with copper and zinc-sulphide as well as modest amounts of gold and silver during the early years of mining.
