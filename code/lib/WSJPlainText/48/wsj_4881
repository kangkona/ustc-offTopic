Quebec voters re-elected Premier Robert Bourassa and his Liberal Party government handily but he will face a stronger and much louder opposition contingent in the 125-seat National Assembly when it reconvenes later this fall. 

Mr. Bourassa, 56 years old, said he felt "very well, very happy" as he left his home last night to go to his campaign headquarters. 

According to preliminary returns, the Liberal Party was leading or elected in 92 districts, or ridings, the separatist Parti Quebecois was leading or elected in 29 ridings, and the Equality Party, a new party that ran candidates in English-speaking districts, was leading or elected in four ridings. 

Mr. Bourassa's victory was expected.
The apparent victories of the protest Equality Party weren't.
While opinion polls late in the campaign gave the Equality Party a majority of English-speaking voters -- traditionally strong Liberal supporters -- in a handful of ridings, most analysts hadn't expected the Equality Party to win any seats. 

The Parti Quebecois, helped by leader Jacques Parizeau's surprisingly strong campaign performance, boosted its share of the popular vote to 40% from 38.6% in the December 1985 election.
The Parti Quebecois' 29 seats compare with the 23 seats it won in 1985, when the National Assembly had 122 seats.
