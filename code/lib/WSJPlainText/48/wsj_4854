Arthur Abba Goldberg, executive vice president of Matthews & Wright Group Inc., was sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined $100,000 for his role in a scheme to defraud a trust fund as part of a $300 million Guam bond issue underwritten by Matthews & Wright. 

Mr. Goldberg, who in July pleaded guilty in federal court here to three counts of using the mails to defraud the Guam trust fund of $57,500, also was sentenced to five years probation and ordered to make restitution of $300,000 to the South Pacific U.S. territory.
However, Mr. Goldberg would be eligible for parole after six months in prison, and the amount of restitution could be reduced under the sentence handed down yesterday by Senior U.S. District Judge Jesse Curtis. 

Known as an aggressive Wall Street dealmaker, Mr. Goldberg was indicted by a U.S. grand jury in Guam in late 1987 on 52 counts of bribery, fraud and obstruction of justice in what authorities had charged was a nationwide bogus bond scheme totaling $2 billion. 

The 46-year-old Mr. Goldberg, a former New Jersey deputy attorney general, has been on leave from Matthews & Wright since the indictment.
Still pending are the Securities and Exchange Commission's charges against him and others of fraud in connection with "sham closings" of more than $1 billion of municipal bonds in violation of tax rules in 1985 and 1986.
Matthews & Wright and two individuals settled with the SEC; Mr. Goldberg was fighting the charges. 

K. William O'Connor, the U.S. attorney for Guam, had sought a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and a $750,000 fine.
But he said yesterday that the court had gone "into the matter with great care and the public interest has been served" by the sentence.
An attorney for Mr. Goldberg declined to comment.
