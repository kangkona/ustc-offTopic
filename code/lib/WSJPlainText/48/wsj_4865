Brunswick Corp., Skokie, Ill., sold its 49% stake in a camouflage net maker to the Sioux tribe of Fort Totten, N.D., for roughly $3 million. 

The Sioux tribe already owned 51% of the company, which began as a joint venture with Brunswick 15 years ago under a U.S. Small Business Administration program designed to develop minority businesses. 

Devils Lake Sioux Manufacturing Corp., which will be renamed Sioux Manufacturing Corp., generates annual revenue of about $40 million and employs about 300 people, said Robert E. Manning, Devils Lake vice president and general manager of the net maker. 

Brunswick, a maker of marine, recreation and defense products, wouldn't confirm terms of the sale. 

Tribal Assets Management, Portland, Maine, and State Street Bank of Boston arranged financing of the purchase, Mr. Manning said.
