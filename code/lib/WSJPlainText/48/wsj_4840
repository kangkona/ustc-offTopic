Mountain West Savings Bank said its board would meet tomorrow to review an unsolicited offer of about $25 million, or $15.25 a share, from an undisclosed institution seeking to acquire all of its shares.
The company said its review would be assisted by its investment bankers Nagelvoort & Co., New York.
It declined to elaborate. 

The Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, thrift, with assets of $325.7 million, operates ten branches and three loan production offices in Idaho.
Formerly known as First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Coeur d'Alene, it posted a net loss of $433,400 for the nine-month period ended June 30.
It attributed the loss largely to reserves taken to cover possible losses on loans to an Arizona building contractor. 

In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Mountain West shares jumped $1.50 to close at $13.75.
