A majority of the nation's business economists now believe the economy will avoid a recession until 1991 or even later, according to a survey by the National Association of Business Economists. 

The quarterly survey, taken in August, found that 62.7% of the economists think a downturn won't arrive until after next year.
When they were asked the same question in a May survey, only 36.9% believed the U.S. would escape a recession through 

But the economists predict that economic growth will be slightly slower through next year than they projected in the May survey.
Their median forecast is for the economy to grow 2.1% from the fourth quarter of 1988 to the fourth quarter of 1989 after removing the effects of inflation, compared with the 2.3% they estimated in May.
They expect growth from the fourth quarter of 1989 to the fourth quarter of 1990 to be 2.2% instead of the 2.3% they predicted in May. 

The economists may have become more bullish since the August survey.
When they made their forecasts, the government was estimating the economy's second-quarter growth at an annual rate of 1.7%.
That estimate has since been revised to 2.5%.
