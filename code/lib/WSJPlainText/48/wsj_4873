Keith F. Pinsoneault, citing "personal and business reasons," resigned as president and chief operating officer of the closely held investment banking concern.
The company said that the parting was "extremely amicable," and that "we foresee an orderly transition period." Sutro said it wouldn't name a successor for Mr. Pinsoneault, who joined the concern in 1985, but instead would divide his duties among other members of Sutro's management committee.
