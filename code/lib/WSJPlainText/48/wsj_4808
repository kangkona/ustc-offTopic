Fletcher Challenge Ltd., a New Zealand-based forest products, construction and energy concern, is studying possible acquisitions in Europe and North America, the company's chief executive officer said after a presentation to analysts here. 

Hugh Fletcher said the company has been gathering information about possible European acquisition targets for about a year.
However, the company isn't in a rush and "the odds aren't very high {Fletcher Challenge will make an acquisition there} in the very near future," he said. 

But Mr. Fletcher said that in the longer term, the company will aggressively seek to expand in eastern North America and in Europe because "it's the logical direction to go." Operations are currently concentrated on the Pacific Rim in New Zealand, Australia, Western Canada and California.
The company also has forest products operations in South America. 

In North America Mr. Fletcher said the company has been studying electricity and gas utilities but didn't indicate if Fletcher intends to move quickly.
He said the company is also interested in the gas exploration business. 

Mr. Fletcher said the company's rate of growth in terms of assets over the next three years probably won't match the rate over the last three years.
Assets at June 30, 1986, were 3.9 billion New Zealand dollars ($2.3 billion U.S.), compared with NZ$14.1 billion ($8.3 billion) June 30, 1989.
