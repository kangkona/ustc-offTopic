Eli Lilly & Co. said it will build a $115 million plant near Strasbourg, France, to boost production of a genetically engineered form of human insulin. 

Construction of the plant, which will be the pharmaceutical concern's third facility to make the product, Humulin, will begin next autumn, with production starting in early 1993. 

Lilly, based in Indianapolis, is the world's largest producer of insulin, which is used by diabetics.
About half of U.S. diabetics currently use Humulin, which is made by recombinant-DNA procedures and thus differs from the natural protein extracted from animal sources.
A Lilly spokesman said that use of Humulin, introduced in 1982, is growing. 

The French plant, which will employ about 300 people, will be built in the town of Fegersheim, adjacent to an existing Lilly manufacturing operation that has about 500 workers.
