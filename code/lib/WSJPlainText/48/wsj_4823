Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Samuel Pierce was denied a requested delay in his scheduled testimony today before the House subcommittee investigating the unfolding federal housing scandal. 

Yesterday, in a letter to the chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee on employment and housing, Paul Perito and two other lawyers for Mr. Pierce sought the delay, saying they haven't had adequate time to prepare Mr. Pierce to testify because they were retained Sept. 6. 

After the request was denied, Mr. Perito said his client will obey a subpoena and appear before the panel today.
But the lawyer wouldn't say if the former secretary would answer questions or invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.
Mr. Pierce didn't appear voluntarily as scheduled for a Sept. 15 hearing. 

Last week, the subcommittee subpoenaed Mr. Pierce to appear today and on Oct. 27 and Nov. 3.
His lawyers had asked that today's hearing be canceled and that Mr. Pierce appear Oct. 27 as planned.
Mr. Pierce testified in May. 

Rep. Tom Lantos (D., Calif.), chairman of the subcommittee, said the panel's work wouldn't be delayed because Mr. Pierce "procrastinated" in obtaining counsel.
