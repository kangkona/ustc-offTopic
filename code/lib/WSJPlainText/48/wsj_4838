Tokyo stocks closed higher Monday, with the key Nikkei index nearly reaching an intraday high of 35000.
Shares fell in London and posted gains in Frankfurt. 

In Tokyo, sentiment was initially buoyed by Bank of Japan intervention at the start of Monday Tokyo currency dealings.
The central bank apparently also sold a small amount of dollars shortly before the finish of afternoon currency dealings. 

Index-linked investment trust fund buying, which entered the market several times during the day, helped push up a wide range of issues, traders said. 

The market mood improved on the relative strength of the yen, lower short-term domestic interest rates and higher bond prices, traders said.
Monday's advance marked the third consecutive daily gains for the Nikkei.
It was the first three-day string of advances since Aug. 15-17. 

Turnover remained small, however.
Volume failed to pick up in the afternoon session as the sharp fall in the U.S. currency began to confuse investors, traders said. 

The Nikkei index ended the day at 34960.71, up 188.92 points from Friday's close.
The index gained 26.77 points Friday.
Volume on the First Section was estimated at 550 million shares, down from 700 million Friday. 

The Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed in the first section, which lost 4.12 points Friday, was up 13.80 to 

In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index rose 118.92 points to 35079.63. 

Participation by investors Monday remained sluggish partly because it was the last trading day for September transactions.
Dealers said those who had already met trading requirements for the month didn't participate in Monday's trading and were preparing for October. 

While stressing they haven't lowered their guard against currency fluctuations and higher interest rates, traders and fund managers expressed hope for more market advances.
They added sentiment was encouraged by the central bank's active efforts Monday to stabilize the foreign exchange market. 

Amid thin dealings, high-priced issues continued to receive buying interest following Friday's gains.
Pioneer added 250 yen to 5,200 yen ($35.60).
Kyocera advanced 320 to 5,900, and Fanuc was up 100 yen at 7,500 yen. 

Electrical utilities were bought as the weaker dollar was expected to cut dollar-denominated oil prices, traders said.
Tokyo Electric Power gained 50 yen to 5,700 yen.
Kansai Electric Power was up 50 yen at 4,520 yen. 

Securities firms, sluggish on expectations of a profit decline caused by a slump in transactions in the last few months, rebounded Monday.
Yamaichi Securities advanced 110 to 1,830.
Daiwa Securities was up 110 at 2,210.
Nomura Securities gained 90 to 3,160. 

London shares continued to drift Monday along with Wall Street, closing broadly lower in the year's lightest trading. 

The Financial Times 100-share index, the most closely watched market index, finished 10.6 points lower at 2359.6.
The 30-share index ended at 1937.3, down 12.2.
Volume was only 280.5 million shares, down from 452.9 million Friday. 

Besides a softer opening on Wall Street, dealers said London declined on a lack of interest in fresh positions ahead of Tuesday's U.K. balance of payments figures for August. 

Dealers said that while there hasn't been a clear outlook for the prospective results of the key indicator, investors were unwilling to bet either way and chose instead to take to the sidelines before the results are known. 

The Group of Seven nations' decision over the weekend to stress coordinated intervention to cap the dollar's advance also helped to pressure the market's so-called offshore earners, companies with large dollar-denominated sales volume. 

Among such issues, Imperial Chemical Industries shed 13 pence to #12.78 ($20), Glaxo Holdings lost 20 to #15.19, BOC Group declined 3 to 522 pence, and Reuters Holdings shed 8 to 940.
Volume in the decliners, however, was extremely thin, which dealers said indicated the lack of aggressiveness in the talk of dollar-related selling on the London exchange. 

Jaguar shares found some support on news that the U.K. luxury auto maker may seek a friendly partner to ward off hostile advances from Ford Motor Co. of the U.S.
The stock, however, finished at 576, down 5.
It was among the more actively traded shares on the day at 4.6 million. 

Frankfurt prices closed higher in moderate trading, as strong buying demand at the opening ran into profit-taking at midsession.
The DAX index climbed 7.13 points to end at 1635.93, but was off its intraday high shortly after the opening at 1638.81. 

Traders said the market continued rising following the West German central bank's decision Thursday not to raise lending rates.
Also, continued lively interest from foreign investors hoping to capitalize on the strengthening mark added to the market's climb. 

"It looks like there's lively foreign demand at the moment taking advantage of exchange rate changes," said Andreas Kaltschmitt, a trader for Commerzbank in Frankfurt. "It remains to be seen, however, if that won't be turned around if the dollar starts to climb again." 

As a result of the apparent reprieve in interest rate speculation, banking shares gained sharply Monday.
Commerzbank shot up 4.5 marks to 263 marks ($135), and Dresdner Bank gained 3.8 to 363.8.
Deutsche Bank climbed 2.5 marks to 700.5 marks early in the session but fell back on profit-taking to the level of Friday's close at 698. 

Auto shares were also firmer, as Bayerische Motoren Werke climbed 7.5 to 636.5, Daimler-Benz gained 1.2 to 796, and Volkswagen added 1.5 to 476. 

Elsewhere, share prices closed mixed in Paris and lower in Zurich, Milan, Stockholm and Brussels.
