In your Aug. 25 article on the Department of Energy's nuclear-weapons-sites cleanup, you question the high costs involved. 

Lack of congressional oversight was certainly a factor in the decades of waste accumulation at these sites.
Now, Congress is treating the situation with more than the normal amount of demagoguery.
The demagoguery is fueled by hysterical press coverage, such as your article's reference to the "nuclear nightmare." And now these 35-year-old sites are being subjected to overregulation to the point that the cost-to-benefit ratio of some cleanup and refitting activities is ludicrously high. 

One area where we are wasting the most money is in engineering against negligible releases of radioactivity into the environment.
The public's natural background radiation exposure varies widely and is regarded by a growing number of scientists to be beneficial or even essential for human health.
Epidemiological studies, recently aided by the availability of home radon data and decades of animal studies, suggest that an increase over average background levels would not be harmful and may indeed be beneficial in terms of stimulating biological immunity and maintaining biological systems in a conditioned state.
Despite this fact, a release that would increase a DOE-site neighbor's radiation exposure by less than 1% is regarded as a disaster to be avoided at all costs.
