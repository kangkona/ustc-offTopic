Stocks tripped over a falling dollar and tumbling bonds, but volume was light. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 22.42 to 2659.19.
Among the broader market measures, Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.82 to 344.23.
Some 121,130,000 shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the lightest volume since July 3 when volume dropped to 68.9 million shares, a 1989 low. 

Chung Lew, head trader at Kleinwort Benson North America Inc., said there is broad uncertainty in the market over the implications of a declining dollar.
Consequently, stock traders looked to long-term Treasury bonds. 

The Treasury bond market provided an illustration of what the dollar's slide means for international investors' appetite for U.S. securities.
As bonds fell in anticipation of less foreign buying, traders sold stocks. 

"Investment flows are the most important factor in the stock market," said Mr. Lew. "And a rising and falling currency has tremendous implications for investment flows." 

A number of blue chip shares that were popular recently were hit with hard selling.
Philip Morris fell 2 1/8 to 155 1/2.
Procter & Gamble fell 1 1/8 to 118 3/4. "I think there is profit-taking" in blue chips, said Jack Solomon, technical analyst at Bear Stearns. "Bearishness is front-running bearishness" as October nears, he said. 

Procter & Gamble and Philip Morris are two stocks often used in computer guided stock-index arbitrage strategies, in which traders attempt to capitalize on price differences between a basket of stocks and the related stock-index futures contract.
Program selling kicked in at several points yesterday as traders bought "cheaper" S&P futures -- which fell in reaction to tumbling bond prices -- and sold the underlying stocks. 

So-called country funds, which invest entirely in one country's stocks, also slumped.
Thai Fund tumbled 3 1/4, to 23, a 12% decline.
Germany Fund fell 1 to 12, and Malaysia Fund slipped 1 to 13.
Spain Fund, however, rebounded late in the day and closed 3/4 higher at 26 3/4. 

Analysts say many of these closed-end funds, which surged recently on heavy Japanese buying, are overvalued because they are trading at historically large premiums to their underlying stocks.
A closed-end fund has a fixed number of shares outstanding, like other companies whose shares trade on stock exchanges or over the counter. 

Columbia Pictures, the most active Big Board issue by a wide margin, jumped 5 1/4 to 26 3/8 as 6.2 million shares changed hands in composite trading.
Entertainment industry sources said Sony, long rumored to be pursuing the company, agreed to acquire it for $26 to $28 a share.
Sony gained 1 3/8 to 59 1/2. 

MCA, another movie company often cited in takeover speculation, rose 1 7/8 to 63 5/8 in heavier-than-usual trading.
Elsewhere in the group, Paramount Communications added 1 1/8 to 54 3/4 and Orion Pictures rose 1 to 22 1/8.
Coca-Cola, one of the few stocks in the industrial average to close higher, went up 5/8 to 63.
Among other blue chips, International Business Machines eased 1/4 to 116 1/4. 

Also, American Telephone & Telegraph fell 1 to 42 1/8 on speculation that the company plans to disclose a business transaction with British Telecommunications, rather than a reorganization or restructuring, at a news conference planned for today.
British Telecom climbed 1 5/8 to 46 1/8; there were rumors that the arrangement would call for AT&T to acquire a stake of as much as 20% in the company, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. 

Precious-metals stocks moved higher as the nervousness about the dollar attracted buyers to those issues, usually seen as a safe haven for investors.
Homestake Mining went up 1/4 to 16 5/8 in active trading, Battle Mountain Gold added 1/4 to 15 5/8, American Barrick Resources gained 1 5/8 to 25 1/4, Freeport-McMoRan Gold rose 1/2 to 12 1/8 and Newmont Gold rose 1 3/8 to 37 3/4. 

UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, retreated 7 1/8 to 274.
The Transportation Department asked the company for more data on a planned $300-a-share leveraged buy-out by a labor-management group, because of British Airways' participation in the offer. 

Other airline stocks also fell; the Dow Jones Tranportation Average dropped 20.09 to 1428.17.
AMR, the owner of American Airlines, lost 1 3/8 to 77 7/8 and Delta Air Lines fell 1 to 70 on the Big Board, while Texas Air, the parent of Continental and Eastern airlines, dropped 1 3/8 to 17 on the American Stock Exchange. 

Dividend-related trading swelled volume in Manufacturers Hanover, which eased 5/8 to 42 on 2.7 million shares.
The stock, which carries a 7.8% dividend yield, went ex-dividend yesterday. 

Oryx Energy, which agreed to sell its stakes in 107 oil and natural gas fields to American Exploration for $114 million, advanced 1/2 to 38.
The company said it expects to post a gain of about $22 million on the sale. 

Lomas Financial, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection for itself and two units, dropped 1 1/4 to 1 7/8 on 1.2 million shares.
Philips Industries surged 4 5/8 to 24 5/8 in active trading.
The company accepted a takeover bid of $25.50 a share from Merrill Lynch Capital Partners. 

Marshall Industries added 1/2 to 18 3/4.
Lodestar Group said it has an 8.8% stake in the company and had suggested previously that Marshall consider a leveraged recapitalization or restructuring. 

The American Stock Exchange Index rose 0.02 to 381.40.
Volume totaled 11,790,000 shares, compared with 10,490,000 Friday.
There were 234 issues advancing, 324 issues declining and 255 unchanged. 

Disappointing forecasts of third-quarter earnings hurt Riedel Environmental Technologies, which fell 2 5/8 to 16 3/4, and Bush Industries, which dropped 1 3/4 to 10 1/4.
Riedel said its earnings would be significantly lower than the year-earlier level; Bush said earnings would be little changed from a year earlier.
