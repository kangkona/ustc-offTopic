Manufacturers Hanover Corp. said it registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an offering of 12 million common shares.
The registration is part of the company's previously announced sweeping recapitalization plan. 

Of the stock, 10 million shares will be offered in the U.S. by a syndicate led by Morgan Stanley & Co., and two million shares will be offered internationally by a group led by Morgan Stanley International. 

Manufacturers also agreed to sell, for $1.28 billion, a 60% interest in the CIT Group, the bank's nationwide business finance company, to the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. Another initiative is the private placement with Dai-Ichi of approximately 2.7 million newly issued common shares at $45 apiece, for a total of about $120 million.
