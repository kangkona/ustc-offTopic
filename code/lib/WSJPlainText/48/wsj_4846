Sakata Inx Corp., a Japanese maker of printing ink, said it agreed to buy Midland Color Co. of Chicago, the fifth largest U.S. ink maker, for $42 million and that it purchased another U.S. company, Knight Color & Chemicals Co. of Montrose, Minn.
The price of that transaction wasn't disclosed. 

The company also announced the establishment of a joint venture company in Indonesia. 

Sakata Inx officials said the three steps were in line with the company's plans to strengthen its global operations. 

Sakata Inx established a joint venture company in Indonesia called Pt Sakata Inx Indonesia, together with a local publishing company and certain other interests.
Sakata will own 51% of the joint venture in Jakarta.
It will start producing and marketing printing ink in Indonesia next spring.
