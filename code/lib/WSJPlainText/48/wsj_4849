National Heritage Inc., executing an end-run around Southmark Corp. 's management, said it named a dissident Southmark board member as chairman of its two subsidiaries. 

National Heritage said the board of its two subsidiaries also elected five Southmark directors as subsidiary directors, giving Southmark directors six seats on the subsidiaries' 11-member boards. 

The moves, the latest in an ongoing power struggle between National Heritage and Southmark, give Southmark directors control of National Heritage's operating assets.
But it does so without the approval of Southmark's board or its chairman and chief executive officer, Arthur G. Weiss. 

As previously reported, Southmark, which owns 62.5% of National Heritage, launched a proxy fight to take control of National Heritage's board and stop a proposed spinoff of two units to National Heritage shareholders. 

National Heritage, a manager of nursing homes and retirement centers, said it hasn't been able to negotiate a settlement with Southmark.
Elected chairman of the two subsidiaries was Herbert B. Parks.
Mark W. Branigan, Bob J. Gaydon and two other Southmark directors -- who haven't yet accepted the seats -- were elected to the boards. 

In an interview, Mr. Parks said the new subsidiary boards probably will proceed with the proposed spinoffs of National Heritage Medical Resources and National Heritage Healthcare Management. 

Southmark said it didn't have any immediate comment on the moves.
