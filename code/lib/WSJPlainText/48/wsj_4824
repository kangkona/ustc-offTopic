PUBLISHING: Joe R. Robinowitz, general manager of WFXT-TV in Boston, was named national editor of TV Guide.
The appointment of Mr. Robinowitz, a former editor in chief of the Boston Herald, follows the resignation Sept. 14 of David Sendler, editor of TV Guide's national features section.
Mr. Sendler, who stayed on as a consulting editor, said he resigned over editorial differences with Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corp. unit, News America Publishing Inc., acquired TV Guide from Walter H. Annenberg and also owns WFXT and the Herald.
