Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. reported that fiscal second-quarter net income rose 21% on an 11% rise in sales. 

The Montvale, N.J., supermarket chain, which operates 1,228 stores in 27 states and Canada, said net income for the 12 weeks ended Sept. 9 was $35.6 million, or 93 cents a share, compared with $29.5 million, or 77 cents a share a year ago.
Sales were $2.59 billion, up from $2.33 billion. 

James Wood, chairman, president and chief executive, said "the first half of 1989 has been essentially on target in terms of our overall results." During the first half, the company opened 13 Superstores, enlarged or remodeled 37 existing units, and closed 26 older, outmoded stores. 

Mr. Wood said the company's equity investment in Isosceles PLC, which controls Gateway PLC, Britain's third-largest food retailer, is a "potentially profitable toehold in the rapidly consolidating U.K. supermarket business." A&P said the estimated quarterly cost of financing its investment in Isosceles was five cents a share. 

For the six months, A&P's profit rose 20% to $81 million, or $2.12 a share, from $67.5 million, or $1.77 a share.
Sales rose 13% to $6.03 billion from $5.33 billion. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, A&P was unchanged at $58.625.
