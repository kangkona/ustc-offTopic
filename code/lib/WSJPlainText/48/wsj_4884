Exchange Bancorp of Chicago said it signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by Algemene Bank Nederland N.V., a Dutch banking concern, for $420 million, or $24 a share. 

Under the agreement, Exchange will be merged with the Dutch concern's Chicago unit, LaSalle National Corp., creating a bank holding company with more than $6 billion in assets, which will operate under the LaSalle National Corp. name. 

Exchange said that certain of its officers and directors, representing slightly more than 35% of its common shares outstanding, have executed purchase option agreements with LaSalle, committing their support to the merger. 

The company said the transaction, which is expected to be completed by the end of January 1990, is subject to regulatory approval and the approval of Exchange shareholders.
