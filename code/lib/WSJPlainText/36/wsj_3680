Insight Communications Co. said it signed an agreement to acquire controlling interest in, and management of, Clyde Cablevision Ltd., the partially built cable television system serving Glasgow, Scotland.
Clyde Cablevision currently serves 5,000 subscribers. 

The acquisition by the closely held company marks the first announcement of a United Kingdom cable investment since Insight said that it is offering its U.S. properties for sale, preferring to concentrate on building a U.K. system. 

Insight has said it is hoping for a price of about $500 million for the systems, which have about 190,000 subscribers.
