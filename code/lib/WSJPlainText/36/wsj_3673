The bias shown in your Sept. 19 article "U.S.
Loses Money on Confiscated Goods" certainly was not due to a lack of information.
The U.S. Customs Service provided you with enough facts to produce a balanced and fair article.
The opening line, "It sounds incredible, even for a boondoggler like Uncle Sam," set the stage for the act to follow -- a play, in our view, with no substance. 

For the record, let me repeat as we have on many occasions: In 1985, the Customs Service, in response to recommendations by Congress and the General Accounting Office, negotiated a national contract with Northrop Corp. to provide a more efficient and effective means of disposing of seized properties.
The contract, which freed customs officers from the sales routine, allowed our agents and inspectors the time needed to focus on their primary mission -- facilitating trade and interdicting drugs and other contraband.
Through the procedure of contracting out for these services, the government has gained $9.8 million in the three years of the contract, which includes assets retained or shared with other law-enforcement agencies. 

Contrary to your story's implications, the Customs Service has welcomed the investigation by the Justice Department, and is cooperating fully.
In fact, Customs is supplying all the funds and some support personnel needed for the probe, which is under the guidance of Robert Wortham, U.S. attorney in Beaumont, Texas. 

The life of the contract is being audited by Customs itself, and any costs found neither allowable nor allocable will be reimbursed to the government by the vendor. 

Mr. Wortham's investigation centers on allegations of inaccurate and unsubstantiated expenses billed to the Customs Service by Northrop.
The Customs Service will continue to support all efforts to clarify the issue and will act accordingly, based on the U.S. attorney's findings.
