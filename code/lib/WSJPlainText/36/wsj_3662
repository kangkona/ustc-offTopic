A Sept. 5 Labor Letter item says, "A New Vibrometer looks like a promising tool to detect symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome . . . {by measuring} early stages of median-nerve pressure that causes loss of sensation." This loss of sensation in reality occurs only in the later stages of carpal tunnel syndrome after significant damage already has occurred.
In addition, the accuracy of vibratory testing may vary because it is affected by the presence or absence of calluses on the skin. 

Newer diagnostic technology, which employs an electrical stimulus to determine neuroselective current perception thresholds (CPTs), allows for the detection of inflamed or irritated nerves in the earliest stages of carpal tunnel syndrome -- before there is a loss of sensation and nerve function.
The CPT evaluation of the hand for industrial screening for carpal tunnel syndrome is a painless, easy procedure that requires less than five minutes, and it is not affected by calluses.
The advantage of this procedure is that it allows earlier therapeutic intervention to prevent significant damage, rather than simply measuring damage that already has occurred.
Early intervention in the course of carpal tunnel syndrome and subsequent modification of workplace ergonomics can help eliminate the need for surgery.
