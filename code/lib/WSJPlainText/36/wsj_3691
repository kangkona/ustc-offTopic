Sterling Motor Cars, a unit of Britain's Rover Group PLC, is offering current owners of its cars a $2,000 rebate on 1989-model Sterlings.
The offer is in addition to discounts of $3,500 to $5,000 already being offered on Sterling models. 

The new rebate comes as Sterling struggles to reverse a steep sales slide.
U.S. sales of Sterling models are down 37% for the year through Aug. 31, and August sales were off 67% from the same month a year ago.
The company said all of its current rebates are due to end Nov. 30.
