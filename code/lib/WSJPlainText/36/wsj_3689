Divi Hotels N.V. said it completed the previously announced sale to Palmer Group of the Divi Divi Beach Resort and the Divi Tamarijn Beach Resort in Aruba for $62 million. 

Palmer, which is paying $30 million in cash and $32 million in a subordinated note, also received $7.5 million in time-share receivables and warrants convertible into 25% of the common stock of Divi.
Palmer is a New York-based investment group led by Frank Palmer. 

Divi, which will continue to manage the hotels under a long-term agreement, said the transaction enables it to pay down debt and focus on managing its resorts.
