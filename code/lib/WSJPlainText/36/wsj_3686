International Multifoods Corp. said it sold its Canadian subsidiary, Stafford Foods Ltd., to Thomas J. Lipton Inc., a unit of Unilever Canada Ltd. Terms weren't disclosed. 

The food concern said the sale of Toronto-based Stafford, which employs about 135 workers, is part of the restructuring of its Canadian operations. 

Stafford Foods, which has annual sales of about $15 million, makes and markets dry soup mixes, diet foods, coffee, spices, and flavorings. 

The company's Robin Hood Multifoods unit will continue to produce pie fillings, bakery mixes and toppings previously sold under the Stafford Foods label.
