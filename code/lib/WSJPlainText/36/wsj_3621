The bond market ended narrowly mixed in quiet trading as investors awaited news about the economy and foreign interest rates. 

The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was nominally lower while the yield was unchanged at 8.16%.
Corporate, mortgage-backed and tax-exempt municipal bonds were unchanged to as much as 1/4 point higher, or up about $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. 

In the junk bond market, the trend among portfolio managers to separate "good" junk from "bad" junk continued.
Pittsburgh-based Joy Technologies Inc. offered $120 million of seven-year resettable senior secured notes, priced at par to yield 13%.
Traders said the notes were well-received.
That was welcome news to junk bond underwriters who have watched with trepidation as several new high-yield bond issues have been postponed or scaled back.
On Tuesday, for example, Salomon Brothers Inc. postponed a $400 million junk offering by Aztar Corp. after investors shunned the securities.
Aztar was formed to operate Ramada Inc. 's gambling operation. 

In the broader market, the focus was upon West Germany's central bank, or the Bundesbank.
Today, the Bundesbank is widely expected to raise two key lending rates: the discount rate, which it charges member banks for loans, and the Lombard rate, the effective ceiling on overnight loans.
The rates are now 5% and 7%, respectively. 

"It's a foregone conclusion they're going to raise rates," said Heinrich Ackermann, an economist at Bank Liechtenstein G.m.b.
H. in Frankfurt.
Most bond dealers were expecting increases of at least 1/2 percentage point and perhaps as much as one full percentage point.
As justification for the move, the West German central bank will likely cite concern about inflation. 

Bundesbank officials believe that a tax cut in January contributed to this year's rising inflation.
They fear that a second cut, scheduled to take effect at the start of 1990, will accelerate inflation. 

A secondary concern for the Bundesbank is the U.S. dollar, which has become uncomfortably firm against most major currencies. 

In the U.S., analysts said the market's reaction to a possible rate increase will depend upon the size of the increase. 

James Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc., said a rise of 1/2 percentage point would be too small to rein in the dollar.
In fact, "I think the dollar would trade up a bit and that would take U.S. bonds higher," he said.
That's because it is widely believed that an increase of one percentage point is needed to fight both inflation and the dollar, while a smaller increase could be interpreted as a sign that the Federal Reserve has agreed to a coordinated move with the Bundesbank by allowing rates in the U.S. to fall by 1/2 percentage point. 

For some time now, several officials at the Federal Reserve, including Chairman Alan Greenspan, have maintained that controlling the value of the dollar isn't a major priority.
And many U.S. economists have long stopped speculating about lower rates. 

However, Federal Reserve Governor Martha Seger implied yesterday that she would be more comfortable with an easier monetary policy. 

"I will say again, being from the Midwest and having a general interest in keeping an American manufacturing base, I am very concerned about the {strong} dollar" hurting the competitive position of U.S. exporters, Mrs. Seger said. "I have favored easing monetary policy to allow interest rates to be somewhat lower and weaken the dollar," she said.
But Mrs. Seger's views aren't always shared by her colleagues at the Fed. 

Whatever happens today, "the German decision will set the jumping-off point for how we trade on the employment report," said Mr. Capra. 

The Department of Labor will release the potentially market-moving employment report tomorrow.
Economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Reports expect, on average, a 279,000 rise in September nonfarm payrolls.
The consensus of estimates by 21 economists is for a 5.2% civilian unemployment rate, unchanged from August. 

The employment statistics are considered significant because they will provide an early glimpse of how the economy fared last month. 

Treasury Securities 

Treasury bonds were narrowly mixed in light trading.
The benchmark 30-year bond fell 1/16 of a point, or about 62 cents for each $1,000 face amount.
The bond was quoted late at a price of 99 14/32 to yield 8.16% compared with 99 16/32 to yield 8.16%.
The latest 10-year notes were quoted at 98 15/32 to yield 8.21% compared with 98 17/32 to yield 8.20% 

News that the Treasury will sell $7.50 billion seven-year notes didn't come as a surprise to the market, analysts said.
The amount was up roughly $210 million from the last similar sale in July, continuing a recent pattern of increasing note and bill sale sizes to help the Treasury raise funds for the thrift industry bailout. 

In when-issued trading activity, the new seven-year notes were quoted at a yield of 8.24%. 

Short-term rates rose slightly.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.79% for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.04% while the discount rate on six-month Treasury bills rose to 7.88% for a yield of 8.30%. 

Investors continue to speculate about the size and timing of Resolution Funding Corp. 's first bond offering.
Refcorp is a new agency created to fund the savings and loan bailout.
Its initial bond offering has been expected during the first half of October, but Treasury Undersecretary Robert Glauber said yesterday only that his department expects Refcorp to begin tapping the capital markets during the fourth quarter of 1989.
He said details have yet to be decided. 

Corporate Issues 

Corporate bonds closed slightly higher. 

In the high-yield market, junk bonds of Integrated Resources Inc. tumbled early in the day-even before the financial services firm announced it agreed to Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. 's acquisition of its United Resources subsidiary. 

Dealers said Integrated junk issues recovered slightly by the end of the session, but many of the issues never managed to entirely erase their losses of the day. 

Integrated's 13 1/8% senior subordinated notes of 1995 traded at the 6 1/2 level this session after trading around 8 Tuesday, dealers said.
The company's 10 3/4% senior subordinated notes of 1996 fell 1/8 to close at 7 1/8. 

Integrated said Metropolitan Life will acquire a segment of Integrated Resources Life Insurance Co. 's flexible annuity assets totaling $565 million.
Under this agreement, Met Life said it will reinsure and guarantee existing contracts. 

Meanwhile, more than $900 million in new corporate debt was issued yesterday, including $330 million of 15-year zero-coupon notes by Sysco Corp.
The notes, which are convertible into common stock at $32.4156 a share, were priced to yield 6.25%. 

Foreign Bonds 

West German government bonds were unchanged to slightly lower as investors braced for a possible increase in interest rates. 

The policy-making committee of West Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, meets today and is widely expected to boost the discount and Lombard rates between 1/2 and one percentage point.
The rates are now 5% and 7%, respectively.
The Lombard rate is the effective ceiling on overnight bank loans. 

Some bond dealers argue that the small allocation of securities repurchase agreements, a technical trading operation executed by the Bundesbank, points to a full-point increase and that a 1/2 point increase would be interpreted negatively.
Those arguing for a 1/2 point rise say West Germany's European partners, who most likely would follow with increases of their own, would be reluctant to move a full point. 

The Bundesbank drained a net 8.8 billion marks ($4.66 billion) in repurchase agreements while allocating money well above the 7% Lombard rate.
The allocation marked the end of an early-morning firming trend but didn't push prices down dramatically. 

West Germany's 6 3/4% issue due 1999 ended at 98.20, down 0.05 point to yield 7%. 

Elsewhere: 

-- Britain's 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007 fell 18/32 point to 111 6/32 to yield 10.18%, while the 12% notes due 1995 were down 10/32 point to 102 27/32 to yield 11.24%. 

-- Japan's benchmark No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers' screens at 96.02, up 0.03.
The yield was 5.265%. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities 

Mortgage securities generally ended 2/32 higher after moderate trading. 

Dealers said there were a number of sizable trades of $50 million to $100 million, including a thrift sale of less than $100 million of pass-through securities. 

Among major issues, Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for October delivery finished at 97 6/32, up 2/32; and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9% securities closed at 96 11/32, also up 2/32. 

Mortgage issues fared slightly better than Treasurys.
The Ginnie Mae 9% securities were yielding 9.52% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note narrowed .01 percentage point to 1.32. 

Municipals 

The municipal market's solid technical position kept a floor under prices Wednesday, helping to leave active issues flat to 1/4 point higher in late dealings. 

The session was the seventh in which seasoned dollar bond issues have been quoted higher at the day's end. 

Market participants said players were being cautious ahead of Friday's report on September employment. 

New Jersey Turnpike Authority 7.20% issue of 2018 was locked at 97 3/4, up 1/8 from late Tuesday's bid of 97 5/8.
The yield was 7.39%.
