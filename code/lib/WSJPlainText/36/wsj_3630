The Senate confirmed the nomination of Richard Breeden as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, after receiving unanimous recommendation from the Senate Banking Committee. 

The 39-year-old Mr. Breeden, who was tapped by President Bush for the post, will succeed David Ruder, who left the commission last week. 

Mr. Breeden, who was a key player in the savings-and-loan bailout legislation, is likely to bring the agency closer to the White House than it has been in years.
He also supports tough enforcement, a breakdown of the Glass-Steagall rules separating investment banking and commercial banking, and better communication between regulators. 

Mr. Breeden will have a rare opportunity to shape the commission early in his term since one seat is open and another commissioner, Joseph Grundfest, will leave early next year.
Moreover, he will appoint an enforcement director to succeed Gary Lynch, who left the SEC in July. 

Meanwhile, the Senate Labor Committee voted for confirmation of Gerard Scannell to be assistant secretary of labor for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
Mr. Scannell, 54, was formerly safety and environmental director for Johnson & Johnson.
