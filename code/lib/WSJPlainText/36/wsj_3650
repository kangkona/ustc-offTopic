Electricity consumption in Italy rose an unadjusted 3.7% in September from a year earlier and was up 4.5% for the first nine months, according to figures released by Enel, the state electricity utility. 

Enel said when the figures are adjusted to reflect 21 working days in September against 22 the prior year, the increase is estimated to be 4.2% in September and 4.9% for the first nine months. 

Enel said electricity use, which can be used to indicate industrial activity, rose most sharply in the southern regions of Campania and Sicily, where consumption was up 7.1%.
