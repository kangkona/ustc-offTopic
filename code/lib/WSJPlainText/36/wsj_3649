Interleaf Inc. said it expects to report a loss of about $1 million, or eight cents a share, for the second quarter ended Saturday. 

The company's net income was $123,000, or one cent a share, a year earlier. 

The maker of computerized typesetting systems attributed the expected loss to a backlog of orders caused by a lack of available hardware and to a delay in closing a contract.
