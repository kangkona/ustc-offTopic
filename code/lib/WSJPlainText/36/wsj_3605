Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. could face a hefty payout on a stake in its Bell Group Ltd. unit that is being sold by the State Government Insurance Commission of Western Australia. 

The insurance commission said Wednesday that it is offering for sale by tender a 19.9% stake in Bell Group. 

Bond Corp. in June 1988 guaranteed the Insurance Commission 2.7 Australian dollars (US$2.10) a share for the Bell Group stake.
Since then, though, Bell Group shares have plunged to 46 Australian cents on the stock market. 

Bond, an Australian brewing, media, property and resources group caught in a cash squeeze, hasn't said if it will bid for the insurance panel's Bell Group stake. 

But under the indemnity, Bond might have to make up the difference between what the Insurance Commission gets for the stake and the guaranteed price.
That difference at current market prices would total about 140 million Australian dollars. 

Bell Group's main assets are the West Australian newspaper in Perth and an interest in Bell Resources Ltd. Bond owns about 70% of Bell.
