Blackstone Capital Partners Limited Partnership said it received Interstate Commerce Commission authorization for its purchase of CNW Corp., effective Oct. 9. 

The ICC approval of the purchase of the railroad-holding company was needed as a result of the ownership by Blackstone, an investment company, and its affiliates of Transtar, which owns seven railroads in the Midwest and Pennsylvania.
