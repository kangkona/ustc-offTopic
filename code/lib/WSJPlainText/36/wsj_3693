I.C.H. Corp., hoping to increase its book value and cash flow, said it agreed to sell certain insurance operations to Hicks, Muse & Co., a private Dallas-based investment firm, for $495 million. 

The insurance-holding company also said it will sell its Great Southern Life Insurance Co. to Financial Holding Corp., Kansas City, Mo., for $145 million. 

Robert T. Shaw, chairman of I.C.H., said the transactions were part of a restructuring effort to increase the value of the company's stock.
Proceeds will be used to repay debt and repurchase stock, he said. 

For Hicks Muse, the sale salvages an earlier attempt to acquire the company.
Last August, majority holders of I.C.H. rejected an offer of $8.50 a share, or $408 million.
The I.C.H. board, however, left the door open for another attempt by Hicks Muse by announcing that it was still soliciting offers. 

Under the agreement, Hicks Muse will acquire Dallas-based Philadelphia Life Insurance Co. and Denver-based insurance operations -- Wabash Life Insurance Co., All American Life Insurance Co. and Chase National Life Insurance Co.
The companies combined have assets of about $2 billion. 

I.C.H. said it will purchase $35 million of preferred stock and 19% of common stock of HMS Acquisition, the purchasing company for Hicks Muse. 

I.C.H. will still retain its two chief insurance companies -- Bankers Life and Southwestern Life -- which accounted for 73% of the company's assets. 

The announcement of the sale came after the stock market closed.
In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange, I.C.H. stock closed at $5.25, down 12.5 cents.
