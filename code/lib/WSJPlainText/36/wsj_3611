Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. said it agreed to buy a subsidiary of Integrated Resources Inc. that is geared to selling financial products to nonprofit organizations. 

Terms weren't disclosed.
But Ted Athanassiades, Met Life executive vice president in charge of pension operations, said there wouldn't be any up-front fee paid to Integrated.
Rather, he said, Met Life agreed to pay Integrated a fee on United Resources' existing business each year for the next 10 years, as well as an annual fee on new business written over the next five years. 

United Resources, which isn't an Integrated core business, primarily sells tax-sheltered annuities to nonprofit organizations, mostly teachers' groups.
Met Life agreed to assume United Resources tax-sheltered annuity assets totaling $565 million; Met Life will reinsure and guarantee those contracts.
Additionally, Met Life is acquiring a sales force of 300 to 400 people.
United Resources is based in Santa Ana, Calif., and its management apparently will remain.
The transaction is expected to close in November. 

Mr. Athanassiades said the agreement represents basically an entry into a new market for Met Life, which has $11.5 billion in individual pension assets under management.
Mr. Athanassiades said he expects Met Life to build this business and become one of the top three in selling tax-sheltered annuities to nonprofit organizations. 

Integrated, a financial-services company that has been trying to restructure its debt since June, agreed in August to sell five of its core businesses to Whitehall Financial Group for $310 million.
Integrated announced its intention to sell United Resources and other businesses in June, when it failed to make interest payments on nearly $1 billion of debt.
Integrated is still trying to sell its ordinary block of business at its life-insurance company and its Capitol Life Insurance unit, a person close to Integrated said.
