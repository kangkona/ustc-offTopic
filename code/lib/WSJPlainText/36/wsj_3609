Two businessmen, one from Boston and the other from Britain, were arrested on charges of conspiring to export $178,000 of high-tech equipment to England without a valid export license, according to the U.S. attorney's office here. 

James Gato, former vice president of Bay State Computer Group Inc. in Boston, and Ebrahim Shad, director of Overseas Hybrid Systems Ltd., a British company, allegedly conspired between April and December of 1988 to export equipment restricted by the U.S. government for national-security reasons. 

The case is being investigated by special agents of the Department of Commerce, the Office of Export Enforcement and the Customs Service. 

Mr. Gato and Mr. Shad couldn't be reached for comment.
