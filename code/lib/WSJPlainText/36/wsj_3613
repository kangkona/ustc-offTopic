The government accused four cities of allowing the discharge of untreated industrial pollutants into public sewage systems. 

The cities are Phoenix, Ariz.; El Paso and San Antonio, Texas, and Detroit. 

The suits, filed by the Justice Department on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency, allege that the cities have violated the Clean Water Act, which requires cities to control industrial discharges into their sewage-treatment systems. 

San Antonio has settled its suit by agreeing to pay a $225,000 penalty and to develop new enforcement procedures.
The suits against the other cities seek injunctions and civil penalties, but EPA officials said they expect them to settle as well. 

EPA Administrator William Reilly was joined in a news conference by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to announce the four suits and 57 other actions the EPA has taken since January, many of which have already been settled. 

The EPA estimates that more than one-third of U.S. cities are allowing industries to dump hazardous pollutants directly into public sewage.
About 700,000 tons of industrial waste is released each year and as much as 39% of it goes untreated into public waterways.
