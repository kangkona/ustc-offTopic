Swedish office-supplies concern Esselte AB said it is in preliminary talks toward acquiring the 22% it doesn't own of its U.S. unit, Esselte Business Systems Inc. 

Hans Larsson, Esselte chief executive officer, said negotiations with an independent committee of EBS outside directors began Tuesday and are expected to continue 10 more days.
If Esselte and the directors' committee agree on a price, the Swedish concern would proceed with a so-called minority squeeze-out, or compulsory purchase of the remaining EBS shares outstanding, Mr. Larsson said. 

Esselte said "any proposal would be on the order of $40 a share" for the 4.9 million EBS shares, fully diluted, currently owned by private investors.
The parent company added there is "no assurance that any transaction will occur." 

Esselte issued the statement Tuesday in response to widespread market speculation about an imminent bid for EBS, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
EBS shares rose 62.5 cents to $37.875 Tuesday on the Big Board in unusually high volume, but trading was halted during the session's final 90 minutes. 

When trading resumed yesterday, EBS shares immediately surged $4.875 to $42.75, a signal that investors consider Esselte's "indicated" $40 price too low.
The unit closed at $43 a share, up $5.125. 

Esselte sold the minority EBS stake five years ago in a $40 million international share offering.
EBS, which is the holding company for Esselte's non-Swedish units, accounted for 58% of sales and 71% of operating profit last year. 

Taking EBS public originally was intended as a way to circumvent Sweden's tough foreign-exchange controls, Stockholm market analysts said.
At the time, a foreign-based and independently quoted unit could borrow and issue shares much more freely in international markets than its Swedish parent.
But abolition of Swedish exchange controls early this year eliminated the need for such a financing vehicle, these analysts said.
