LVI Group Inc. said its Nico Inc. unit completed a $51.3 million private debt offering with a group of companies, which also received a stake in LVI. 

The interior-construction and asbestos-removal company said the group was led by an insurance concern, but LVI wouldn't identify the insurer and the other members of the group. 

LVI said it had been in violation over net worth in a debt covenant, but that this influx of new funds cures that breach, as well as providing working capital. 

Under the offering, the group of companies received $51.3 million principal amount of senior secured notes issued by Nico, LVI's main operating unit.
The group also received one million LVI common shares, or slightly less than 5% of LVI common.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, LVI common rose 12.5 cents to close at $1.375 a share. 

LVI's asbestos-removal business, which it entered in 1986, has been unprofitable, while its core interior-construction business has been hurt by an industrywide slowdown.
In the second quarter, LVI had an operating loss of $3.9 million.
