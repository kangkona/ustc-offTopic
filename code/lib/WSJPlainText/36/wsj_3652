The Venezuelan consumer price index rose 3.3% in September, with the year's accumulated inflation rate hitting 70.4%, the nation's central bank reported. 

Prices rose 2.2% in August.
Inflation has slowed during the past few months after it surged to 21.3% in March, when the government lifted price controls and eliminated most subsidies as part of an economic-reform plan. 

Inflation in 1988 was 35.2%.
This year's rate is expected to be the highest ever in this oil-producing country.
