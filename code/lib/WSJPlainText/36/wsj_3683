The major drug companies have made much of revelations that two generics makers gave gratuities to officials of the FDA. But, it turns out, at least one brand-name company can be accused of the same transgression. 

A former official with Warner-Lambert Co. gave gifts in 1987 to two of the three FDA employees who resigned this year for accepting illegal gratuities from generic drug companies and executives.
Milton R. Kaplan, who was head of regulatory affairs for Warner-Lambert, disclosed to congressional investigators that he bought a $415 video-cassette recorder as a housewarming gift for Charles Chang and a $119 telephone as a wedding gift for David Brancato.
Messrs.
Chang and Brancato reviewed drug applications for the FDA. 

Mr. Kaplan says the gifts had nothing to do with his position at Warner-Lambert, where he was involved in submitting drug applications to the FDA for the company's Parke-Davis unit and for its Warner-Chilcott generic drug division.
Mr. Kaplan left the company earlier this year. 

"I didn't do anything wrong," Mr. Kaplan says. "I've been thoroughly investigated." Mr. Kaplan's lawyer says his client isn't the target of any criminal inquiry and that he is cooperating with authorities.
He says the gifts were merely expressions of personal friendship.
He declines to say why Mr. Kaplan left his job at Warner-Lambert. 

In Morris Plains, N.J., a spokesman for Warner-Lambert says Mr. Kaplan's gifts exceeded company guidelines, noting that any gifts "beyond a very token level" would violate company policies.
