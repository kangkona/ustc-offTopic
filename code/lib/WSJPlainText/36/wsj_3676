Logan Aluminum Inc., a joint venture of Atlantic Richfield Co. and Alcan Aluminum Corp., said it plans to spend about $280 million to expand its sheet-rolling facilities here. 

Although the capacity of the mills weren't disclosed, the company said the expansion would double its output of aluminum sheets, which are used to make beverage cans, among other things. 

Most of the expansion will be funded and owned by Alcan, the company said.
Alcan is a unit of Montreal-based Alcan Aluminium Ltd.
