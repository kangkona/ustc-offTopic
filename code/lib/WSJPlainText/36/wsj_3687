First Chicago Corp. said it completed the sale of its First Chicago Investment Advisors money management subsidiary to Brinson Partners Inc., a company formed by managers of the unit. 

Under the sale agreement, the bank holding company received $70 million in cash, a $15 million subordinated note and a 10% stake in the new company.
In addition, the money management unit paid a dividend of about $17 million to First Chicago last week. 

First Chicago said it will realize a pretax third-quarter gain of about $60 million on the sale.
