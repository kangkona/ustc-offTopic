It was with some surprise that I read your Sept. 11 article "ROTC Regains Respect on Campuses as Graduates Fare Well in Workplace," saying ROTC enrollment peaked "in the 1962-63 academic year as many students sought to avoid being drafted and sent to Vietnam as enlisted men." That statement makes about as much sense as attributing the current rise to student concerns about a war in Colombia in 1992. 

During the fall and winter of 1962, when there were only about 3,000 military personnel in Vietnam, the only thoughts of active duty I and my classmates in ROTC had was the hope by some that we would be called up for active duty in the Cuban missile crisis prior to final exams.
Even by January 1965, six months before graduation and commissioning as an Army second lieutenant and a year before my own arrival in Vietnam, there were only about 30,000 military personnel "in country." 

The draft-avoidance connotation is insulting.
As I am sure with the present peacetime members of ROTC, most of us joined for the opportunity of leadership experience.
No corporation gives college graduates as much responsibility as the military does: the very lives of their subordinates.
Nor does any ask as much of them: to risk their own lives before the lives of those they lead. 

Despite the surprise that graduation held in store for me, I remain proud of my ROTC commission and military experience.
I still claim that I received my MBA from the U.S. Army.
I would just caution my present-day successors that the price of tuition can be high.
