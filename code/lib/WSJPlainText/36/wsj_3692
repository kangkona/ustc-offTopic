Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater announced yesterday, after all the shooting in Panama City, that the coup against General Manuel Noriega apparently had failed. "Nothing's changed.
Everything remains the same.
We'll continue to press for Noriega's removal" and his arrest to stand trial in the United States on drug charges, Mr. Fitzwater said.
Given the opportunity the coup attempt afforded and the presence of well-trained U.S. troops on the scene, it seems that a golden opportunity to press for that ouster in the most effective way was lost yesterday.
