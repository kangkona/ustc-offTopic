A survey of business conditions and prospects for manufacturers in New South Wales, Australia's largest state, shows a small downturn for the quarter ended Sept. 30 following a similar slip for the quarter ended in June. 

State Bank of New South Wales and the Australian Chamber of Manufacturers, an industry group, surveyed 482 manufacturers in New South Wales.
About 32% of businesses reported a deterioration in business conditions, while 30% reported an improvement. 

State Bank said high interest rates and recent "poor" Australian economic indicators contributed to the result.
