The French government said it appointed Jean Saint-Geours to head the watchdog agency for France's securities and financial markets. 

Mr. Saint-Geours succeeds Jean Farge, who has headed the Commission des Operations de Bourse since July 1988.
Mr. Farge is stepping down for personal reasons. 

Until last July, Mr. Saint-Geours was chairman of the Credit Industriel et Commercial banking group. 

Mr. Farge was appointed president of the agency, known as the COB, a few months before its independence and policing powers were questioned as the result of an insider-trading scandal involving the takeover of Triangle Industries Inc. of the U.S. by France's state-owned Pechiney aluminum group. 

The Triangle scandal prompted the French government to widen the COB's powers of investigation, although the agency still can't bring a case to court on its own behalf.
