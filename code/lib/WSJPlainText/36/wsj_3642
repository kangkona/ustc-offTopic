Trade among the Association of Southeast Nations members has grown an average 14% a year during the past 10 years, according to Radius Prawiro, Indonesia's coordinating minister for economy, finance and trade. 

"In Indonesia's case, for instance, imports from Asean countries have grown 35% in just over a three-year period and its imports have experienced similar growth during that duration," he said at the opening of the fourth Asean trade fair.
Asean members are Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines and Brunei.
