Peter Gumbel's Sept. 13 page-one story on possible coup conditions in the Soviet Union was fascinating and crucial, as have been so many of his articles from that difficult area of the world. 

I felt as if I were standing in the grim grocery store Mr. Gumbel describes with such meaningful detail.
I could appreciate why the elderly man who came in resignedly left. 

The story is important in pointing to events that may take place -- not simply covering what already has occurred.
