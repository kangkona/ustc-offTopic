The New York Mercantile Exchange named R. Patrick Thompson president, succeeding Rosemary T. McFadden, who resigned in July. 

Mr. Thompson, 40 years old, was executive vice president at the exchange and has been serving as chief of staff since Ms. McFadden's resignation. 

Ms. McFadden was forced to quit in July amid a power struggle at the exchange, the world's major oil-futures marketplace.
Ms. McFadden, who was president since 1984, signed a contract as a "special adviser" to the exchange after her ouster. 

The 117-year-old New York Merc is the third-largest futures exchange in the U.S. and the largest futures market in New York.
It trades the benchmark crude-oil futures contract, as well as heating oil, gasoline, platinum and palladium. 

Z. Lou Guttman, exchange chairman, said a "rigorous search" was made before Mr. Thompson was tapped for the presidency.
He cited Mr. Thompson's "extensive operational and regulatory management skills and expertise." 

The new president faces several challenges.
A priority of the exchange has been devising an after-hours electronic-trading system to boost business from overseas.
Also, the exchange, criticized for the relatively few disciplinary cases it has brought against member traders, recently overhauled its compliance department and pledged to impose stiffer fines.
