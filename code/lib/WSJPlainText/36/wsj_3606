ELSINORE Corp. of Las Vegas, Nev., said its finance unit will redeem on Nov. 2 $55 million of its 15 1/2% senior mortgage bonds due 1999 and their accrued and unpaid interest, together with the 1989 coupon attached to the bonds. 

Elsinore, a casino-hotel operator, said the redemption price is about $1,042.72 per $1,000 face amount of each bond and about 546.18 common shares of Elsinore per $1,000 face amount of each bond.
The bonds are being redeemed in accordance with an order by the U.S. bankruptcy court in New Jersey in connection with the sale of Elsinore's Atlantis Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, N.J., to New York real-estate investor Donald Trump.
