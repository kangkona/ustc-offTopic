Heck's Inc. said it emerged from federal bankruptcy-law protection and changed the name of its stores to Take 10 Discount Club. 

Heck's, which operates 55 discount stores, also said its stock began trading over-the-counter today under the symbol HEXX. Heck's will continue to be traded on the Midwest Stock Exchange. 

The company said the new name of its stores reflects the marketing strategy of offering 10% off all products.
So far, about half the stores have begun the so-called Take 10 discount program. 

Two years ago Heck's filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, under which a company continues to operate, shielded from creditor suits, as it devises a debt-payment plan.
Since then, Heck's has undergone a major restructuring.
