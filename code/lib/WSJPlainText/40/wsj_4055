MicroBilt Corp. said it and H&R Block Inc. were unable to reach agreement on the terms of an amendatory accord and have terminated merger plans. 

The plans had called for MicroBilt shareholders to receive $18 in value of Block common stock for each MicroBilt common share.
Block said that in settlement MicroBilt agreed to reimburse it a certain amount, which wasn't disclosed. 

MicroBilt also said it received an unsolicited proposal from another publicly traded company for a merger that would provide stock from that concern at a value greater than MicroBilt's common-stock closing price of $14.75 last Thursday, but less than $18. 

In July, Block said it had agreed to acquire the data-communications equipment concern for about $144 million in stock.
