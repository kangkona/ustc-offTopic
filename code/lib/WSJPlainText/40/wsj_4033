Compagnie Industriali Riunitie S.p.
A., a key holding company of the De Benedetti financial empire, said group pretax profit doubled in the first six months to 124.6 billion lire ($91 million) from 62.1 billion lire a year earlier. 

CIR reported the increase on aggregate sales of 7.68 trillion lire in the same period.
It didn't provide year-earlier aggregate sales figures. 

A CIR spokesman couldn't immediately be reached to explain the large jump in profits. 

Among significant events for the concern in the first half was American Telephone & Telegraph Co. 's agreement to take an 18.6% stake in CIR in exchange for its 22% holding in office equipment manufacturer Ing C. Olivetti & Co. CIR raised its interests in Olivetti to 41% as a result of the agreement. 

CIR said earnings rose 38% in the first half to 61.2 billion lire from 44.3 billion lire the year before.
