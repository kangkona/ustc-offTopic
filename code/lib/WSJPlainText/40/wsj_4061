Richfield International Holdings Ltd. said it plans to build a $300 million hotel, condominium, office and retail complex on a site it purchased last year in central Los Angeles. 

Y.S. Lo, the property investment group's chairman and managing director, said the move will be financed either with bank loans or through outside equity. 

Among facilities called for in the two million square-foot development is a five-star hotel with 500 rooms and parking for 4,000 cars.
