Societa Finanziaria Telefonica S.p.
A. (STET) said in Milan, Italy, that parent company pretax profit soared 109% in the first six months to 613 billion lire ($447 million) from 293 billion lire ($213 million) a year earlier.
The increase largely reflected a one-time gain of 182 billion lire from the sale of a 20% stake in telecommunications equipment company Italtel to American Telephone & Telegraph Co., STET said. 

Net of extraordinary gains, the increase in pretax profit amounted to 47% in the first six months. 

The state-controlled holding company for the telecommunications industry also reported the pretax profit gain was struck on a 13% increase in consolidated revenue to 8.774 trillion lire in the first half.
