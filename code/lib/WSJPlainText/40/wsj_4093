Preussag AG announced plans to acquire the Salzgitter AG steelmaking and engineering group from the West German government for a price reportedly exceeding two billion marks ($1.06 billion). 

Preussag, which has widespread metals trading, energy and engineering interests, said the takeover would create a metals and engineering conglomerate with 70,000 employees world-wide. 

Preussag and Salzgitter are roughly equal in size, with combined annual sales of about 27 billion marks. 

Salzgitter's losses had been a drain on Bonn's treasury until a restructuring turned it around last year.
Salzgitter resumed dividend payments to the government in the year ended Saturday, and it began repaying federal subsidies. 

A West German Finance Ministry spokesman said the management boards of Preussag and Salzgitter have agreed to the transaction.
The plan now must be approved by the companies' supervisory boards and the West German Parliament.
Federal antitrust authorities aren't expected to raise objections. 

"We had been waiting until Salzgitter was healthy and ready for sale, and this has occurred," the Finance Ministry spokesman said.
This week's edition of Der Spiegel magazine reported that Preussag would pay Bonn more than two billion marks for Salzgitter.
Corporate and government officials declined to confirm or deny the reported price. 

The Preussag transaction has emerged as an alternative to plans by Fried.
Krupp G.m.b.
H., a steel and engineering concern, to acquire Salzgitter.
Those plans fell apart amid political opposition from the state government of Lower Saxony, where Salzgitter is based, which feared job cuts if Krupp became Salzgitter's owner. 

Preussag didn't disclose its financing arrangements, but it is expected to rely heavily on a big shareholder, Westdeutsche Landesbank, which owns 45% of the metals concern.
