Ford Motor Co. followed the other Big Three auto makers by putting incentives on four 1990 model cars and light trucks. 

The companies are slapping incentives on 1990 models just as they reach the showrooms to keep sales from diving in the fourth quarter.
Already, the domestic auto makers have cut back production schedules and idled plants to match sagging sales expectations. 

The widely expected move by Ford follows similar actions by Chrysler Corp. and General Motors Corp., which unveiled incentives in five of its six divisions.
The Ford incentive program is, for now at least, more limited in scope than the GM program. 

The Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz each will have $600 cash rebates, the Ford Ranger, a $1,000 rebate, and the Ford Bronco II, a $1,250 rebate.
Low-interest-rate financing is also available as an option to cash rebates on all four models.
