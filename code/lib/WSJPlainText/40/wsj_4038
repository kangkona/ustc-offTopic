Health-Chem Corp., a maker of dental supplies, vinyl-laminated fabrics and other products, said it secured a $9 million revolving credit agreement from the Bank of Tokyo Co. 

The company said it had to pledge "substantially all" of its $58 million of assets to obtain the line. 

Asked why Health-Chem had to pledge so much in assets, a company spokesman declined to comment.
However, in Health-Chem's most recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing, it indicated it was having significant financial problems stemming in part from planned capital investments and the anticipated settlement of tax and interest obligations resulting from a prior year's tax audit stipulated agreement. 

In addition, beginning this year, the company has deferred recognition of interest income earned on funds deposited into an escrow account related to a settlement agreement with a former director.
The company agreed in 1987 to pay the former director about $16 million from sale of his shares; at the time the agreement was signed Health-Chem was selling at a significantly higher price than at present.
The shares closed at $2.375 a share Friday in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange. 

As a result, the company's potential obligation under the settlement agreement has run into conflict with debt convenants and the company has sought to renegotiate the settlement.
The director has refused, and the dispute is pending in court. 

Last January, Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered the rating on Health-Chem's convertible subordinated debentures to Caa from single-B-2, citing the company's "thin liquidity" and the litigation with the former director. 

Health-Chem most recently reported second-quarter net income of $170,000, or two cents a share, on revenue of $12.2 million.
That compared with year-earlier net income of $360,000, or five cents a share, on revenue of $10 million.
