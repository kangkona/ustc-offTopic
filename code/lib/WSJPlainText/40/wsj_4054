Goldome Federal Savings Bank said it will realize a gain of more than $50 million with the completion of two previously announced sales. 

Goldome said the sale of 11 of its New York-area branch offices to Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. has been approved by the Federal Reserve Board and by the New York State Department of Banking.
The company said it will post a gain of more than $40 million from that sale in the fourth quarter. 

Goldome also announced the terms of its sale of Goldome Strategic Investments, a subsidiary that specializes in leveraged buy-outs, to GSI Acquisition Co., a limited partnership formed recently by senior management of that unit.
Goldome said the gain from that sale would exceed $10 million in the third quarter of this year.
