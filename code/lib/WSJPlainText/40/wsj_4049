Mobil Chemical Co., a unit of Mobil Corp., said it plans to build a plant in LaGrange, Ga., to make 60 million pounds a year of oriented-polypropylene films, a thin flexible plastic wrap. 

The plant, scheduled to begin operation in late 1991, will employ about 280 people.
It will increase North American capacity to more than 230 million pounds, and more than 340 million pounds world-wide. 

Industry sources estimated the plant could cost approximately $100 million.
