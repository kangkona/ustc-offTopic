US West Inc. said it will post a $39 million pretax charge against third-quarter earnings as a result of a settlement reached with the Minnesota attorney general's office. 

US West had profit of $283 million, or $1.55 a share, on revenue of $2.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. 

The settlement ends a three-year dispute that erupted after US West's Minnesota telephone unit, Northwestern Bell -- now called US West Communications -- was charged with attempting to "wrongfully influence members of the Public Utilities Commission." 

In 1986, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission launched an investigation into the relationship between the utilities and former commissioners, according to Gary R. Cunningham, a Minnesota special assistant attorney general.
The investigation found that US West's telephone unit allegedly tried to influence commissioners while they considered, and ultimately approved, a $57 million rate increase. 

Attorney General Hubert Humphrey III said a US West employee "wined and dined" two commissioners during the rate case. 

Because of the alleged abuse, the commission ordered US West to reduce rates by about $10 million a year in Minnesota.
The US West unit appealed the decision to the Minnesota Court of Appeals, which ruled in 1987 that there was "more than sufficient" evidence that the company had tried to influence commission members. 

The attorney general's office filed suit to recover the money for consumers, which with interest and taxes totals the amount of the settlement. 

US West said it believed "our position was legally justified," but that it was in the "best interests of our shareowners, our customers and our company" to settle the dispute because "litigation can be very expensive."
