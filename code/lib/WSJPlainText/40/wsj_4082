Net sales of mutual funds rose $4.2 billion in August, the best performance in more than two years, led by sales of bond and income funds. 

Stock fund sales exceeded redemptions by $1.1 billion in the month, a less brisk pace than the net sales of $1.3 billion in July.
A year earlier, stock fund net sales declined $910.4 million. 

Bond and income fund net sales picked up in August, increasing $3.1 billion, compared with $2.1 billion in July and a $641 million decline a year earlier. 

Mutual fund assets continued to surge in August, increasing $12.7 billion to a record $949.3 billion; most of the increase came from short-term, or money-market, funds, which rose $9.1 billion to $409.8 billion.
Assets of long-term funds rose $3.7 billion to $539.6 billion. 

The figures are compiled by the Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade group.
Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist for the group, said the latest month's growth in assets of long-term funds reflected "very strong sales," in contrast to recent months when growth mainly reflected rising securities prices.
He said that in August, stock fund assets grew by $4.5 billion while bond and income fund values fell about $4 billion because of falling bond prices. 

For August, sales of stock, bond and income mutual funds totaled $11.7 billion, the highest since August 1987; sales in July were $9.7 billion.
Of the August 1989 sales, $1.3 billion represented reinvested dividends, while redemptions totaled $7.5 billion. 

August sales included a $923.8 million underwriting of Eaton Vance Prime Rate Trust, a fixed-income fund. 

As has been the case for much of the year, sales of relatively conservative growth-and-income funds set the pace for the month, totaling $1.76 billion.
This put them ahead of corporate bond funds, with $1.58 billion, and long-term municipal bond funds, with $1.37 billion. 

Mutual funds in August held $47.2 billion in cash and short-term securities, or 10.2% of assets, compared with 9.9% in July.
