(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

BANK ADS USED TO BOAST SLOGANS like "you have a friend at Chase Manhattan." Today, your friend at the bank is as likely to be a machine as a human being.
At last count, U.S. banks had installed almost 82,000 automatic teller machines.
The world-wide total is 250,000. 

The first banking robot arrived in the U.S. from Britain in 1968, a one-way cash dispenser for first Philadelphia Bank.
New York's Chemical Bank put in a similar machine in 1969 and the same year Atlanta's Citizens & Southern installed a two-way electronic teller.
Seattle-First National built 100 ATMs into the walls of its branches in the early '70s and began touting 24-hour service.
Citibank joined the parade in 1977, with a pair of robots in the vestibules of its 270 branches. 

The mid-1970s saw the ATM starting to boom.
Diebold, the Canton, Ohio, safe builder, had started building ATMs in the U.S. in 1968 and now claims 46% of that market, NCR added its weight in 1973 and says it is the world leader, with a 23% global market share. 

Promotion played a major role.
Atlanta's First National (now owned by Wachovia) began touting "Tillie the All Time Teller" in 1975.
In New York, Citibank and Chemical competed in pushing their electronic bankers. 

Networks that let one bank's cardholders plug into ATMs at others also pushed usage.
The net could cover a city (Citibank), a state (California's Bank of America, with 1,400 ATMs) or the whole country (MasterCard's Cirrus, Visa's Plus).
Stores like Safeway and 7-11 and companies like American Express built their own networks. 

As ATM transactions ballooned from 400,000 in 1975 to more than four billion by 1987, costs dropped.
Booz, Allen & Hamilton found that one ATM transaction, $1.25 in 1975, cost about 37 cents in 1983, matching the average for the 42,000 transactions a human teller makes in a year. 

But you can still find a friend at the bank.
New York's Citibank now has 1,200 ATMs -- and 1,500 human tellers.
