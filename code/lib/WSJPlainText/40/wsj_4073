Campbell Soup Co. is expected to announce today the appointment of R. Edward Glover as president of its Campbell Europe division, which accounts for about two-thirds of the diversified food company's international operations. 

In the newly created position, Mr. Glover will manage the previously announced restructuring of Campbell's operations in Europe.
Campbell believes Europe is critical to its survival in the world food market and has been expanding its operations there in anticipation of a unified European Community market in 1992.
Mr. Glover said he will focus on "strategy instead of pure tactics" and doesn't expect to sell any of Campbell's European operations in the near future. 

Mr. Glover was president of the Nabisco Brands International unit of RJR Nabisco Inc. until Aug. 31.
He oversaw this summer's $2.5 billion sale of virtually all of the unit's operations to BSN S.A. of France as part of the diversified tobacco company's debt-reduction plan.
In an earlier position, Mr. Glover was responsible for pruning Nabisco's Canadian operations. 

Mr. Glover, a longtime friend of Jack Argabright, president of Campbell International, said his parting with RJR was amicable. "RJR is shedding a lot of people as part of the divestiture process," he said. "It was crystal clear back in October that this would be the probable outcome."
