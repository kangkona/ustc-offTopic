In a week that could chart a new course for Europe's TV and film industry, European Community industry ministers are expected to approve by a narrow margin a measure to create a single market in TV broadcasting. 

The measure, known as "Television Without Frontiers," will be discussed by foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg tomorrow. 

The plan, which seeks to remove most barriers to intra-Community broadcasting and trade by the end of 1992, has proved highly controversial because of its non-binding recommendation that a majority of entertainment broadcasts be of European origin.
The U.S. entertainment industry has lobbied strongly against that provision and has threatened to charge the EC with unfair trading practices. 

France is expected to lobby to win support for a binding quota.
But a majority of countries are expected to stick with the less stringent formulation, that a majority of EC material should be used "when practicable." 

The "Television Without Frontiers" directive was a central topic of discussion at a weekend conference here among top European media professionals trying to chart a new course for Europe's audiovisual industry. 

Worried that U.S.-made TV shows and movies will dominate European airwaves even more after 1992, the experts called for urgent new measures to help make the European TV and film industry more competitive on world markets.
Organizers hope that a summary of discussions, to be made today, will lead to a consensus on actions to take.
