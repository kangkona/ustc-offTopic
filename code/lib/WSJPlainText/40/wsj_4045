The House Ways and Means subcommittee on oversight said it will conduct a hearing this month on the financial performance of a program run by Northrop Corp. for the Customs Service.
The subcommittee said an investigation has disclosed that the program, which seizes property from drug dealers and other lawbreakers and then auctions it off, has been operating at a financial loss.
The hearing has been set for Oct. 10. 

"I simply can't understand why a program that is supposed to take the fruits of drug smuggling from the criminals has actually operated to drain scarce law-enforcement dollars from the federal government," said Rep. J.J. Pickle (D., Texas), the subcommittee chairman. 

In a recent story in this newspaper, both Customs and Northrop officials defended their management of the program, saying they are not properly credited for items that are not sold off, but are instead distributed to government agencies for their use. 

Customs plans before next March to competitively award an extension of the contract to run the program.
Northrop, a Los Angeles-based aerospace company, has said it's not interested in bidding on the new pact.
