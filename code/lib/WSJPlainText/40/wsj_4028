From an address by Herbert R. Kleber, deputy director for demand reduction at the federal Office of National Drug Control Policy, at Yale University on Sept. 26: 

{T}he National Drug Control Strategy calls for a 53% increase in federal funding of treatment for fiscal year 1990.
This is the largest single increase for treatment in any given year.
It is important to note here that this is not the last word on funding for treatment, either.
It is only for 1990.
We will return to Congress in February with both a refined National Strategy and a budget for 1991, and we will very likely be asking for more.
We will do the same in '92, and so on. 

From a June speech by Karl D. Bays, chairman of Whitman Corp., in which he called for "a moratorium on new organizations" funded by Chicago companies for community aims: 

Business has a legal and moral responsibility to its owners -- the shareholders -- when it supports worthwhile causes.
Managers don't have the right to arbitrarily reduce profits in the name of sweet charity.
An individual may be motivated by a sense of pure kindness in giving money away.
But shareholders have the right to expect some reasonable relationship to a corporation's goals, whether building good will, promoting the product, enhancing the company's reputation, or improving the quality of life in cities where employees live and work.
And they have a right to expect that any contribution the corporation makes will help solve a problem.
Otherwise, a manager should hold on to the shareholders' money.
We get literally thousands of requests for cash support each year.
But we'd rather give $25,000 to one group that one of our executives is working with, than $500 to 50 organizations where we have no direct involvement.
We like to know that our contribution will make a difference.
