Hudson General Corp. said it will omit its semiannual dividend because its net worth has fallen below the limit allowed under amendments to a $35 million revolving credit accord. 

The airline service company most recently paid its dividend of 20 cents a share on July 21.
The company said its net worth was about $6.9 million as of June 30, below the $12 million allowed under the bank pacts.
Hudson General said it will hold discussions with its banks and will grant the banks "a security interest in all its assets to the extent it is permitted to do so." 

Hudson General also said it had a net loss of $13 million in the year ended June 30, compared with net income of $310,000, or 25 cents a share, a year ago.
The latest year's loss included a loss from continuing operations of $3 million and a loss from discontinued operations of $10 million.
The loss from continuing operations included a pretax charge of about $3.2 million in connection with the sale of the balance of the company's aircraft spare-parts inventory. 

Revenue from continuing operations fell to $116.5 million from $117.1 million.
