Reserve Bank of New Zealand said it has appointed statutory managers for DFC New Zealand Ltd. because the investment bank said it was experiencing serious financial difficulties. 

DFC is 20%-owned by U.S. investment banker Salomon Bros.
Inc. and 80%-owned by New Zealand Government National Provident Fund. 

Officials at DFC couldn't be reached to comment. 

Don Brash, governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, declined at a news conference Tuesday to answer questions about the size of DFC's loan provisions because, he said, the figures haven't been audited and they are confidential under the Reserve Bank's regulations. 

But he added: "Clearly, if the figure is substantiated it leaves them {DFC} with inadequate shareholders' funds to continue trading." 

Asked what impact DFC's situation would have on other New Zealand banks, Mr. Brash replied: "To the best of our knowledge there are no other institutions placed at risk by this action." 

Later, he added: "Most of DFC's creditors are, in fact, international banks rather than domestic banks so that we wouldn't expect the immediate domestic fallout to be very substantial."
