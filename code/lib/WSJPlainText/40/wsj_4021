American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said it will close its material-management services-repair operation in King of Prussia, Pa., as part of a national program to cut overhead and costs. 

AT&T said it plans to close facilities next year in Denver, Miami, Houston and California, affecting a total of 1,400 jobs. 

The move to close the King of Prussia operation within the next year will affect 660 of the 800 jobs at the facility.
AT&T said it will offer employees aid in moving, reassignment to other jobs in the company and for retraining for other careers.
The facility mainly repairs leased home phones, small-business telephone equipment and voice terminals for large business systems.
This work will be transferred to Atlanta and West Chicago, Ill. 

AT&T said it will establish a new location in eastern Pennsylvania to provide repair work and other services for the regional Bell operating companies.
