Kaman Corp. said it expects to report a third-quarter loss of 50 cents to 60 cents a share.
It had net income of 40 cents a share, or $7.1 million, in the year-earlier period. 

Actual third-quarter results will be reported in mid-October. 

The aerospace defense contractor attributed the expected loss report to a write-down of inventories in its industrial distribution business and pressures in defense markets, among other factors. 

The company said it expects per-share earnings for the fourth quarter to top the year-earlier 27 cents.
