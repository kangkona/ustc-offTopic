Regional Bancorp Inc., a bank holding company, said it rejected a $22.50-a-share, or $64 million, acquisition proposal by New York investors John S. Grace and Oliver R. Grace Jr., as "inadequate" and inconsistent with its strategy of long-term growth. 

As reported, the company had rejected an offer last March by the same investors to acquire Regional for $23 a share, or $58.3 million. 

The investors, who hold about a 9.9% stake in the company, made their offer Sept. 19, 1989. 

In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Regional closed Friday at $15 a share, down $1.
