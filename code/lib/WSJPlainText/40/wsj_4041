A federal grand jury in Dallas indicted 16 people associated with a racist "skinhead" group on charges of intimidating blacks, Hispanics and Jews, the Justice Department said. 

Seven of those indicted have already pleaded guilty to charges stemming from their involvement in racially and religiously motivated violence in the Dallas area last summer and fall, the department said.
The prosecutions are part of a continuing federal grand jury investigation of Dallas skinheads, who are part of a loosely organized national network of avowedly racist groups estimated to have about 3,000 members. 

The charges and guilty pleas in Dallas relate to conspiracies to commit acts of violence and actual threats against blacks and Hispanics, and acts of vandalism against the property of Jews, the Justice Department said.
