Cie.
Financiere de Paribas said it boosted its stake in Cie. de Navigation Mixte to 7% from about 2% in a "friendly move" toward the holding company. 

A Paribas official said he couldn't comment further on the increase, beyond saying that the decision follows similar steps by other shareholders of Navigation Mixte.
He added that Navigation Mixte's management was kept abreast of the share purchases by the French concern. 

Navigation Mixte has been at the center of speculation since last Wednesday, when its management requested and obtained a suspension of its stock and said an announcement would be made today.
The group also had its insurance units suspended, fueling speculation that it planned to ally these units with a big institution or group of institutions to help dissuade recent unwelcome interest in its stock. 

Officials of Navigation Mixte couldn't immediately be reached to comment on the decision by Paribas to boost its stake, or on details of today's announcement.
