France's new takeover code takes effect today, making it harder to acquire control of French companies on the cheap. 

The new code's main provision requires anyone who buys more than one-third of a company to bid for at least two-thirds of the shares.
That assures small holders that they will have a chance to sell at a fair price if control of a company changes.
The vague previous code generally required such a bid only when near-majority control was attained. 

The new code also makes clearer the concept of concerted action.
Under the new code, groups acting together are treated the same as individual acquirers.
That makes it difficult for an investor to "park" shares with allies to avoid hitting the 33.3% threshold. 

The new code also requires investors to bid for major listed subsidiaries of companies in which they acquire more than one-third of the shares.
This protects minority holders in the subsidiaries. 

The provisions apply only to future investments and don't affect investments made under the old code.
And they allow for exceptions -- for example, if an investor buys more than one-third of a company already majority-owned by someone else.
