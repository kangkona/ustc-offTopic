New York attorney Martin S. Ackerman and corporate raider Asher Edelman fired a volley of charges at each other as the bitter battle for Datapoint Corp. began officially. 

In a letter to shareholders accompanying his recently mailed consent solicitation, Mr. Ackerman, who is seeking to oust the board controlled by Mr. Edelman, said that since Mr. Edelman took control of the San Antonio, Texas, maker of computer products in 1985, shareholders' equity has fallen 35%, to $151 million from $232 million.
And while the company lost $126 million during that time, the letter says, Mr. Edelman, his associates and companies controlled by him have received more than $15 million in salaries and fees from Datapoint and Intelogic Trace Inc., which was spun off from Datapoint a few years ago. 

Mr. Edelman responded with his own letter to Datapoint shareholders, accusing Mr. Ackerman of trying to replace an elected board "with his own hand-picked nominees." In the letter, he said the company is still preparing information about the corporate bankruptcies with which Mr. Ackerman has been associated, as well as "other interesting data." It didn't provide further details. 

While Mr. Edelman and Mr. Ackerman vie for shareholder loyalties, what may be the deciding battle is being fought in a Delaware court, which must decide whether Mr. Edelman may vote the three million Datapoint shares he bought after Mr. Ackerman announced his consent solicitation.
Mr. Ackerman is challenging the purchase on several grounds, saying it was improper and made "solely to thwart the consent solicitation." 

A decision in favor of Mr. Edelman -- giving him control of 40% of Datapoint's shares -- could well doom Mr. Ackerman's takeover bid.
To gain control of Datapoint's board, Mr. Ackerman must obtain by Nov. 6 consents from holders of more than 50% of Datapoint's shares outstanding.
