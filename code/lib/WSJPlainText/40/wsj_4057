Comerica Inc. and Alliance Financial Corp. have agreed to a lower price for Comerica's purchase of Alliance. 

The new price is $48.28 a share, down 22 cents from the $48.50 a share specified in the purchase agreement announced last February.
The adjustment in the price reflects a higher cost of cleaning up hazardous materials on a parcel of property owned by Alliance's chief subsidiary. 

The new price would give the deal a value of about $53.1 million.
Alliance has about 1.1 million shares outstanding.
