President Jose Sarney's outgoing government is hoping to use persuasion to hold back inflation, which came to 36% last month, Brazil's second-highest rate ever. 

Persuasion is the only tactic left to Mr. Sarney, who has failed in four major campaigns to curb inflation since he took office in 1985. 

Finance Minister Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega will meet with industry leaders this week to ask them to cut profit margins and contain price rises.
Many businessmen, who fault the government for not cutting its own inflationary deficit spending, have raised prices as much as 50% a month. 

Mr. Nobrega pledged government efforts to restrain inflation with such steps as holding down increases for steel prices and utility rates, and maintaining high real, or inflation-adjusted, interest rates. 

Anticipating higher inflation this month, Brasilia last week raised the overnight interest rate on government bonds to the equivalent of a record 9,530% a year.
Economists say inflation could reach 40% or 50% in coming months.
The highest rate on record was a bit more than 70%, last January. 

Businessmen and economists have again begun to suggest a new wage-price freeze, although Mr. Nobrega is ruling this out.
Mr. Sarney's successor is to be elected in a two-round election in November and December and takes office in March.
