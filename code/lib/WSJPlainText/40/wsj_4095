Two large Australian banks confirmed they purchased stakes in one another's stock but denied that merger talks are under way. 

National Australia Bank Ltd. said it acquired "several parcels" of shares in rival Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., and ANZ Bank said it acquired "one package" of shares in National Australia Bank. 

Trading in the two Melbourne-based banks' shares surged on the Australian Stock Exchange last week on merger rumors. 

Adelaide Steamship Co., an investment company that owned an estimated 10% of ANZ, 15% of National Australia Bank and 8% of Westpac Banking Corp., recently sold some of its holdings. 

Some analysts said those sales might have sparked the cross-buying by ANZ and National Australia Bank.
Some analysts say they expect ANZ and National Australia Bank eventually to merge.
There also is speculation that Sydney-based Westpac could merge with government-owned Commonwealth Banking Corp. if the government decides to sell it. 

ANZ, National Australia Bank, Westpac and Commonwealth Bank are the four dominant banks in Australia.
