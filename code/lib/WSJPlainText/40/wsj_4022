Deere & Co. said it reached an agreement to settle an age-discrimination lawsuit filed by 139 former employees who were fired as part of a 1984 work-force reduction. 

The farm-equipment maker, which didn't disclose the financial terms of the settlement, said the agreement provides the former workers with enhanced pension benefits and cash payments. 

Deere initiated the reductions, and other measures, in the early 1980s to reduce cost and improve efficiencies.
The company has consistently disputed that age discrimination was involved in the reductions, but said it agreed to the settlement to avoid the expense of lengthy litigation and the drain on management time. 

According to lawyers for the plaintiffs, the settlement "compares favorably" with an accord negotiated earlier this year between Deere and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for another group of former employees who were also fired under the reductions. 

In that settlement, Deere agreed to pay $4.3 million, which consisted of $1.3 million for enhanced pension benefits, to credit the employees with additional years of service, and cash payments of $3 million.
