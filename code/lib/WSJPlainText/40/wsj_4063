A group led by former Treasury Secretary William E. Simon said it plans to raise about $100 million in public financing to bring HonFed Bank into compliance with minimum capital requirements set by the recent federal thrift bailout legislation. 

Mr. Simon declined to elaborate on the fund-raising plans except to say that the funds would be used to replace about $80 million in goodwill carried on the books of the Honolulu-based thrift.
Goodwill is an accounting device allowing a thrift to use intangible or non-earning assets to shore up its asset base. 

Mr. Simon and his group acquired HonFed in late 1986 after it slipped into insolvency.
After taking write-downs on bad loans and certain real estate assets, the group was allowed to create about $100 million in goodwill in order to meet regulatory capital requirements at the time.
However, Congress, in its recent thrift bailout legislation, has ordered thrifts to phase out the use of goodwill in meeting new capital requirements. 

HonFed has since paid down its goodwill assets to $80 million, using cash from earnings.
Mr. Simon said that while HonFed technically has five years to replace the remainder of its goodwill, the group decided to move more quickly, because "we wanted Honfed to be a sound institution beyond any question." The thrift, as of June 30, had assets of $3.05 billion.
