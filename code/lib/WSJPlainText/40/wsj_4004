(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

WALL STREET NEARLY SELF-DESTROYED in a convulsion of stock trading in 1968 because of its long neglect of low-paid, overworked back-room clerks. 

April 10 that year -- 10 days after President Johnson said he wouldn't run again -- was the first 20 million-plus share trading day in history.
More frenzied days ensued as dapper front-office salesmen counted their commissions, and clerks, often unskilled or inept, in back "cages" were swamped in piles of paper.
New stabs at automation had snafus. 

"Fails," delivery of securities later than the required five days of the transaction, were common and growing.
Certificates were mislaid, lost and stolen.
A later Rand study reported from 25% to 40% of broker certificate deliveries to banks in 1968 were rejected with the cause notation of "D.K." for "don't know," meaning the identity of the buyer or seller was unknown. 

Timidly, from Jan. 22 to March 4, the exchanges tried to solve the problem by cutting daily trading hours.
But "fails" still rose; so the markets, effective June 12, closed every Wednesday to give the backrooms some catchup time. 

Brokers at the same time were fueling the national stock hunger with ads, hiring more salesmen and opening new offices.
Robert W. Haack, the Big Board's new president, in two soft letters warned them to cool it.
The SEC even threatened fraud action against brokers accepting more orders than they could handle. 

"Fails" reached a record $4.1 billion in December.
But the market finally cooled, and Wednesday closings ended Jan. 2, 1969.
Normal trading hours were resumed May 4, 1970, as the market headed into its plunge and about 100 brokers were out of business. 

Today, despite far heavier trading, back-office booboos are fewer because of the use of computers and "book entries" in lieu of certificates.
