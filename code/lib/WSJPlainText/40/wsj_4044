Boeing Co. said the tail section of an E-6A jetplane, being readied for the Navy, came apart during a test flight. 

It was the second such incident this year. "A fluke is one thing, but when it happens a second time, obviously we're concerned," said a spokesman for the Seattle aircraft maker.
He said investigators were searching for a cause. 

The E-6A -- several of which already have been delivered to the Navy -- uses a trailing antenna to serve as a communications link between command authorities and the nation's Trident submarine fleet.
It is a derivative of the 707 airliner. 

The latest accident, like the one in February, occurred during a "flutter test" in which the pilots apply abrupt changes to the flight-control system.
The plane landed safely at Boeing Field here, with about a quarter of its tail missing.
