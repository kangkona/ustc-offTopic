A federal judge is giving the Chicago Board of Trade a second chance to decide whether to discipline futures trader Lawrence Malato. 

In 1984, the board found Mr. Malato and two other Treasury bond-futures traders guilty of breaking exchange rules against pre-arranged trading, among other things.
Mr. Malato's punishment was the harshest: He was fined $50,000 and suspended from the exchange for seven years. 

Arguing that his punishment was too severe, Mr. Malato appealed the action to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
In May, the agency ordered the Board of Trade to return the fine to Mr. Malato with accrued interest and to end his suspension. 

The Board of Trade said a federal judge here ruled that it had acted properly in punishing Mr. Malato, and that the judge ordered the CFTC to allow exchange officials to reconsider Mr. Malato's case.
A Board of Trade spokesman said the exchange will decide shortly whether to reinstate its early punishment, or take some other action. 

Mr. Malato couldn't be reached for comment. 

In Washington, a CFTC spokesman Friday said the agency won't comment until it finishes reviewing the ruling.
