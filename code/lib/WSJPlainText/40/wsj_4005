(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

CORTES WESLEY RANDELL, a 32-year old promoter, on April 25, 1968, founded National Student Marketing Corp., which briefly became a hot stock before it flunked out.
Major lawyers, accountants, investment houses and college endowment funds flunked along with it. 

NSM based its glamour on an on-campus sales force that sold a range of things from posters to class rings to pillows for counterculture sit-ins.
Randell used NSM's soaring stock to buy 25 companies in 12 months.
He also bought a $600,000 house, a 55-foot yacht and a private jet. 

But NSM wasn't really doing that well.
Its earnings in the year ended Aug. 31, 1969, were inflated by including acquisitions before they were acquired.
On Nov. 5, 1969, Randell predicted a near triple gain for fiscal 1970 earnings; NSM stock leaped by $7.
Company insiders unloaded shares. 

It all caved in on Feb. 16, 1970, when NSM said it expected a first-quarter loss.
Randell resigned three days later.
And 18 embarrassed investment houses watched their clientslose $100 million. 

Responding to a Securities and Exchange Commission complaint, a federal judge on July 27, 1972, enjoined NSM from any further violations of antifraud and reporting laws.
NSM consented to this without admitting or denying SEC charges. 

Randell pleaded guilty to stock fraud and in December 1974 drew an 18-month prison sentence and $40,000 fine.
Other NSM officers and a former Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. partner (NSM's auditors) also received prison sentences. 

The case became controversial when the SEC charged that two law firms should have blown the whistle.
White & Case and Lord, Bissell & Brook denied all wrongdoing.
But in 1977 White & Case settled with the SEC; and the SEC conditionally dropped its action against Lord Bissell in 1980.
NSM was liquidated in 1981.
