An Ontario judge ruled that Michael Blair, president of Enfield Corp., improperly declared himself elected as a director at the company's annual meeting.
The judge appointed the nominee of Enfield's largest shareholder to the board in Mr. Blair's place. 

Ontario Supreme Court Justice John Holland said Mr. Blair "chose to act as judge in his own cause" when he disallowed ballots cast by representatives of Canadian Express Ltd. at the June 20 meeting.
Mr. Holland said Mr. Blair's actions at the meeting were "in accord with a plan conceived . . . to protect his personal interests." 

Canadian Express, which has a 38.5% stake in Enfield, nominated Timothy Price, chairman of Hees International Bancorp Ltd., as a director and cast the votes it held in his favor.
Mr. Blair, ruling that proxies held by Canadian Express officials were void, declared himself elected. 

Canadian Express, a holding company, is a subsidiary of Hees, another holding company controlled by Toronto financiers Peter and Edward Bronfman with investments in consumer products, resources and financial services.
Enfield is a manufacturing concern. 

Mr. Blair has been under a restraining order preventing him from acting as a director since shortly after the annual meeting.
Enfield's board is preparing a management circular for a second shareholders' meeting called for Oct. 31 to elect new directors. 

Manfred Walt, president of Canadian Express, said the Enfield board may or may not nominate Mr. Blair as a director.
He added that Canadian Express will probably issue its own circular, which won't nominate Mr. Blair. 

Mr. Blair said he is "disappointed but not surprised" by the court ruling.
He had argued that the ballots weren't in accord with the proxies held by Canadian Express, making them invalid.
