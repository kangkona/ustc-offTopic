(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT'S BRAINTRUSTERS talked about health insurance for the elderly as far back as 1935, when Social Security was taking shape.
It would take 30 years and four presidents before anything happened.
Bills were introduced regularly to the Congresses of the '40s and '50s.
All failed.
Not until Lyndon Johnson overwhelmed Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election and brought a fresh array of Democrats into Congress was action finally taken. 

Harry Truman opened a 15-year battle in 1950 with his proposals for medical insurance for the elderly.
Point man was his health administrator, Oscar Ewing (to the horror of partners at his old Wall Street law firm).
Arrayed against Truman and Ewing was the might of organized medicine, physicians, hospitals and insurance companies. 

Seniors did get some help, but it was primarily as proverty relief.
John F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey, while senators, sponsored such legislation.
The Kerr-Mills Act of 1960 (named for Oklahoma Sen. Robert Kerr and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Wilbur Mills) added new federal money for medical care, but it was still relief.
The Kennedy administration tried -- and failed -- for three years to change things.
By this time, the program had a new name, Medicare, borrowed from a Pentagon plan for the armed forces. 

After his election sweep, LBJ made medical insurance for the elderly his first priority.
The new Congress had a new attitude, and stalwarts like Mills sensed that members wanted a medical bill.
Even old opponents of hospital insurance pushed old-age health care.
Medicare became law, for those above and below the poverty line.
For the signing ceremony, President Johnson went to Independence, Mo., to let Harry Truman, then 81, witness the end of the fight he had begun 15 years before.
