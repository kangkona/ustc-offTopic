International Semi-Tech Microelectronics Inc. said in Toronto that it plans to raise 200 million Canadian dollars (US$170 million) by selling some of the assets of Ssmc Inc., which it acquired last April. 

The company said that it plans to dispose of seven or eight Ssmc business units but didn't identify which ones.
It said it has either closed the sale or reached agreements regarding the divestiture of C$92 million of assets. 

Company executives couldn't be reached for additional details. 

The company said the proceeds of the sales would be used to reduce debt incurred to finance the Ssmc acquisition.
