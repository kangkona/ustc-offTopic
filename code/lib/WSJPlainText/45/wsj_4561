Yields on certificates of deposit edged up this week, following increases in Treasury bill yields at Monday's auction. 

The average yield offered by major banks on a six-month CD of less than $50,000 rose to 8.04% in the week ended yesterday from 8.01%, according to Banxquote Money Markets.
The New York information service reported that a one-year CD of less than $50,000 had an average yield of 8.03%, compared with 8% last week.
Those maturities are the most popular among individual investors. 

"The weaker dollar put pressure on Treasury bill rates, which in turn affected the rest of the market," said Norberto Mehl, chairman of Banxquote. 

The six-month Treasury bill sold at Monday's auction yielded 8.22%, up from 8.06% a week earlier.
Bankers typically set CD rates on Tuesday or Wednesday, following trends at the T-bill auction. 

CDs sold by major brokerage firms, which tend to reflect auction results more closely, rose a bit more than those at banks.
The average yield on a broker-sold six-month CD rose to 8.43% from 8.30%.
On a one-year CD it rose a quarter of a percentage point to 8.50%. 

Yields on large-denomination CDs, generally more than $90,000, also rose a fraction of a percentage point.
The average yield this week was 8.23% for six months, up from 8.17%, and 8.22% for a year, up from 8.13%. 

CD yields have stayed within a narrow range for more than a month -- in the neighborhood of 8% in smaller denominations and slightly higher for large deposits.
Yields are nearly the same in all maturities, a condition known as a flat yield curve. 

Yields "have been moving up slightly, then stabilizing and then going down," said Mr. Mehl. "It's hard to make long-term predictions right now."
