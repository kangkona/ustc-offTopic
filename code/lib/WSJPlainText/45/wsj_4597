Color Systems Technology Inc. said that General Electric Pension Trust seized its 85-title film library and other collateral after Color Systems defaulted on a loan with the General Electric Co. trust. 

General Electric Pension Trust credited the company nearly $3.8 million after taking control of the library, reducing Color Systems remaining debt to GE to $12.6 million.
Color Systems, which converts black-and-white film to color videotape, said it is working with GE Pension Trust to restructure the debt. 

In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Color Systems shares rose 12.5 cents to close at $2. 

Color Systems first disclosed in March that it had missed the debt payments and that it might "seek relief from creditors" to complete a reorganization.
But Buddy Young, the company's president and chief executive officer, yesterday said Color Systems doesn't anticipate filing for bankruptcy-law protection.
The company's total debt stands at about $17 million, he said. 

Mr. Young said Color Systems will have a net loss for the fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30 after taking a $4 million nonrecurring write-down from the loss of the library, which includes the film "Room at the Top," and the Abbott & Costello television series.
But on an operating basis, Mr. Young said, the company will post the largest profit in its history.
