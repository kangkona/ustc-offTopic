(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

BERNARD CORNFELD, THE SHOWY FOUNDER of "go-go" offshore mutual funds, was riding high when a U.S. agency asked him for records on Nov. 29, 1965. 

Cornfeld, a former social worker, founded Investors Overseas Services, a Geneva-based, Panama-incorporated fund manager, in 1960 to sell funds outside the U.S.
He didn't comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's request, claiming it would violate Swiss privacy laws.
So, the SEC on Feb. 7, 1966, began an inquiry, charging IOS with the illegal sale of unregistered securities.
IOS called the charges "outrageous." 

By then IOS had branches in 78 countries and Fund of Funds, its largest, was a world leader.
Cornfeld, worth $150 million, owned a town house built by Napoleon, an 11th century castle, horses and more. 

His formula was simple: set up subsidiary fund-selling firms around the world and deploy people to sell funds that, in turn, invested in U.S. mutual funds.
Cornfeld asked salesmen prospects: "Do you sincerely want to be rich?" Buyers didn't realize they, in effect, paid commissions twice: to the IOS fund and to the U.S. funds in the IOS portfolio. 

Despite a May 1967 order barring IOS companies from operating in the U.S., it kept growing abroad -- and Cornfeld had his own jet.
By the end of 1969 IOS had a million customers in 100 countries and $2.5 billion of managed assets.
In 1970, as the U.S. stock market plunged, IOS stock sank to $2 from the $20s in late 1969.
Law cases sprang from the debris. 

IOS directors forced chairman Cornfeld out on May 8, 1970; in 1973 the Swiss jailed him for nearly a year on fraud charges, but ajury acquitted him in 1979.
Currently, he's living a cheerful life as a European real estate developer.
Robert Vesco, who had become IOS chairman in 1971, fled the U.S. in early 1973 after being charged with looting $224 million in IOS funds and with making illegal political contributions.
