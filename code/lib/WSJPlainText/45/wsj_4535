Ferruzzi Agricola Finanziaria S.p.
A., the main holding company of Italy's giant agro-industrial Feruzzi Group, reported consolidated net profit rose 89% to 294 billion lire ($215.1 million) in the first half from 156 billion lire a year earlier. 

Net sales as of June 30 more than doubled to 7.707 trillion lire from 3.508 trillion lire a year earlier. 

The company predicted consolidated operating results should finish the year "in line" with 1988's performance. 

The consolidated results reflect the entire earnings of chemical company Montedison, which weren't included in their entirety last year.
The results also reflect partial results from the recently founded state-private chemical venture Enimont under the equity method. 

Parent company net profits rose 60% to 32 billion lire in the first half from 20 billion lire a year earlier. 

Ferruzzi Agricola is 58%-owned by Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.
A., the key holding company of Italy's second-largest private-sector industrial group after Fiat.
