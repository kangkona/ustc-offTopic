(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

LOUIS ELWOOD WOLFSON, an early corporate raider, had his ups and downs Nov. 28, 1967, was a real downer. 

On that day he was sentenced to a year in prison and fined $100,000 for selling unregistered stock in Continental Enterprises, a small Florida real estate company he controlled.
And on Dec. 8, 1968, he was hit by an added 18 months of prison plus a $32,000 fine on conviction of conspiring to obstruct a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into the 1962-1964 stock buy-backs at Merritt-Chapman & Scott, which he was liquidating. 

He took over Merritt in 1951 and built it into an early conglomerate of financing to shipbuilding concerns before it ran into debt problems. 

At the first sentencing he said, "I certainly didn't intend to do anything wrong." At the second, he blamed his advisors, claimed he was a victim of government "bias" and denied he had willfully broken the law. 

Wolfson had an earlier brush with the SEC, which was signaling a new get-tough stance, on Aug. 1, 1958, when he consented, without admitting wrongdoing, to an SEC injunction against his making "false or misleading" statements that he still held American Motors stock when he had sold it. 

His first rise to prominence was a heated 1955 unsuccessful proxy fight that sought control of Montgomery Ward from 81-year old Sewell Avery, who had headed the big retailer since 1931.
Avery said Wolfson had a "very hungry eye" for Ward's cash, and retired shortly after his victory. 

Early this year the Supreme Court refused to hear Wolfson's second appeal to clear his name.
In 1969, Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas resigned after disclosure that he had accepted $20,000 from a Wolfson family foundation. 

Wolfson's major ups have come from horse racing.
His Affirmed won the Triple Crown in 1978.
