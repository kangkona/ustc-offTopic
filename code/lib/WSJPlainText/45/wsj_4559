.START 

Your Sept. 1 advertising column on Manhattan, inc. missed the point of its stagnation.
Too bad you didn't ask a few readers. 

When this magazine started, it was the best.
It was a delight to read, full of exciting, interesting articles, wit, humor, fancy, verve and originality.
It reflected the vitality and dynamism that we like to think that New York has.
The editor then was a woman who was subsequently fired. 

Then the publication became stodgy, full of PR, press-release puffery, given to adoring adulation of the richissimos.
Its articles were often stupid, silly and boring.
I am sure that I am not alone in wondering at the management that destroyed a talented staff.
