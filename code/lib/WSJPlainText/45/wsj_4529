Mountaineer Bankshares of West Virginia Inc. said that a larger-than-expected loan-loss provision for the third quarter will result in a substantial reduction in net income and that an additional loan-loss provision will hurt fourth-quarter net. 

The company earned $1.2 million in each of the year-earlier quarters.
Mountaineer expects profit for 1989 to decline 30% from the $4.6 million it earned last year. 

The bank said the additional loan-loss provisions were caused by bad car loans at a subsidiary, Old Nationwide Bank, in Martinsburg, W.Va., where Mountaineer is based. 

Mountaineer also announced a restructuring program.
The company said it is merging Morgan County State Bank with Old Nationwide Bank, and it is eliminating $1.5 million in overhead expense.
Staff levels will be reduced by 400 people, or about 8% of the work force.
