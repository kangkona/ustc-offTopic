Rep. Roy Dyson (D., Md.) is returning $18,000 in campaign donations, gathered for him in 1987 by executives of Unisys Corp., because of suspicion they were illegal. 

The congressman, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, returned another $1,000 Unisys gift earlier this year after the donor admitted as part of a guilty plea that the Pentagon contractor had reimbursed him for the gift from corporate funds in violation of federal law. 

Rep. Dyson said some of the contributors of the $18,000, all connected to Unisys, have pleaded guilty to making illegal donations to other congressional campaigns. "We are not alleging that the contributions were made illegally," he said. "I am making a personal decision, however, that the funds be returned out of an abundance of caution." 

Rep. Dyson, who announced he is running for re-election, also said a former administrative aide improperly diverted $7,275 in campaign funds for the aide's personal use.
The congressman said he expects his campaign committee will pay a fine to the Federal Election Commission as a result.
The aide committed suicide last year.
