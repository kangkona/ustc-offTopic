MCI Communications Corp. said it is testing a service that provides multilocation customers with a summary of important management information collected in MCI's billing process. 

The service, MCI Portfolio, was announced at the Telecommunications Association conference in San Diego.
The service is being used at Merrill Lynch & Co., one of MCI's largest customers, and will be tested at about 20 companies before the end of the year.
A full roll-out is planned for the first quarter of next year, the Washington-based long-distance telephone company said. 

Kevin Sharer, an MCI executive vice president, said the new service eliminates the labor-intensive task of culling management information from pages and pages of telephone bills and immediately gives a telecom manager a picture of how the communications dollar is being spent. 

The market for the service, which is expected to become an important tool for selling MCI service to large customers, is the 15,000 to 20,000 companies that have five or more locations.
Together, those companies spend an estimated $12 billion annually on telecommunications services, an MCI spokeswoman said.
