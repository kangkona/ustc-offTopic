I beg to differ with Ray Stahl's assertion in his Sept. 18 letter to the editor: "The poor do not read the {Wall Street} Journal." 

I've been reading your venerable paper faithfully for well over 30 years, and no doubt its many revelations of the repulsive machinations of the rich and famous have contributed mightily to my remaining basically honest and hopelessly poor.
