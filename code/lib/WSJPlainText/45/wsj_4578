One of the more remarkable phenomena of our time is the degree of public hysteria that has been whipped up over "cancer-causing" factors in the environment -- from apple chemicals to nuclear-power plants.
Scientists are in fact developing a deeper knowledge of why and how tumors develop in humans.
This week, for instance, researchers from the National Cancer Institute announced they have identified defects in some genes that can put some people at high risk of developing lung cancer.
A similar genetic abnormality has been found to play a role in several other forms of cancer.
What these findings suggest is that cancer may be more a factor of one's genetic inheritance and that there is less reason to credit the many "cancer phobias" that receive so much publicity.
