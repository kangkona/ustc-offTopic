IN THE PREDAWN ON SEPT. 25, 1967, the Cunard Line's Queen Mary, outbound from New York, passed her sister ship the Queen Elizabeth heading west.
The floodlighted ships exchanged salutes.
For the Mary, it was farewell.
Another great trans-Atlantic liner was headed for oblivion. 

The midocean salute was one more sign of the inevitable.
In 1958, the year the first jetliner took off from Europe, airplanes had carried more trans-Atlantic passengers than ships.
By 1965, when 4.3 million people crossed the Atlantic, only 714,000, or 17%, went by sea. 

The Mary would end up as a floating hotel in California's Long Beach harbor.
The Elizabeth would die a fiery hulk in Hong Kong on her way to a scrap yard.
Even without the 80,000-ton Queens, however, the liner lived on.
Cunard launched the 67,000-ton Queen Elizabeth II in 1969 and she still makes scheduled trans-Atlantic runs. (Currently, the QE II is on lease in Osaka, Japan, as a hotel and shopping mall.) 

The pleasure cruise saved the big ships.
Cunard had tried a prototype in 1948, the Caronia, designed to sail any ocean with such features as a permanent outdoor swimming pool.
Today the Cruise Line International Association counts 191 ships (105 operating in North America), with 122,000 berths, an average of almost 650 per ship.
The new flagships are approaching the old Queens in size.
Royal Caribbean's Sovereign of the Seas displaces 74,000 tons and even bigger cruise ships are coming. 

The American flag, however, flies on only two lines (one for river steamers).
The U.S. let its passenger ships go by default.
In 1965, LBJ's maritime commissioner called U.S. liners "the only subsidized luxury in American industry." The world's biggest operator, Carnival, is on the American Stock Exchange but its seven ships fly foreign flags. 

The cruise operators see only clear sailing ahead.
Last year, almost 3.2 million Americans boarded cruise ships -- barely 2% of the U.S. population.
