Campeau Corp. pledged its U.S. retail and real estate holdings and some major Canadian properties as collateral for a $250 million loan from Olympia & York Developments Ltd., according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing by O&Y. 

In the filing, O&Y, an investment holding concern closely held by Toronto's Reichmann family, also said it is prepared to lend Campeau as much as $220 million of $800 million in bridge financing that it agreed to use its "best reasonable efforts" to arrange for Campeau. 

O&Y filed a Schedule 13D document with the SEC regarding its $250 million loan to Campeau.
As previously reported, the loan provides Campeau's cash-squeezed retailing units, Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., with short-term working capital.
Under terms of the loan, O&Y's fully diluted stake in Campeau increased to 38.4% from 25% while Campeau Chairman Robert Campeau's fully diluted interest fell to 43.2% from 54%. 

O&Y said in the filing that it obtained collateral security on Campeau's wholly owned Campeau Corp. (U.S.) Inc., its 83.8% indirect interest in Ralphs Grocery Co. and some of Campeau's prime Canadian properties.
Campeau (U.S.) owns all of Campeau's U.S. properties unit, 100% of Allied and 92.5% of Federated.
The Canadian assets held as security under the O&Y loan include Campeau's two main Toronto office towers -- 50%-owned Scotia Plaza and 100%-owned Water -- Park Place, a London, Ontario, shopping center, and other Toronto properties. 

O&Y said that in each case, the collateral security is subject to prior claims and charges. 

In the SEC filing, O&Y said Mr. Campeau asked O&Y to increase its investment in Campeau and help the company maintain "orderly operations" while pursuing a financial restructuring to reduce its debt.
O&Y said it will select a chief executive officer and chief financial officer for Campeau (U.S.) who will report directly to a four-member committee of Campeau directors in charge of the restructuring. 

According to the filing, O&Y agreed to modify the terms of other Campeau debt it holds.
The maturity date of O&Y's $75 million loan to Campeau, made last April during a refinancing of Allied, has been pushed back to Sept. 12, 1991, from March 31, 1990.
Also, the terms of $260 million of Campeau debentures previously purchased by O&Y were amended to subordinate them to Campeau debt held by Edward J. DeBartolo Corp., of Youngstown, Ohio.
DeBartolo lent Campeau $480 million during its takeover of Federated last year. 

O&Y said its $250 million loan to Campeau bears interest at 9.875% annually and matures Sept. 15, 1991.
The $800 million bridge loan is expected to have a term of as long as 3 1/2 years, and is conditional on the sale of Campeau's Bloomingdale's department store chain and the repurchase of 75% of Federated's and Allied's public debt at Sept. 15, 1989 market prices.
