Chile plans to buy as much as $550 million of its $6.3 billion in commercial bank debt outstanding, repeating a similar operation in October when it redeemed $299 million for an outlay of $168.4 million. 

Chile's central bank will call for bids next month from creditor banks, then take up those giving the best discount, officials said.
Chilean debt is currently trading at 62% or 63% of face value, compared with last October's 56%.
The purchase will be financed by a $1 billion fund of surplus copper export earnings built up during the past two years.
