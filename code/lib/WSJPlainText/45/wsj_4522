A group led by Haas & Partners Inc. said it offered to acquire Commercial Intertech Corp. for $27.50 a share, or $355 million. 

Despite the significant premium over market value offered in the bid, Commercial Intertech said its board unanimously rejected it. "The board is committed to enhancing shareholder value and believes that can best be achieved by pursuing the company's long-range strategic growth plan under existing management," the company said in a release.
In over-the-counter trading Wednesday, Commercial Intertech closed at $19 a share, down 37.5 cents. 

The rejection clouded Haas's hopes for a friendly transaction.
In a prepared statement, Robert B. Haas, chairman, said, "We have never engaged in a hostile acquisition . . . nor have we ever engaged in a 'break-up' transaction." 

The offer is the largest acquisition bid in which Haas & Partners has been involved.
The private investment firm formed after the recent break-up of Hicks & Haas Inc., the leveraged-buy-out firm that became a major player in the soft-drink industry.
In its first transaction earlier this month, Haas & Partners agreed to buy Jackson Products Inc., a unit of Radnor Pa.-based Airgas Inc., for $70 million in cash and debt. 

Mr. Haas has previously said that his company intends to acquire publicly held and closely held companies with niches in manufacturing, commercial and industrial areas.
Commercial Intertech, a Youngstown, Ohio, maker of hydraulic components, fluid purification devices and metal products, employs about 4,000 people in 30 facilities around the world.
In 1988, the company reported net income of $16.6 million on revenue of $398.6 million. 

The offer for Commercial Intertech came from Buckeye Acquisition Co., a corporation formed by Haas & Partners and Kenneth F. Yontz, the chairman, president and chief executive officer of Milwaukee-based Sybron Corp., a maker and marketer of laboratory and dental products.
