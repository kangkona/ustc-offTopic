Some traders were encouraged by the market's reaction to the two announcements.

"If it was going to go down big time, today was the day." 

Len Hefter of Jefferies & Co. 's OTC desk in Dallas observed, "Sellers don't seem to have the clout that they have had in the past to knock the market down and keep it down.
Buyers creep back in at the end." But he said there might be a delayed negative reaction today from some investors to yesterday's news.
