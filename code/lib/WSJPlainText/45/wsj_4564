General Motors Corp. 's Pontiac division said it plans to boost its total vehicle sales by about 6% in the 1990 model year, mainly because of sales of a new plastic-bodied minivan. 

But Pontiac officials also conceded that they expect sales of their primary midsized car line, the Pontiac Grand Prix, won't be enough to assure that the GM plant exclusively dedicated to the model will work at full capacity in the 1990 model year. 

Pontiac's modest expectations for the Grand Prix, one of four lines GM designed as part of its $5 billion GM-10 midsized car program, is another sign that despite the recent announcement that the company will indefinitely idle a plant in Lakewood, Ga., GM has a long way to go to solve its costly overcapacity problem. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, GM rose to $48.25, up $1.125. 

Pontiac officials said during a new model preview yesterday that they expect total Grand Prix sales will be about 175,000 vehicles in the 1990 model year.
Of that total, about 70,000 should be new sedan models, division general sales and service manager E. M. Schlesinger said.
Sales of the two-year-old Grand Prix coupe, however, will fall to 105,000 vehicles in 1990 from about 118,000 cars in the 1989 model year that ends Sept. 30, Pontiac officials predicted. 

But the modern Fairfax, Kan., plant that builds the Grand Prix line is capable of producing more than 250,000 cars a year.
GM's Oldsmobile division also has predicted that 1990 sales of its GM-10 car, the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, won't be enough to utilize the full capacity of the Doraville, Ga., plant dedicated to that car. 

Overall, Pontiac projected it would sell about 780,000 vehicles, up from 735,000 in the 1989 model year.
But most of that increase is expected to come from sales of the new Trans Sport minivan, which actually will be classified as a truck for safety and environmental purposes, Pontiac officials said.
Trans Sport sales could amount to between 40,000 and 60,000 vehicles, depending on production at the Tarrytown, N.Y., factory that assembles the vans.
Pontiac is sharing the plant's output with GM's Chevrolet and Oldsmobile divisions. 

Pontiac officials said they expect the division's passenger car sales will rise slightly to about 745,000 vehicles, and that Pontiac's share of the U.S. car market will increase to 7.5% in the 1990 model year, up from 7.2% in the current model year.
