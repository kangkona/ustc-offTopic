SEEQ Technology Inc., San Jose, Calif., said a "precipitous decline in orders" for some semiconductor products resulted in a loss for the fiscal fourth quarter, ended Sunday.
It declined to estimate the loss. 

It was the second consecutive quarter of bad news for SEEQ, which previously reported that profit slumped 31% in its fiscal third quarter.
At the time, the semiconductor maker blamed increased marketing and research expenses. 

In national over-the-counter trading, SEEQ closed at $4.125, up 6.25 cents. 

SEEQ said most fourth-quarter problems stem from slumping sales of its Ethernet chip sets, arrays of semiconductors that help large networks of computers to communicate.
However, a SEEQ spokesman characterized the downturn in those orders as a "short-term phenomenon," saying September bookings improved sharply over orders for July and August. 

For the year-earlier quarter, SEEQ posted net income of $2.3 million, or 18 cents a share.
