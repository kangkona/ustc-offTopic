SmithKline Beecham PLC said it discontinued clinical trials of the oral form of Corlopam for congestive heart failure. 

The London-based pharmaceutical company said that form of the drug, known generically as fenoldopam, was found not to provide significant benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Previously, the company had said that the oral form was the one with the largest market potential. 

SmithKline added, however, that it is continuing studies of the oral form in the treatment of chronic renal failure.
And the company has already asked the Food and Drug Administration for marketing approval of an intravenous form in acute hypertension.
