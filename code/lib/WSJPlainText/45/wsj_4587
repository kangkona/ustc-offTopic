"Chicken Soup," an ABC situation comedy touted as a sure hit for the fall season, is off to a sluggish start. 

The show, starring comedian Jackie Mason, last week lost 26% of the viewers in the audience for "Roseanne," the successful show that precedes it, according to figures released by A.C. Nielsen Co. 

Executives at other networks used the figures to needle their rival.
NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff said viewers had "rejected" the show.
And David F. Poltrack, senior vice president of planning and research at the CBS Broadcast Group, a division of CBS Inc., called the figures "a sign of dissatisfaction." 

"Chicken Soup" was No. 14 for the first week of the 1989-90 TV season, with an 18.4 rating and 29 share, compared with "Roseanne," which was No. 2 with a 24.7 rating and 38 share, behind "The Cosby Show" on NBC, which is a unit of General Electric Co. "Chicken Soup" premiered the week before, getting a 21.8 rating and a 34 share against repeats on the other networks. 

ABC, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., said it was satisfied with the performance of "Chicken Soup." "It's only the first week," said Alan Wurtzel, senior vice president of marketing and research services. "I'm happy with a 29 share and I'm sure my colleagues at the other networks would be as well." A ratings point equals 904,000 TV households; shares are the percentage of sets in use.
