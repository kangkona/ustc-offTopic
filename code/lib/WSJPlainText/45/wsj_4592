Santa Anita Realty Enterprises said Royce B. McKinley, its 68-year-old chief executive officer, was elected chairman, succeeding Robert P. Strub, 71, who was named to the new positions of vice chairman and chairman of the executive committee. 

The election was one of a number of management changes at the real estate investment trust and Santa Anita Operating Co., which operates the Santa Anita racetrack near Los Angeles.
The racetrack, in turn, is owned by Santa Anita Realty.
The two companies are paired for trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

Mr. McKinley was succeeded as president of Santa Anita Realty by Glenn L. Carpenter, who also was named chief operating officer.
Mr. Carpenter, 46, was previously executive vice president, secretary and treasurer.
Donald G. Herrman, 32, controller, was named to the additional position of treasurer. 

Santa Anita Operating elected Mr. Strub to the new post of chairman of the executive committee.
He remains as chairman, president and chief executive of the operating company. 

Also at the operating company, Clifford C. Goodrich, 46, was named to the new post of vice president.
Mr. Goodrich, who was executive vice president of Los Angeles Turf Club Inc., a unit of Santa Anita Operating, was also elected president and chief operating officer of the unit. 

Messrs.
Goodrich and Carpenter were elected to the boards of both Santa Anita Realty and Santa Anita Operating, as was Thomas P. Mullaney, 56, a general partner of Kidd, Kamm & Co., a private investment company. 

Linda K. Mennis, 37 and Mr. Strub's niece, was elected a director of Santa Anita Operating.
