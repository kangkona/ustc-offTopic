The Arizona Department of Insurance determined Sir James Goldsmith's hostile #13.35 billion ($21.14 billion) takeover bid for B.A.T Industries PLC isn't exempt from review by the Arizona regulators. 

Sir James's Hoylake Investments Ltd. had been seeking an exemption from the regulatory review in Arizona and eight other states where B.A.T's Farmers Group Inc. insurance unit has operations.
Hoylake has also filed federal lawsuits in the nine states seeking to block the reviews. 

Hoylake has claimed B.A.T is "primarily engaged in business other than the business of insurance," and that a review by the state insurance regulators, therefore, is uncalled for. 

Hoylake's attorneys said yesterday that while they believe the Arizona insurance regulators lack the legal authority to review the bid, they are confident that the offer will ultimately be approved by the regulators. 

The blow to Hoylake comes one day after B.A.T proposed a restructuring to thwart the unwanted takeover attempts.
