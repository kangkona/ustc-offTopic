A rail-car joint venture of two Japanese companies was named as the apparent low bidder for a $170 million contract to supply 132 new subway cars to Taipei, Taiwan. 

United Rail Car Manufacturing Co., a partnership between Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. and a unit of Nissho Iwai Corp., would be required to construct the trains using at least 50% U.S. parts if it wins the contract.
The venture, which has a manufacturing plant here, supplied subway cars for the New York City and New Jersey PATH mass-transit systems. 

The cars are to be delivered by December 1992.
