Investors filed lawsuits against International Trading Group Ltd. and Siegel Trading Co., charging the options brokerage firms with engaging in fraudulent and abusive sales practices. 

The suit against ITG, which is based in San Mateo, Calif., was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles; the other was filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago, where Siegel is based.
Both complaints seek class-action status. 

The civil litigation is the first to follow two lawsuits filed earlier this month by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Like the U.S. regulators' suits, the latest complaints allege, among other things, that ITG and Siegel misrepresented to clients the potential for making large profits in commodity futures options, and didn't adequately outline the associated risks.
The suits both also seek undetermined damages, to be trebled under federal racketeering statutes. 

Following the CFTC's action, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange fined Siegel $100,000 and ordered it to withdraw permanently from exchange membership.
The Merc said in part that Siegel "favored its own rather than customers' best interests" by making trades in their accounts without customer approval.
Siegel agreed to the fine and withdrawal of membership without admitting or denying the exchange's allegations. 

A Siegel official referred calls seeking comment to the company's attorney, who couldn't immediately be reached for comment. 

An International Trading Group attorney declined to comment, saying he hadn't seen the lawsuits.
