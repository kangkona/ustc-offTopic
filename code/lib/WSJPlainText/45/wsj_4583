About two dozen Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. employees are leaving the firm after approval of a bylaws change that will soon discourage defections by workers holding Drexel stock. 

A Drexel spokesman said shareholders at the closely held firm approved the bylaws change -- which makes employee shareholders wait significantly longer to cash in their Drexel shares than they used to -- at a special meeting.
He confirmed that about two dozen of Drexel's employees will be leaving before the bylaws change takes effect, but declined to comment further. 

It appears that few key employees are jumping ship, however.
The best-known of the departing employees is David Healy, Drexel's oft-quoted auto industry analyst, Drexel officials said. 

Under the bylaws change, shareholders who leave the firm will have to wait significantly longer to get paid for all of their Drexel holdings than they used to -- about 5.5 years on average under the new plan, compared with 1.4 years previously.
The company says the change puts the firm on equal footing with other closely held securities firms. 

About 1,000 of Drexel's 5,500 employees have purchased and own Drexel shares; others own shares through the firm's employee-bonus plan.
Drexel considers the payout-bylaws change as the final piece in a year of internal restructuring spurred by its settlement in an insider-trading scandal.
