James K. Galbraith's Sept. 14 editorial-page article, "Be a Man, Congress -- Raise Taxes," is a perfect illustration of how some economists can be so blinded by ideology that they deny economic reality.
Most people and even most economists know that cutting taxes on capital increases the after-tax rate of return to capital and causes asset prices to rise not fall as Mr. Galbraith bizarrely asserts. 

Those Americans and members of Congress concerned about reducing the cost of capital to make America more competitive, who wish to revitalize depressed real-estate markets, create jobs, increase the rate of economic growth and increase federal tax revenues will support a capital-gains tax-rate differential.
Those economists, commentators and politicians who are more motivated by a desire to punish success than to create opportunity will oppose a capital-gains tax-rate reduction.
