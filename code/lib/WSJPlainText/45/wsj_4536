IMA Holdings Corp. extended its $28-a-share tender offer for 94% of the shares of American Medical International Inc. 

IMA, an investment group that includes the Pritzker family of Chicago and First Boston Corp., extended its $3.35 billion offer for the Beverly Hills, Calif.-based hospital chain until 12:01 a.m. EDT Oct. 12. 

The offer is for as many as 68.8 million of American Medical's common shares.
IMA said that as of Sept. 26, it had received offers for about 40.4 million shares, including shares issuable upon conversion of convertible debentures. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, American Medical shares closed yesterday at $21.25 a share, down 37.5 cents. 

IMA is extending the offer to await Senate action on a proposal that could eliminate the tax deductibility of certain interest payments or original issue discounts on debt securities used to finance the offer.
The tax considerations, along with recent price drop in high-yield securities market, have fueled doubts among analysts that the transaction can be financed on its original terms.
