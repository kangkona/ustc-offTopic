Lights Out 

Burning coal brings acid rain, 

Wood goes up in smoke, 

A little more exhaust from cars 

And everyone will choke. 

At the rate we use up oil, 

The fossil fuels won't last, 

Electric power is a shock, 

And nuclear -- a blast. 

If we don't find other means, 

Or so say all the sages, 

Our future won't be all that bright, 

More like the old Dark Ages. 

-- Harriet Cooper. 

Frothy Viewing 

These shows are aptly named 

From what I can gather: 

Soap operas tend to work 

Their fans into a lather. 

-- Joshua Adams.
