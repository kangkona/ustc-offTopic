Credit Lyonnais reported a 20% rise in first-half profit and indicated that its second-half results should be at least as strong. 

The state-controlled commercial bank group said group profit rose to 1.49 billion francs ($233.2 million) from 1.24 billion francs a year earlier, and was ahead 16% after payments to minority interests at 1.37 billion francs. 

Capping a week of volume-based, thin-margin earnings by France's biggest commercial banks, the Credit Lyonnais results were driven by brisk credit demand that sent total customer loans up 20% to 562.5 billion francs.
Pressure on interest rates and stiff competition held net interest income from these loans to 12.05 billion francs, however, up only 6% from a year earlier. 

Credit Lyonnais said results were boosted by a rise in net commission income to 4.25 billion francs from 3.45 billion a year earlier.
