Koninklijke Nedlloyd Groep N.V., Rotterdam, Netherlands, said it has agreed in principle to acquire Oeschger Internationale Transport AG, of Switzerland, for a financial consideration that wasn't disclosed. 

Oeschger is a transport and freight forwarding concern with about 150 million Swiss francs (US$92 million) in annual revenues.
It employs 450 people. 

Nedlloyd, a large Dutch transport group, said the acquisition fits in with its strategy of expanding broadly into the European freight transport and product distribution market. 

Nedlloyd and other Dutch transport groups have stated strategies of developing a major European network in logistics management services, an emerging industry in which companies offer clients fully integrated land, sea and air transport and product distribution services.
