Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A. said group profit soared 61% to 1.02 billion francs ($159.6 million) in the first half from 634 million francs a year earlier. 

The Paris-based champagne, cognac, baggage and perfume group said the surge in its unaudited earnings data was based on a 25% revenue gain to 8.63 billion francs from 6.91 billion a year earlier.
Operating profit before financial costs jumped 46% to 2.36 billion francs. 

Operating profit grew fastest for cognac and spirits, as strong Asian demand and widening margins fostered a 51% rise to 900 million francs.
Baggage operations were close behind with a 49% rise to 971 million francs, and the group's champagne and wine operations generated a 34% rise to 305 million francs.
Perfume and beauty products rose 29% to 258 million francs. 

The company noted that it doesn't expect its earnings for all of 1989 to show a growth rate as high as the one recorded in the first half.
It didn't elaborate.
The latest forecast by the company, dating back to June, was for a rise of at least 30% from its 1988 profit of two billion francs.
