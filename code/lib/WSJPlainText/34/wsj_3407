Ford Motor Co. lasted less than a week in trying to keep incentives on its 1990 models more limited than discounts offered by its Big Three rivals. 

Ford said it will offer rebates ranging from $500 to $1,250 on a variety of cars and trucks, including some of its best-selling models.
Last Friday, Ford put rebates of $600 to $1,250 on two 1990 car and two truck models.
The move, which followed broader 1990 incentive offerings from General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp., includes the option of low-rate financing ranging from 6.9% on 24-month loans to 10.9% on 60-month terms. 

Under the new program, Ford is offering buyers the same financing alternative.
It is also slapping rebates of $500 to $4,000 on remaining 1989-model cars and trucks.
Many of the incentives on 1989-model trucks and Lincoln cars don't include the financing option. 

Rebates on the 1990 range from $500 on the Ford Festiva L subcompact and a version of the Ford Mustang to $1,250 on the Ford Bronco II sport-utility vehicle.
Among models added to Ford's discount list are the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable with a $600 rebate, the Ford Probe with rebates of $600 to $800 and the Ford Escort with a $600 cash-back offer.
The Escort ended the 1989 model year edging out the Honda Accord as the best-selling model in the U.S.
But it is scheduled to be replaced with a restyled version next spring.
