Primerica Corp. and A.L. Williams Corp. said their boards approved an accord under which Primerica will acquire the 30.2% of A.L. Williams it doesn't already own. 

A.L. Williams, based in Atlanta, underwrites life-insurance policies and sells mutual funds and home mortgages. 

Terms call for swapping each of the 20.4 million A.L. Williams shares outstanding for 0.82 share of Primerica, a financial-services company. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Primerica common closed at $29, up 50 cents, on volume of 610,600 shares. 

Holders of A.L. Williams stock of record last Monday are scheduled to vote on the transaction at a meeting Nov. 1, the companies said.
