Werter Mambelli, 38 years old, joined Commodore International Ltd. in Europe, as general manager of the Commodore Italiana S.p.
A. subsidiary in Milan. 

The computer maker said 69% of its $940 million in sales for the fiscal year ended June 30 came in Europe.
Most of that was in the consumer market, and Commodore says it has been elbowing for more of the European business market. 

"The new people coming in have had a more professional background," a spokesman said. 

Commodore, during the past year, has named new general managers of its West German, Scandinavian and Swiss operations as well as a new head of operations for all of Europe.
The company also added a new general manager in Australia.
The managers have usually been recruited from competitors, like Compaq Computer Corp., where Mr. Mambelli had been marketing manager for Italy. 

Sergio Simonelli, formerly general manager of Commodore's Italian subsidiary, resigned, the company said.
