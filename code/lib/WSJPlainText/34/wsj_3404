Celgar Pulp Co., a Chinese-American-Canadian joint venture, said it will spend 630 million Canadian dollars (US$536 million) to install pollution-control equipment and to more than double the capacity of its pulp mill in Castlegar, British Columbia. 

Celgar is a venture of China International Trust and Investment Corp., a state-owned investment company, and Power Consolidated (China) Pulp Inc. Power Consolidated is 50%-owned by Power Corp. of Canada, a Montreal financial-services and communications concern, and 50%-owned by a unit of Stone Container Corp., a Chicago paper and packaging concern. 

Celgar said it still has to complete financing arrangements for the expansion project and obtain operating permits.
