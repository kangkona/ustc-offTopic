The South Korean economy, which has suffered from months of sluggishness, showed signs of recovery, the government said. 

The Economic Planning Board said various business indexes in August improved from previous months as industrial production, shipments, sales and manufacturing operations grew. 

The report said the leading economic indicator, which forecasts business conditions two or three months ahead, rose 1.8% in August from July, indicating improved economic activities ahead. 

The coinciding economic indicator, which measures the current business situation, rose 1.6% from the previous month.
Leading and coinciding economic indicators rose in July as well. 

Analysts attribute the improved economic situation to a sharp decrease in the number of labor disputes as well as to growing domestic sales. 

August industrial output rose 6.2% from July, largely because of a sharp growth in domestic sales of vehicles, home appliances and foods.
Industrial output rose 5.5% from a year ago.
August domestic sales rose 2.3% from July and 7.2% from a year ago. 

Factories operated at 81.7% of capacity, the highest level of the year.
