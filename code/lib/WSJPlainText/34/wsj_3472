Italy's public-sector deficit narrowed to 65.060 trillion lire ($47.14 billion) for the first eight months of 1989 from a revised 75.694 trillion lire a year earlier, the Treasury announced. 

The year-earlier deficit was revised from an estimate of 75.992 trillion lire. 

The sharp drop in the deficit is because of a change in tax-payment regulations.
Under new rules, self-employed professionals and shopkeepers are required to pay 40% of their anticipated tax liability for 1989 before May 31.
Before they were required to pay 80% of anticipated tax liability for the full year before Nov. 30. 

As a result, tax collection in May was sharply higher than in the previous year, but this will be compensated by lower tax revenues in November.
