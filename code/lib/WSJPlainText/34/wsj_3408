Ogden Corp. said it agreed to acquire ERC International Inc. for stock valued at about $84 million at the current market price. 

Under the terms, holders of ERC, a Fairfax, Va., provider of engineering and technical services to the U.S. military and others, will receive about 0.406 share of Ogden common for each ERC share held.
In all, about 2.5 million Ogden shares will be swapped for six million ERC shares.
The transaction will result in an increase in Ogden shares outstanding to 42.5 million from 40 million, an Ogden official said. 

Ogden, a New York-based engineering-services company, said the transaction includes ERC's 69% stake in ERC Environmental & Energy Services Co. 

Before Ogden and ERC disclosed their tentative deal around 3 p.m. EDT yesterday, ERC stock was halted in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
When it resumed shortly before the bell, the stock jumped to $12 from $9.375; it closed at $12.25 a share, the Big Board's leading percentage gainer for the day. 

Ogden closed at $33.50, down 12.5 cents, in Big Board composite trading. 

The transaction requires approval by the boards and shareholders of each company and clearance by certain governmental agencies.
