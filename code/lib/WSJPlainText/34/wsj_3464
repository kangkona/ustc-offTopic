President Bush proposed a $200 million grant for Poland as the U.S. contribution to a possible $1 billion international stabilization fund. 

In addition, the White House confirmed that Mr. Bush will send a U.S. delegation to Warsaw "within the next few weeks" to help the Polish government plan the best uses for the money.
The administration hasn't decided which government officials will be included, but White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater stressed that the group largely will be made up of private bankers, financiers and agriculture experts. 

The new Polish government has sought the $1 billion stabilization fund, to be financed by Western nations, to help it get by while it revamps its socialist economy. 

Mr. Bush's decision on the $200 million grant, which had been expected, represents an attempt to head off congressional approval of a far larger aid package that the administration argues wouldn't be helpful.
Both the House and the Senate are considering adding hundreds of millions of dollars to a $100 million "enterprise fund" Mr. Bush initiated to help generate private economic activity in Poland.
Some lawmakers also are trying to increase the $108 million in food aid that the president has approved for Poland. 

The White House argues that the additional millions probably can't be absorbed immediately and that further aid is best directed to the stabilization fund. 

The stabilization grant sought by Mr. Bush must be approved by Congress and is contingent on Poland's reaching an agreement on an economic-reform plan with the International Monetary Fund, the White House said.
In addition to the stabilization fund, Poland is seeking about $700 million in loans from the IMF as well as loans from the World Bank, said Robert Blackwill, special assistant to the president for European and Soviet affairs.
