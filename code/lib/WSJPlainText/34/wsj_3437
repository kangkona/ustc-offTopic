Standard & Poor's Corp. said it downgraded Bank of Boston Corp. 's senior debt to single-A-minus from double-A-minus, affecting about $1.1 billion of debt. 

The rating agency also lowered the bank holding company's subordinated debt and preferred stock to triple-B-plus from single-A plus, commerical paper to A-2 from A-1-plus, and letter of credit supported issues and certificates of deposits of First National Bank of Boston to A/A-1 from AA minus/A-1-plus. 

Bank of Boston Canada's and Boston Australia Ltd. 's commerical paper was also lowered to A-1 from A-1-plus. 

The ratings follow the company's announcement of an expected $125 million loss for the third quarter, related to a $370 million increase in its loan-loss reserve. 

"We're disappointed that we're being downgraded.
But despite our recent actions we still consider ourselves to be very financially sound," said John Kahwaty, Bank of Boston's director of investor relations.
