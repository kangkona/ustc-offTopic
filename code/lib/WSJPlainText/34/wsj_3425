Diversified Energies Inc. said it may take a special charge against third-quarter earnings following an unfavorable ruling by a Texas jury. 

The energy-services concern said the jury found in favor of closely held Genesis Producing Co. in litigation between the two companies, and ordered Diversified to pay the Corpus Christi company $28.4 million.
That figure doesn't include attorney's fees and interest costs. 

Diversified said it will appear before the trial judge in about a month to appeal the jury's decision and to seek a reduction in the amount awarded. 

Diversified said the judgment will be taken as a charge against third-quarter earnings, if the judge's final award is made in time to meet Securities and Exchnage Commission reporting requirements. 

In the year-earlier third quarter, the company had a loss of $3 million on revenue of $102.8 million.
To date, Diversified has reserved $2 million against potential costs. 

Diversified said Genesis Producing, formerly known as Genesis Petroleum Corp., sued it in state district court in Harris County, Texas, in 1985 after Diversified terminated a drilling agreement between the two companies. 

A spokeswoman for Diversified said the agreement was terminated because "drilling results weren't positive." Subsequently, Genesis requested $5.4 million for additional 18 exploration wells that were drilled after the agreement was ended. "We refused to pay, and they filed suit," the spokeswoman said. 

Under the agreement, a Diversified unit was to provide primary financing for the venture and Genesis was to be the operator.
Genesis officials couldn't be reached for comment. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Diversified shares closed at $32.75, down $1.50.
