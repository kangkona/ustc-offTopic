Young & Rubicam said it expects that it and possibly some of its employees will be indicted by a federal grand jury in New Haven, Conn., for allegedly bribing Jamaican officials in its successful attempt to win Jamaica's tourist-advertising account in 1981. 

The New York-based advertising agency was a subject of a grand-jury investigation into alleged bribery several years ago but that probe didn't result in any action by the jury at that time. 

In a statement Young & Rubicam said it was "shocked and dismayed" by the expected action and said that the expected charges "are without substance or merit." The Jamaica account bills less than $10 million annually. 

Young & Rubicam created the high-profile "Come Back to Jamaica" campaign but the Jamaican Tourist Board, nevertheless, put up the account for review earlier this year.
After a competition with several other agencies Young & Rubicam retained the account.
