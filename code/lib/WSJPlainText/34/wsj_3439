Oce-Van der Grinten N.V. said that, fueled by surprisingly resilient economic growth and business investment in key markets, its profit jumped 13% in the fiscal third quarter, ended Aug. 31, to 19.4 million guilders ($9.1 million) from 17.2 million guilders a year earlier. 

The Dutch copier and office-systems group added that per-share net income rose to 6.62 guilders from 5.88 guilders. 

And encouraged by buoyant "better-than-expected" earnings thus far in 1989, the company said it expects profit for all fiscal 1989 to rise 10% from a year earlier to about 83.7 million guilders.
The company posted only a 1.3% earnings gain in 1988. 

Up to now, Oce hadn't been willing publicly to project an earnings-growth figure for the year.
A spokesman termed the forecast an improvement from earlier expectations.
Separately, Oce said it plans to split its shares 5-for-1 next year.
The split will be proposed at the company's annual meeting next April.
