Complaints have been filed against a division of General Mills Inc. and O'Donnell-Usen Fisheries Corp. of Boston for allegedly discharging inadequately treated oil, grease and other pollutants through a Gloucester, Mass., wastewater treatment plant. 

The U.S. attorney's office said the complaints allege that the companies, which operate fish processing facilities in Gloucester, Mass., discharged pollutants in violation of federal standards and the city's limits. 

In addition to other penalties, the complaints seek orders requiring Gorton Group, a division of Minneapolis-based General Mills, and O'Donnell-Usen to construct pretreatment systems that would meet the companies' discharge limits. 

In response to the complaints, David Weber, vice president of operations for Gorton Group, said, "General Mills and the Gorton Group have already spent over $1.5 million in designing and building a new wastewater pretreatment system at our Gloucester facility." 

He added that the company has worked closely with the city of Gloucester and has "cooperated completely with the Environmental Protection Agency in attempting to resolve all pretreatment issues." 

Attorneys representing O'Donnell-Usen Fisheries Corp. had no comment.
