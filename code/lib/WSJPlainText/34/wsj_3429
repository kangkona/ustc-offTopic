London share prices tumbled after the Bank of England forced a one-point rise in commercial banks' base lending rates to 15% from 14%. 

In Tokyo, interest rate worries were muted and stocks rolled up their second consecutive gain, helped by institutional and investment trust fund buying near the close.
Most other major European exchanges also were steady to higher despite a round of interest-rate increases in several countries. 

The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 30.5 at 2281.6; it was down more than 40 at its intraday low.
The Financial Times 30-share index fell 23.0 to 1867.2.
Volume was 491.4 million shares, compared with 472.1 million Wednesday. 

The British central bank caused the rate rise by telling discount houses that its borrowing facilities would be available at 15%, a full percentage point above the level of recent weeks.
The government's decision to tighten monetary policy further was part of a coordinated set of European rate increases. 

The moves were led by the West German Bundesbank, which raised its discount and Lombard rates a full point to 6% and 8%, respectively.
The West German discount rate is the fee the central bank charges member banks for loans, and the Lombard rate is the effective ceiling on overnight loans. 

Dealers said the Bank of England's move sent the stock market into a free fall, with market makers frantically marking prices lower. "It was extremely hectic," said one dealer. "People just weren't sure how far the market would fall." 

According to traders, the rate rise heightened already strong fears that U.K. corporate profits will be harmed by high interest rates. "The market can't go on making out that higher interest rates aren't going to seriously harm a lot of companies' earnings," one dealer said.
Of the FT-SE 100 stocks, only nine ended higher, with two unchanged and 89 lower.
Of the few that managed to gain, Jaguar again stood out.
Rumors that General Motors and Ford Motor are gearing up for a bidding war for the U.K. luxury car maker helped send its shares 36 pence higher to 669 pence ($10.72) on heavy volume of 9.3 million shares.
One dealer said market rumors had the two biggest U.S. auto makers ready to pay "astronomical sums" for Jaguar. 

British Airways ended 1 1/2 firmer at 212 after news that developer Donald Trump launched a $120-a-share offer for AMR's American Airlines. "There was a lot of U.S. buying of British Airways," one dealer said. 

Construction issues and stocks sensitive to consumer spending retreated sharply.
Among retailers, Kingfisher fell 15 to 310, Burton fell 10 to 222, Dixons slipped 7 to 134, Marks & Spencer declined 6 to 192, and Ratners fell 11 to 

Morgan Grenfell rose 30 to 399 on rumors that a number of European bank groups are considering building a stake in the U.K. merchant bank.
Morgan Grenfell said it isn't involved in talks with any such parties. 

Among major blue-chips, Glaxo eased 15 to #14.65, B.A.T fell 11 to 855, and Rank Organisation declined 22 to 906. 

Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 issues, which managed a scant 16.43-point gain Wednesday, rose 140.19 to 35522.99.
Volume on the first section was estimated at 900 million shares, compared with 888 million Wednesday.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 579-395, with 162 remaining unchanged.
The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the first section, which lost 9.40 points Wednesday, was down 2.41, or 0.09%, at 2676.99. 

In early trading Friday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index sank 156.62 points to 35366.37. 

Traders attributed Thursday's gains to a relative abundance of money flowing into the market.
Institutional investors closed their midyear books last week, when the first half of the Japanese fiscal year ended, and thus are no longer restricted from active trading. 

Concern over currency fluctuations and expectations of the West German interestrate increase encouraged investors to "get on and then off quickly on one issue after another," a trader at Dai-Ichi Securities said, describing an aggressive desire to take profits quickly. 

Individual Japanese investors spread buying widely, underscoring the market's lack of focus, traders said. 

Without a reliable "pillar" for the market, high-priced issues tended to attract investors seeking to reap benefits from the wide price swings common among these issues. 

Some of the issues were pushed up by a major brokerage house and individual buyers.
But institutions also joined in, lured by a promise of quick profits in the high-priced arena, traders said. 

Fanuc rebounded to 7,950 yen ($56.14) a share, up 190 yen, Pioneer Electronic advanced 270 to 6,030, Sony was up 300 at 8,700, and Kyocera gained 100 to 5,350. 

Other winners included textile issues, whose laggard status and relatively low prices -- mostly below 1,000 yen a share -- attracted investors, traders said. 

Toyobo advanced 23 to 930, Kurabo Industries gained 12 to 815, Kuraray was up 40 to 1,730, and Kanebo gained 17 to 898 yen. 

Sugar refiners attracted buying interest after a local news report pointed out an improvement in sugar prices over the past few months.
Their laggard status also encouraged buying, traders said.
Taito gained 10 to 1,400, and Nippon Beet Sugar was up 30 to 907. 

Among precision machinery makers, Canon gained 30 to 1,870, and Olympus was up 50 to 1,750. 

Petroleum issues also gained.
Showa Shell was up 60 at 1,520, and Mitsubishi Oil gained 50 to 1,340. 

Sapporo Breweries rose 40 to 1,840 as its land holdings in central Tokyo continued to intrigue investors, traders said. 

Other winners included Clarion, up 130 at 1,160, and Fuji Photo Film, which gained 130 to 4,000. 

Retail issues ended mixed as some issues were sold on profit-taking, traders said. 

In other European markets, shares closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich and Brussels, were mixed in Amsterdam and fell in Stockholm and Milan.
South African gold stocks closed lower. 

Elsewhere, share prices rose in Hong Kong and Manila, were mixed in Singapore and fell in Taipei, Wellington, Sydney and Seoul. 

Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.
To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
The percentage change is since year-end.
