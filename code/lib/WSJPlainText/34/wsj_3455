Invacare Corp., Elyria, Ohio, said a shortage from sales and a one-time charge related to a restructuring resulted in break-even third-quarter earnings. 

The company had said earnings would be down somewhat for the quarter from the year-earlier's $1.7 million, or 31 cents a share, on sales of $41.7 million. 

Invacare said sales were about 10% above the year-earlier level but several million dollars below company projections. "The level of sales improvement is not high enough to offset the higher expenses due to higher material costs and costs associated with starting up a manufacturing plant and a distribution facility," the company said. 

The maker of home-health-care and extended-care equipment blamed the sales shortage on delays in shipments because of a new warehouse-management system, reduction in demand from home-care dealers as they adapt to new medicare reinbursement policies, and product shortages.
Results are expected to be reported in mid-November.
