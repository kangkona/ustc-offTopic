Assets of the 469 money-market funds tracked by the Investment Company Institute declined $429.3 million, to $348.94 billion, for the week ended Wednesday. 

"Total assets of money-market funds dropped slightly last week, recording their first weekly decline in over three months," Jacob Dreyer, vice president of the Washington trade group said. "Assets held in general purpose and broker-dealer accounts, however, rose for the 19th week in a row even though the rate of their increase slowed dramatically from the torrid pace of summer months." 

Institutional-type funds posted losses in assets as yields rose on direct money-market instruments, mostly on large-denomination certificates of deposit, Mr. Dreyer said.
Institutional investors are more sensitive to yield changes than individuals and generally move funds very quickly in response to changes. 

For the week ended Tuesday, according to Banxquote Money Markets, a six-month certificate of deposit with a minimum deposit of $90,000 sold by a major bank, was up 0.06 percentage point to 8.29%. 

Also, for the week ended Tuesday, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, yields inched up to 8.62% on sevenday compounded money funds, from 8.60% the week earlier. 

Assets of the 140 institutional funds tracked by the Investment Company Institute fell $646 million, to $83.11 billion. 

The 233 general-purpose funds increased $26.5 million, to $113.56 billion, while 96 broker-dealer funds registered a rise of $190.2 million, to $152.26 billion.
