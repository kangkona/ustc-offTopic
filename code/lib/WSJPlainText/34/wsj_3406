Bergen Bank and Den norske Creditbanken agreed to open merger talks which, if successful, would create a Norwegian bank able for the first time to compete on roughly equal terms with its biggest rivals in neighboring Nordic countries. 

The proposed merger of two of Norway's big three banks stunned Oslo's financial markets.
Most market analysts have long argued that Norwegian banks must join forces to survive in integrated, deregulated European financial markets. 

But moves in that direction had been thwarted by the Norwegian government's restrictive anti-trust policy.
Even so, market speculation persisted about a big banking merger -- but Bergen Bank and Christiania Bank & Kreditkasse, Norway's biggest bank, were cited as the most likely partners. 

Bergen Bank's choice of DnC -- a troubled bank still shaky after huge losses in recent years -- came as a big surprise.
So did the government's swift about-face on the previously prickly anti-trust issue. 

Norway's Finance Ministry said that it was favorable to the planned merger.
Though conceding that the combination would contradict earlier policy, a ministry spokesman said the huge losses incurred by Norway's banks since 1986 and challenges posed by the European Community's 1992 single-market plan make it necessary "to allow our banks to adapt and organize themselves more effectively."
