Qintex Australia Ltd. moved to stem a plunge in its share price by reassuring investors that its planned participation in the acquisition of MGM/UA Communications Co. of the U.S. won't overstretch the company. 

Qintex shares dropped as low as 40 Australian cents (31 U.S. cents) this week on the Australian Stock Exchange, from A$1.50 when the acquisition was proposed in March. 

Investors are concerned the acquisition will burden the relatively small Australian resorts and entertainment concern with excessive debt. 

Moreover, investors are worried about the value of Qintex's television stations in Australia, following the write-down of a rival company's stations.
And a protracted strike by domestic airline pilots could trim revenue at Qintex resorts, some investors believe. 

Christopher Skase, Qintex chairman, said the $1.5 billion acquisition involves "a maximum incremental liability for Qintex Australia in the form of bank debt associated with the investment" of $50 million. 

Qintex Australia Ltd. is affiliated with Qintex Group, the acquiring entity. 

In a statement, Mr. Skase said Qintex Australia's role in the acquisition has been to coordinate an investor group in which Qintex will have "a total financial participation" ranging between $125 million and $150 million. 

Other investors include about 10 "major international companies, many of whom have an involvement in the broadcasting and entertainment industry," he said. 

Mr. Skase said MGM/UA has made "additional financial requests" that he didn't disclose.
He said Qintex is considering the requests. 

In Beverly Hills, Calif., officials at MGM/UA declined to comment on the additional financial requests.
