Acme-Cleveland Corp. said a federal court in Nebraska entered a $10 million judgment against the company in favor of Vickers Inc., a subsidary of Trinova Corp. 

Vickers alleged that a subsidiary of Acme-Cleveland failed to fulfill a contract obligation to provide a fully automated Flexible Manufacturing System in 1983. 

The maker of metal-cutting tools, electronic equipment and telecommunications products said it is considering an appeal.
