National Education Corp., Irvine, Calif., said it expects to report a third-quarter loss of about $6 million, or 20 cents a share, primarily because of troubles at its Applied Learning unit. 

A spokesman said the vocational training company also is searching for bank credit to replace current unsecured loans of about $62 million, in case these, in light of its third-quarter loss announcement, are called in.
He also said Kidder, Peabody & Co. is "conducting a strategic review" of its options," but the spokesman declined to specify whether a possible sale of National Education was under consideration. 

The estimated third-quarter loss compares with year-earlier profit of $12.5 million, or 44 cents a share, on revenue of $103 million.
The company declined to disclose projected third-quarter revenue. 

National Education, a vocational and industrial training and educational publishing company, said it expects the Applied Learning unit's fourth-quarter revenue to be "significantly below last year's."
