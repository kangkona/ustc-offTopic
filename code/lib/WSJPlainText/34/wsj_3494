River Forest Bancorp said it signed a letter of intent to acquire Madison Financial Corp. in a transaction valued at about $17.2 million. 

The bank holding company said it agreed to pay $11 a share in cash for Chicago-based Madison, which has about 1.5 million common shares outstanding.
Assuming conversion of certain common stock equivalents and the exercise of existing stock options, the total price will reach $17.2 million, River Forest said. 

River Forest said the purchase price will also be subject to possible adjustments for Madison's earnings and common-share dividends through the closing, which is expected in early spring. 

Madison, a bank-holding company, has total assets of $180 million.
