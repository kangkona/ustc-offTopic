Guinness PLC, the diversified British beverage group, reported a 34% jump in first-half pretax profit, paced by strong results in its distilled spirits division and contributions from its investment in France's Moet-Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA. 

Pretax profit increased to #246 million ($394 million) from #183 million a year earlier.
The climb is in line with market expectations, which ranged between #240 million and #260 million. 

Profit after taxes and minority interests and before special items rose 36% to #168 million from #123 million, with earnings per share rising to 17.9 pence from 13.5 pence. 

Guinness said it will pay an interim dividend of 4.40 pence a share, up from the midyear payout of 3.50 pence last year.
