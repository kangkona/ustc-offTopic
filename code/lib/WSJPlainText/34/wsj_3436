Next PLC, a trendy British clothing retailer hit hard by falling consumer demand, reported a 48% drop in pretax profit for the first half. 

The decline, to #16.2 million ($25.9 million) from #30.9 million a year earlier, exceeded many analysts' expectations. 

Profit after taxes slumped slightly more than 50% to #10.4 million from #21.1 million, with per-share earnings declining to 2.81 pence from 5.82 pence. 

Despite the negative turn in earnings, Next said it will hold its interim-dividend payment equal to the year-earlier 2.7 pence a share.
