The Chesebrough-Pond's Inc. unit of Unilever N.V. said it plans to close its Faberge Inc. facility in Mahwah, N.J., by June. 

Of the data-processing facility's 350 employees, at least 100 will be offered other jobs, the company said.
Faberge currently has 1,200 employees. 

In August, Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and home products conglomerate, paid $1.55 billion for Faberge's toiletries, cosmetics and fragrances businesses. 

Chesebrough-Pond's said the closing of the Mahwah facility reflects a consolidation of Faberge operations into Chesebrough-Pond's.
The data-processing, finance and research work that has been done in Mahwah will be moved to Chesebrough-Pond's facilities in Trumbull, Conn., and New York City, the company said. 

Employees who lose their jobs will receive two to four weeks' severance pay for each year of service, plus outplacement and other services, the company said.
