Polaroid Corp. said it introduced a variety of office and business imaging products, including portable overhead projectors, one-step flash cameras, and instant slide printers.
The Cambridge, Mass., company, attending a trade show here, said it has begun a nationwide distribution of such products. 

The expansion in distribution follows a regional marketing program, which began in May, promoting imaging products in the Northeast and Southwest. 

Most of the photographic equipment and film company's new products are available through office-supply catalogs, office-products dealers and wholesalers, Polaroid said.
