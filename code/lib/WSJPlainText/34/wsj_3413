Mony Real Estate Investors, whose trustees approved a liquidation plan last year, said its management estimates that the breakup value of the real-estate investment trust should be "in excess of $9 a share." 

The company has 10,650,000 shares outstanding, giving it an indicated value of $95.9 million, under the plan. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the company closed yesterday at $8.625 a share, up 37.5 cents. 

Mony said it's aiming to liquidate by May 31, 1990.
