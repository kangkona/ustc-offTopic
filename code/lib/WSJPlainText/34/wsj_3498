Old Home Week 

Homecoming Day at most colleges 

Fulfills some sentimental cravings, 

As old grads and parents can visit 

The home of their life savings. 

-- Edward F. Dempsey. 

No Middle Ground 

One retirement thought 

I can't disregard: 

Taking it easy 

Is often quite hard. 

-- Joshua Adams.
