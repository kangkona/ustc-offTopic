HEI Corp. said it adopted a shareholder rights plan in which common stockholders will receive the right to purchase one common share for each share held. 

The owner and operator of general acute-care hospitals in southeast Texas said the rights entitle stockholders to buy one share of HEI common stock for $12.50, and are exercisable if a stake of 20% or more is acquired.
The rights plan also includes provisions for common stock purchases and distribution under certain other types of takeover or merger transactions. 

HEI said the rights plan is strictly a "defense mechanism" to protect its shareholders and wasn't adopted in response to a specific event.
