A seat on the New York Stock Exchange changed hands at the lowest price in nearly three years. 

At $475,000, yesterday's Big Board seat sale fetched the lowest price since the $460,000 sale of a seat on Nov. 3, 1986, according to exchange data.
Today's price is 59% lower than the peak level of $1.15 million set Sept. 21, 1987. 

The relatively low sale price, off $25,000 from the prior sale, comes the day after major stock indexes, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average, closed at all-time highs.
But analysts say the price of Big Board seats is reflective of the volume of stock trading and commission levels, not share prices. 

Big Board seat prices offer a "window as to what some people think future volume will be," says Perrin Long, securities industry analyst at Lipper Analytical Services Inc. Mr. Long says that through the first nine months of the year, stock-trading volume was marginally higher than the same period of 1988.
When volume flattens or falls, stock-exchange seat prices stabilize or drop, he says. 

Since he isn't looking for any large increases in stock-trading volume for the next year or so, Mr. Long says he expects Big Board seat prices to hold in the $400,000 to $500,000 range during that period. 

In the heady pre-crash days of 1987, seven Big Board seats were sold for $1 million or more, the last of those coming Oct. 15, 1987, at $1,025,000.
On Oct. 19, the day the industrial average fell 508 points, a Big Board seat changed hands at $875,000.
Seat prices then fell further. 

The highest seat-sale price in 1988 was $820,000 on May 10, Big Board data show.
Prices began to drop in last year's second half.
In 1989, the high seat-sale price was $675,000 on March 3.
The nine seats sold from April 27 through Tuesday were all at prices from $500,000 to $550,000.
