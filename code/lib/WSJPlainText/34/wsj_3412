Greyhound Lines Inc. said it is cutting bus fares by as much as 20% to try to lure fall travelers away from the airlines. 

The intercity bus carrier said the fare cuts -- its third this year -- are part of a strategy of building passenger volume through aggressive pricing. 

Ralph Borland, vice president, marketing, said the fare cuts were timed to coincide with some increases in air fares. "We want people to know that the cost of travel hasn't gone out of sight and that there are cheaper alternatives," he said. 

The cuts, ranging from 5% to 20%, apply to trips of less than 300 miles and take effect today, the company said. 

Earlier price reductions have contributed to a rise in traffic, a Greyhound spokeswoman said.
Passenger miles traveled rose 17% in the first half of this year after a 9.2% increase in 1988.
In 1987, when the bus line was acquired by GLI Holding Co., passenger miles rose 2.7%, the first such increase in five years, the spokeswoman said. 

The company also is trying to increase its appeal to more affluent travelers through year-round marketing and a $100 million terminal improvement program, Mr. Borland said.
