The suit, filed in federal court, asks $100,000 in damages, $10 million in punitive damages and an injunction halting the commercials.

In addition to McDonald's, the Los Angeles-based ad agency Davis, Ball & Colombatto is named in the suit.
DBC officials couldn't be reached to comment, nor could McDonald's officials.
