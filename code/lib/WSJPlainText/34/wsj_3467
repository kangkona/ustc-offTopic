Travelers Corp. expects claims from Hurricane Hugo will result in a pretax charge of about $60 million against third-quarter earnings. 

In the year-earlier quarter, the company earned $91 million, or 91 cents a share. 

This estimate covers losses in the southeastern U.S. and the Caribbean.
The company expects to receive more than 9,000 auto and property damage claims.
