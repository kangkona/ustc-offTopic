Bank Building & Equipment Corp. of America, citing recently discovered accounting discrepancies, said it will restate results for the first three quarters of this fiscal year. 

The St. Louis-based company said its auditors, in preparing to review results for the year ending Oct. 31 uncovered "certain errors in recording receivables and payables" at its Loughman Cabinet division. 

While the auditors review the matter further, Bank Building said, it estimates the after-tax effects on earnings for the fiscal year will be "at least" a negative $1.3 million.
For the nine months ended July 31, Bank Building had a net loss of $1 million on revenue of $66.5 million. 

The discovery will require that earnings be restated for the prior three quarters and possibly earlier periods as well, the company said.
Bank Building said it has fired the manager of the division. 

In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange, Bank Building shares tumbled $1.125 to close at $4.25 a share.
