A Sept. 20 editorial, "The Privileged Class," discussed a federal judge's decision to overturn so-called suppression of speech rules at the University of Michigan.
The editorial said the decision could affect similar rules affecting speech at Stanford, Duke, Wisconsin and Emory.
In fact, Duke University does not have rules circumscribing the content of speech on its campus.
