When former General Electric Co. executive Richard Miller took the president's job at troubled Wang Laboratories in August, some folk wondered what could have induced him to do it. 

Part of the answer appears in Wang's proxy statement for its Oct. 24 annual meeting.
It discloses that Mr. Miller was guaranteed a minimum of $1 million a year for three years.
That makes him Wang's most highly paid employee.
The sum is twice what his boss, founder, chairman and chief executive officer, An Wang, earned in the year ended June 30.
Mr. Miller's predecessor, Frederick A. Wang, who resigned under pressure from his father in August, earned $397,611 last year. 

The unguaranteed portion of Mr. Miller's employment pact may be tough to realize, however.
The document says "a performance bonus based on net profits for fiscal 1990 is also provided for." Most analysts expect Wang to report a loss for the full year. 

Mr. Miller also gets the right to buy two million shares of Wang's Class B stock at $5.75 each.
That could be worth a lot if the stock rises, but there aren't any assurances; yesterday, in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange, Wang Class B stock sank to a 52-week low, closing at $4.75, down 50 cents, on volume of about one million shares.
Its 52-week high is $10.875. 

Separately, Wang disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it has reduced its work force about 2,300, or 8.5%, since July 1, bringing the total number of employees in continuing operations to about 24,500.
