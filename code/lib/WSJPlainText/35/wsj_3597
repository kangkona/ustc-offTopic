Societe Generale reported a 21% increase in first-half profit and said full-year earnings will grow 15% to 20% from a year earlier. 

Marc Vienot, chairman, said the French commercial banking group's consolidated net income rose to 1.747 billion francs ($272.9 million) in the first half from 1.438 billion francs a year earlier. 

Mr. Vienot linked the gain, in part, to the brisk pace of credit demand, as higher loan volume more than offset a squeeze on margins and allowed the bank to post a 5% rise in lending profits. 

The executive also cited a strong rise in income from asset management, good results from the foreign network and a satisfactory performance in specialized financing.
Mr. Vienot said the only area of disappointment in the first half was in the bond market, where an inversion of the yield curve limited profit to about half the targeted level.
