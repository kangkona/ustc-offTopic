Microsoft leaped 6 1/2 to 75 1/2, a new high. 

The buying quickly spread to other technology issues. "Microsoft took them all with it," said Ed Nazzella, executive vice president of over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton. 

The Sun and Microsoft announcements stood in stark relief to International Business Machines' recent bleak outlook, which helped sink the computer giant's stock to a 52-week low recently. 

Traders were wary as to how long the gains in the technology sector would hold.
The group has been notoriously fickle in the past, fraught with false starts and disappointing swoons, they said. 

But Mr. Nazzella of Shearson said he expects the current strong demand to carry over into further gains. "There were nothing but buyers and a lack of supply," he said."Buyers are really reaching." 

But Len Hefter, managing director of trading at Jefferies & Co. 's over-the-counter desk in Dallas, took a cooler view. "This market has a lot of moods to it," he said. "There's no way of telling." With the fourth quarter just beginning, he said, "There's no rush to jump in.
Investors still have time."
