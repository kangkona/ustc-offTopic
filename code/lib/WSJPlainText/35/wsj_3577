First American Bank & Trust said it signed a second cease-and-desist order in as many years with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Florida Department of Banking. 

The order requires, among other things, that the troubled bank raise $65 million in primary capital by June 1990, and raise its capital ratio to 5.5% by Dec. 31, 1990.
Its capital was $46 million, or 3.13%, as of June 30. 

In addition, the order limits further investments in all subsidiaries, and requires First American to charge off certain loans and review its trust operations, specifically the Employee Stock Ownership Trust.
In national over-the-counter trading, the bank's stock closed at 87.5 cents a share, down 12.5 cents. 

Yesterday's announcement follows months of turmoil at the $1.5 billion-asset bank, starting with founder Roy W. Talmo's resignation in May as chairman and chief executive.
He was succeeded as chairman by Palm Beach attorney Robert M. Montgomery Jr. James L. Billmeyer, president and chief operating officer, assumed the additional duties of chief executive officer. 

Mr. Montgomery was ousted a few weeks later by Mr. Talmo, who is the bank's controlling shareholder, and replaced by Palm Beach investor John E. Nicolo.
Then, Mr. Nicolo quit shortly afterward to make room for William W. Landa, a Miami real estate developer.
Last month, Mr. Billmeyer resigned after only nine months as president. 

The bank agreed to a first administrative order in late 1987, after the bank began suffering big losses under Mr. Talmo's much-criticized policies toward investing in big real estate ventures.
The bank tried changing its strategy to a more traditional, conservative operating mode, but was unable to stem the losses.
Its stock has plummeted from a high of about $15 in 1986 to a low of about 87.5 cents earlier this year.
