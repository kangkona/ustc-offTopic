Xylogics Inc., Burlington, Mass., said it expects revenue for the first half of fiscal 1990 to be about 10% lower than the $21 million predicted by industry analysts. 

The maker of computer disk and tape controllers also said earnings per share for the first half of 1990 probably won't meet analysts' estimates of up to 53 cents. 

The expected results stem from an expected decline in shipments of its SMD disk controllers to its largest customer. 

For the first half of fiscal 1989, ended April 30, the company reported net of $1.9 million, or 59 cents a share, on revenue of $15.1 million. 

The company said it is discussing additional products with its largest customer.
However, should Xylogics be successful in the talks, the new business wouldn't "appreciably" affect revenue for two or three quarters.
