It is ironic that Paul A. Gigot decided to spotlight Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, perhaps Congress's most literate member, in his column excoriating the congressional frank (Potomac Watch, Sept. 15). 

I helped produce (not write, produce; no one reading the inimitable prose could possibly doubt the authorship) Sen. Moynihan's newsletter for several years while serving as his press secretary.
I was exposed to many of his colleagues' efforts.
None that I can recall were more informative, better written or less concerned with highlighting the official's latest meeting with the state's igloo manufacturers (or other visiting constituent groups). 

As for the other franked material sent by members of the House and Senate, I would suggest that as soon as the press provides detailed explanations of the hundreds of votes and dozens of complex issues crossing a congressman's desk each year, the members might feel less inclined to keep the folks back home informed.

Mr. Gigot misses the central point about Sen. Moynihan's priorities.
He's an excellent writer, perhaps the best in the Senate.
He loves having his work read -- what writer doesn't?
He believes deeply in its educational value: moral, political, state, national, international.
He'd like to be re-elected, to continue to serve; and writing is his best tool. 

The Republican strategy for banning unsolicited congressional mailings is aimed primarily not so much at fairness in elections as at too many Democrats in Congress.
Ideally it ought to be aimed at fairness in elections and too few women in Congress -- about 7% in the House, only 2% in the Senate. 

My own recipe?
Cut the franking privilege to specified dollar limits, intending only enough for solicited mailings.
And elect more women -- Lynn Martin, for example, of Illinois, to the Senate.
