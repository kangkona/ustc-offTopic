Accounting firms Coopers & Lybrand and Deloitte Haskins & Sells agreed to merge their British operations, forming the largest accounting firm in the U.K. 

The plan followed a decision by Deloitte's U.K. affiliate to carve itself out of that firm's merger with Touche Ross & Co. Deloitte officials said they found they had "many important differences" with the Touche Ross U.K. affiliate, while they found "cultural compatibility" with Coopers.
The two firms negotiated the agreement during the past three weeks, officials said. 

Meanwhile, Coopers & Lybrand -- one of three large accounting firms that hasn't entered a large merger in recent months -- may merge with other dissident Deloitte affiliates in the Netherlands and Australia, officials from the firm said. 

According to the most recent fiscal-year results for both firms, Coopers & Lybrand's British oerations took #225 million ($360 million) in annual fees; Deloitte operations brought in #189 million.
Coopers has total personnel of 5,651; Deloitte has 4,844 employees. 

Brandon Gough, senior partner at Coopers in the U.K., will be the chairman of the merged concern.
John Bullock, senior partner of Deloitte's U.K. affiliate, will be a deputy chairman.
Both will hold the title of joint senior partner.
A name for the merged firm hasn't yet been chosen.
