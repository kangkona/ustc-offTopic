Citing weakened earnings prospects, Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered its ratings on this Calabasas, Calif., aerospace concern's senior debt and preliminary shelf-registered debt to single-A from single-A-plus.
The downgrade affects $1 billion of debt.
Lockheed earlier said it expected to post a third-quarter net loss of $35 million, reflecting $165 million in charges on several fixed-price contracts.
S&P characterized Lockheed as a company in transition, seeking to find work to replace the recently completed C-5B Air Force transport program in time of diminished defense contracts.
Lockheed declined comment on the downgrade. 

MICROPOLIS Corp. (Chatsworth, Calif.) -- Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered its ratings on this Chatsworth, Calif.-based disk-drive maker's $75 million convertible subordinated debentures to triple-C from single-B-minus.
S&P said its action reflects "significantly diminished liquidity." 

UNITED TECHNOLOGIES Corp. 's double-A-minus senior debt rating, single-A-plus subordinated debt rating and single-A-1-plus commercial paper rating were affirmed by Standard & Poor's Corp.
The move follows the plan by the Hartford, Conn., maker of defense and industrial products to acquire Gibbons, Green, Van Ameron gen's 46% stake in SGC Holding Co. United Technologies already holds 46% of SGC, the parent of Sheller-Globe Corp.; SGC managers hold the rest.
Despite the plan adding $600 million to United Technologies' debt, "strong internal cash-flow generation for the rest of the year and management actions to reduce debt will allow" United Technologies to handle the transaction "without any material increase in debt leverage or deterioration in cashflow protection," the ratings concern said.
