Last year, the House approved the catastrophic-health program by a vote of 328 to 72.
Yesterday, the House vote was roughly the same, 360 to 66, to repeal it.
If the Senate concurs, as is likely, it will be the first time in decades that a welfare-state program has been simply zeroed out.
The demise of federal catastrophic care has also killed for now any further attempts to socialize American medicine.
This gives the Bush administration a real chance to propose an agenda to reform America's cartelized health-care industry that is more in line with the country's free-market instincts.
