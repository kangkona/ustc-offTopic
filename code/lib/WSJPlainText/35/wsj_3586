Major U.K. retailer Sears PLC reported lower pretax profits than at last year's interim stage, as difficult trading conditions, brought on by high interest rates and rising wage settlements, cut into revenue. 

As a result, Chairman Geoffrey Maitland Smith said the company is shifting the emphasis of its activities to reduce its exposure in mature markets, while accelerating development in high-growth areas. 

"It is a tough program, but we are going to emerge even stronger," the chairman promised. 

Sears bears no business relationship to the U.S. company of the same name. 

In the six months ended July 31, profit before tax slipped about 10% to #91.7 million ($147 million) from #102.3 million in the year-earlier period, slightly bettering market expectations between #80 million and #87 million.
