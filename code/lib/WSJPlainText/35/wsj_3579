Topps Co. split its shares 3 for 2, payable Nov. 15 to stock of record Oct. 18. 

The baseball card and bubble gum maker also declared a six-cent-a-share dividend on the post-split stock, with the same payment and record dates.
The new dividend is a nearly 13% increase in the quarterly dividend; Topps had been paying out eight cents a share.
The split will boost shares outstanding to about 31.5 million from 21 million. 

In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Topps shares rose 75 cents to $26. 

The board took the actions "to broaden the base of stockholders and bring the {stock} price to a point where it is more accessible," a spokesman said.
