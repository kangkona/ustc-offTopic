Marrow-Tech Inc., Elmsford, N.Y., said it will collaborate with American Cyanamid Co. on an implantable wound treatment product for burn victims. 

Marrow-Tech said it has a proprietary technology to make implantable living tissue and has been using a biodegradable mesh made by American Cyanamid's medical division as a foundation for the tissue.
The dermal equivalent can be stored frozen and potentially used for immediate treatment of wounds at burn centers. 

Marrow-Tech said it has been experimenting with this tissue on animals and will expand the preclinical trials on large burns on animals in collaboration with American Cyanamid.
