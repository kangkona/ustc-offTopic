Snacking may not be so bad after all. 

A recent study shows that eating many small meals during the day, instead of three large ones, can significantly lower blood cholesterol levels -- a finding that may help cut the risk of heart attacks. 

The study, by researchers associated with St. Michael's Hospital and the University of Toronto, found that men who ate 17 snacks a day spaced at hourly intervals for two weeks had cholesterol levels 8.5% lower than after two weeks of eating the same amount and type of food in three big meals a day.
The study, which involved seven men, also found that the so-called nibbling diet reduced two dangerous subtypes of cholesterol by 13.5% and 15%. 

The study is the strongest evidence to date that people who eat many small meals spread throughout the day can reduce risk factors associated with heart disease.
Previous studies had found that people who reduced meal frequency actually increased cholesterol level, but that was because the few meals they ate tended to be substantially larger than normal. 

The new study attempted to test the idea that it mattered whether identical diets were consumed in three meals or in a series of small but frequent snacks.
The researchers said the study, published in today's New England Journal of Medicine, was designed to discover if any dietary maneuvers can influence cholesterol. 

"We conclude that in addition to the amount and type of food eaten, the frequency of meals may be an important determinant" of cholesterol levels in the blood, the authors wrote. 

The researchers suggested that frequent meals lowered the amount of cholesterol produced by the body's liver.
The researchers found that when the men snacked their bodies made less insulin, a substance produced by the body to absorb dietary sugars in food.
Other research has found that high levels of insulin increases cholesterol production, the researchers said.
