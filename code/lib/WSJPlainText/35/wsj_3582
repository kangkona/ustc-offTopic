The stock market withstood a late flurry of profit-taking to establish a new set of record highs in active trading, marked by a shift toward the battered technology sector. 

Paced by a surge in USX, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 16.53 to 2771.09, its second consecutive all-time high.
So far this week, the 30-stock average has climbed a total of 78.27 points, or 2.9%. 

Prices drifted through the first half of the session as traders expressed uncertainty about the market's ability to hold its gains during the two previous sessions.
By midday, however, the market was on the upswing again. 

Two rounds of futures-related buy programs in the early afternoon pushed prices to session highs, but the market then began a pullback that gained momentum as the final hour of trading got under way. 

The industrial average, which peaked with a gain of about 22 points, gave back nearly all of the advance before program buying resulting from stock-index arbitrage resurfaced at about 3:30 p.m. EDT.
The market quickly rallied as players sold index-futures contracts and purchased stocks to lock in profits.

About 5% of the latest total resulted from the unusually brisk activity in USX, which advanced 2 1/2 to 38 3/4 amid reports that investor Carl Icahn is adding to his 11.4% stake.

In the latest session, Big Board composite volume in USX totaled 12.7 million shares. 

Well-received forecasts of quarterly results from Microsoft and Sun Microsystems, both of which rose sharply in heavy trading on the over-the-counter market, acted as a catalyst for the rebound in technology stocks. 

Michael Sherman, senior investment strategist at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said the sell-off in those issues following International Business Machines' forecasts that third-quarter earnings would be short of estimates made them more attractive to institutions. "They would like to buy some stocks that have a little bit less air under them," he said.
