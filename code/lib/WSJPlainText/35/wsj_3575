Medstone International Inc. said it expects to report a third-quarter loss, chiefly from its "non-compliance" in submitting required data to the Food and Drug Administration for a device it makes for treating kidney stones. 

The Irvine, Calif., company didn't specify how large the loss would be, and officers of the company couldn't be reached to comment further.
In the year-earlier third quarter, the company reported net income of $2.6 million, or 52 cents a share, on revenue of $8.4 million. 

In August, Medstone disclosed that it had informed the FDA of its "non-compliance" in submitting required reports and meeting certain technical standards for the X-ray imaging system used in its shockwave lithotripter, a device for treating kidney stones.
Medstone said the FDA informed the company earlier this week that it had accepted the company's "corrective plan" on data submitted.
But it said it had suspended sales of the kidney stones device pending the FDA announcement. 

The company said it would now resume shipments of the device.
