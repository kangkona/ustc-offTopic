U.S. investors purchased a record net $4.4 billion of foreign securities in the second quarter, more than in any previous full year, the Securities Industry Association said. 

The full-year record was $3.9 billion in 1985, said the SIA, the securities industry's trade association.
In the first quarter of 1989, U.S. investors purchased a net $1.7 billion of foreign securities, the SIA said. 

David Strongin, SIA's director of international finance, said the record reflects the fact that foreign stock markets, led by the Japanese market, have recovered faster from the October 1987 crash than have U.S. markets. "U.S. investors didn't want to be left behind," Mr. Strongin said. 

With U.S. stock markets now performing better, Mr. Strongin added, the SIA doesn't expect the massive amount of foreign purchases by U.S. investors to continue much longer. 

The SIA also said foreign activity in U.S. stock markets gained sharply in the second quarter.
Foreign investors bought and sold more than $107 billion of U.S. equities in the second quarter, the association said, marking the first time since the 1987 fourth quarter that activity topped $100 billion.
Activity in that quarter topped $122 billion. 

Net purchases of U.S. stocks by foreign investors rose to $4.5 billion, compared with $400 million in the first quarter.
Japanese investors accounted for $1.9 billion of net purchases. 

Almost $3.6 billion of net purchases were made in June alone, the SIA added.
