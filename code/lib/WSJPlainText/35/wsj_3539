New Jersey seized control of Jersey City's school system, making it the first district to be completely taken over by a state for failing to meet minimum educational standards. 

At least seven other states have similar takeover laws, although New Jersey's is the most far-reaching.
The state will now be responsible for all spending, hiring, administrative and curriculum decisions for Jersey City, which has 28,083 students, a staff of 3,322 and a $180 million budget. 

The order ends more than 18 months of legal battles between the state and Jersey City which fought bitterly to retain local control.
The state now has five years to correct the problems in Jersey City. 

Now that a state school district has been created, Jersey City's local board of education is abolished and the school superintendent as well as several other top administrators were ousted.
The state will appoint an advisory school board within the next two months. 

The problems in Jersey City are "severe longstanding, deep-rooted deficiencies permeating all aspects of the school system," the State Board of Education said in announcing its decision.
