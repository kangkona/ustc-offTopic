Michael Foods Inc. said slower-than-anticipated sales of its ultra-pasteurized liquid egg product will lower earnings for the rest of the year. 

The projection sent its stock plummeting. 

The company said it now expects third-quarter earnings to decline from last year's 34 cents a share, and that full-year results will fall from the $1.20 a share posted for 1988.
One analyst, Ronald L. Strauss of William Blair & Co., said he is estimating per-share profit of $1 for this year and $1.15 for next. 

As a result of the projections, Michael Foods stock was hit with a wave of selling.
It fell $3.25 to close at $14.125 in heavy national over-the-counter trading.
More than 950,000 shares, or about 8% of the stock outstanding, exchanged hands. 

The company said that despite slower sales of its Easy Eggs product, it remained confident in the eventual success of the product. 

Prospects for a whole-egg product with a long shelf life had attracted speculators to the stock.
Many believed that fast-food chains, concerned about spoilage, would be a receptive market for Easy Eggs, but so far that hasn't been the case. 

Earlier this year Michael Foods said it had commitments for virtually all of the 25 million pounds of Easy Eggs capacity at its North Carolina plant, and was completing a Minnesota facility that would add another 200 million pounds of capacity.
At the time the company said the new plant "allows us to immediately meet significant additional demand by major food-service customers." 

"They have irreparably damaged their credibility and it will take a long time to rebuild," said L. Craig Carver, a food analyst at Dain, Bosworth & Co. in Minneapolis. "The company's bottom line was that demand was not an issue, that capacity was the only issue.
Now we're finding it is just the opposite."
