Ferranti International Signal PLC said an independent audit confirmed the British company's own findings that it was the victim of fraud on contracts involving a U.S. subsidiary. 

A report submitted this week by accountants Coopers & Lybrand disclosed "no information which would lead {the auditors} to suspect that the Ferranti International balance sheet exposure to fraud was any different" from what Ferranti detailed last week, the company said. 

Last Friday, Ferranti Chairman Derek Alun-Jones said the company would have to reduce its net asset value by about #185 million ($297 million) to offset losses related to fraud involving its Lancaster, Pa.-based International Signal and Controls Ltd. unit.
