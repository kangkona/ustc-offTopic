Colin C. Blaydon, dean of the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration at Dartmouth College, said he will resign at the end of the 1989-90 academic year and take a one-year sabbatical leave beginning in July 1990. 

Mr. Blaydon served as dean for seven years.
School officials said a new dean hasn't been named. 

During Mr. Blaydon's term, the school increased its number of faculty members by one-third to 53 and doubled the number of international students in attendance to 66.
Dartmouth, with 330 students enrolled, is the smallest of the top 20 U.S. business schools, a Dartmouth spokesman said. 

Mr. Blaydon hasn't announced plans for after his sabbatical.
