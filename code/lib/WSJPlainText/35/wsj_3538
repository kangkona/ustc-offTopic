Pacific Enterprises named its president, James R. Ukropina, as chairman and chief executive, succeeding Paul A. Miller and ending a century of family leadership at the utility holding company. 

Mr. Ukropina, 52 years old, joined the company in 1984 and was named president and a director in 1986.
Succeeding him as president is Willis B. Wood, currently executive vice president, who also was elected a director.
Mr. Wood is 55. 

Mr. Miller, who will retire when he turns 65 at the end of this month, is the grandson of C.O.G. Miller, who founded the Pacific Enterprises' predecessor company, Pacific Lighting Corp., in 1886. 

The founder's son, Robert W. Miller, and his son, Paul, continued the expansion of Pacific Enterprises into a $5.9 billion concern that operates Southern California Gas Co., Thrifty Corp., a chain of drug and sporting goods stores, and Pacific Enterprises Oil Co. 

Pacific Enterprises stock rose $1.75 to $57.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, although analysts said the management changes were expected. 

Analysts said the naming of Mr. Ukropina represented a conservative move by an unusually conservative utility concern.
Unlike some companies, Pacific Enterprises has "made no major errors moving outside their area of expertise," said Craig Schwerdt, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. 

"Each of the company's businesses are positioned to do well in the coming year," said Paul Milbauer, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell in New York.
Most of the company's retail operations are in the fast-growing West, and the gas unit will benefit from tightening environmental regulations, he said.
He added that more-stringent pollution controls are expected to increase demand for gas, which is relatively clean-burning. 

In the six months ended June 30, Pacific Enterprises' net income rose 3.5% to $120 million, or $1.80 a share, on a 22% increase in revenue to $3.4 billion.
