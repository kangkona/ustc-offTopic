Tokyo stock prices struggled against pessimism and caution as the Nikkei Index managed a narrow gain, ending a three-day losing streak. 

In London, on the other hand, share prices ended at intraday lows.
Wall Street's rise to a record close Tuesday and its strong opening yesterday were outweighed by continued weakness in the pound, which sharpened fears that U.K. interest rates might soon rise. 

The Tokyo market opened lower and reflected a tug of war between positive and negative elements through the day, dealers said.
Trading was fairly active, and selective buying orders eventually pushed the 225-stock index barely into the plus column, traders said. 

The index, which fell 256.60 points Tuesday, rose 16.43 to 35382.80.
Volume on the first section was estimated at 850 million shares, compared with 800 million Tuesday.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 532-439, with 162 unchanged.
The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues in the first section, which lost 14.78 points Tuesday, was down 9.40, or 0.35%, at 

In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index rose 58.70 points to 35441.50. 

Some investors, especially major institutions, avoided active trading ahead of today's West German Bundesbank council meeting and tomorrow's release of U.S. September employment data, traders said Wednesday.
But some said a prospective interest rate increase by the Bundesbank is already reflected in current dollar rates, so an announcement of a rate rise today might have little effect. 

"The focus of our attention is how far central banks will battle against persistent demand for the dollar through interventions," a trader at Wako Securities said. 

Investor interest yesterday centered on companies whose share prices are low in relation to their property holdings. 

One notable winner was Mitsubishi Steel Manufacturing, which was up 200 yen to 2,680 yen ($18.97) a share.
The company said it will move its Tokyo plant to Japan's Hokkaido island within three years and use the Tokyo land for office buildings. 

Sapporo Breweries gained 50 to 1,800, largely on the strength of its property holdings in central Tokyo, traders said.
Other issues that were up on property factors included Kikkoman, which rose 80 to 1,780, and Shochiku, up 190 to 3,930 yen. 

Retail issues rebounded from Tuesday's losses as lower prices lured investors back.
Rumors that a large real estate concern was buying shares of department stores and supermarkets also brought buying orders back into the sector, traders said.
Isetan was up 300 to 5,050, Maruzen gained 180 to 1,710, and Daiei rose 50 to 3,150. 

Other gainers included chemical issues. 

Nippon Carbide rose 56 to 979, Kyowa Hakko Kogyo gained 30 to 1,770, and Toagosei Chemical advanced 80 to 1,210. 

Steel issues fell as some institutions dumped them to reduce stakes acquired early this year when prices were rising. 

Kawasaki Steel dropped 29 to 776, NKK fell 23 to 710, and Nippon Steel was down 16 at 735. 

Hitachi and Toshiba were sold after a local news report said the companies will reduce prices on their next generation of advanced semiconductor chips to compete for more market share.
Some investors thought such a move might rebound against Toshiba and Hitachi because some competitors also are contemplating price cuts, traders said.
Hitachi was down 40 to 1,490, and Toshiba lost 50 to 1,140. 

London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 6.5 points lower at 2312.1, down sharply from an intraday high of 2331.1.
The Financial Times 30-share index fell 9.1 to 1890.2.
Turnover expanded to 472.1 million shares from 403.8 million Tuesday.
But investor interest, which blossomed in early trading, "dried up almost completely in the afternoon," one trader said. 

After a strong opening, the market tumbled as sterling came under renewed pressure, prompting repeated intervention by the Bank of England. 

A trader described the market as "on a knife's edge" awaiting results of today's meeting of the Bundesbank central bank council.
An increase in West German interest rates would put pressure on U.K. rates to follow suit. 

Dealers said most activity occurred in a few shares involved in special situations, while most issues marked time in dull trading. 

STC, a computer and telecommunications group, fell 13 pence to 329 pence ($5.28) a share.
News that the company's chief executive officer had sold half a million shares triggered investor selling amid rumors that STC may have purchased a sizable stake in beleaguered electronics group Ferranti International. 

However, Ferranti firmed 2 1/2 to 57 1/2 on heavy volume of 38 million shares, thanks to speculation that the company is a prime takeover target.
Ferranti said an independent audit confirmed the company's finding that it was the victim of fraud on contracts involving a subsidiary, International Signal & Control, Lancaster, Pa. 

Grand Metropolitan was 6 higher at 604 on talk that financier Sir James Goldsmith is interested in buying the brewing interests of the leisure, food and drinks giant. 

Pearson gained 12 to 738 as rumors circulated that U.K. brokerage house Kleinwort Benson is about to raise its profit projections for the publishing concern. 

Enterprise Oil fell 6 to 593.
Several stocks gained on what traders described as a technical rebound from recent weakness.
Among them, Reuters advanced 6 to 940, B.A.T rose 13 to 846, and Standard Chartered gained 4 to 535. 

Other European markets better reflected Wall Street's bullishness, as prices rose in Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Milan.
South African gold stocks closed narrowly mixed. 

Elsewhere, shares closed higher in Hong Kong, Singapore, Wellington and Manila, were lower in Seoul and Taipei and were little changed in Sydney. 

Trading in Taipei was marked by a return to pessimism as Tuesday's market rebound proved to be a one-day phenomenon.
Its Weighted Index closed at 9669.94, down 374.02, its largest one-day decline since June 26. 

Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.
