Catalina Lighting Inc. said it signed a two-year, $40 million secured revolving line of credit with Irving Trust Co., a Bank of New York Co. unit. 

The company, which designs and distributes lighting fixtures and other products, said that Citizens Fidelity Bank & Trust Co. and Lloyds Bank PLC also participated in establishing the credit line.
The company said the credit line increases Catalina's borrowing capacity by $10 million and provides the company with additional funding to meet anticipated growth during its new fiscal year, which began Sunday.
