In two weeks a group of Montreal investors will launch the first issue of Caribbean Week, a 40-page newspaper aimed at visitors to, and upscale residents and expatriates of the geographically scattered region. 

"In some ways we're attempting to be the USA Today of the Caribbean," publisher Tim Forsythe said from Bridgetown, Barbados, where the weekly newspaper will be edited and printed. 

Mr. Forsythe, until he moved to Bridgetown, was general manager of This Week In Business, a Montreal business weekly.
He said he and two friends began working on the idea of publishing a regional Caribbean newspaper two years ago.
His two friends remain in Montreal, handling advertising sales and promotion. 

Mr. Forsythe and editor Gary Steckles, formerly editor of the Sunday edition of the Montreal Gazette, head a staff of 10, supplemented by about 20 freelancers.
The newspaper will be printed in Bridgetown and distributed by air.
The cover price is $1 (U.S.) or about its equivalent in each of the many currencies used in the area. 

Mr. Forsythe said that while some Caribbean islands are well-served by local newspapers and U.S. newspapers and magazines are available on the larger islands, Caribbean Week will be the first publication to treat the area as a single region. 

Mr. Forsythe said one-third of the 60,000 copies printed will be distributed outside the Caribbean to cities with a large expatriate population, as well as to airlines and cruise lines.
