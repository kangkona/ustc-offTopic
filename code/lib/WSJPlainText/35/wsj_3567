Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, Belgium's second largest holding company, said 1989 first-half consolidated group earnings rose 5.7% to 5.758 billion Belgian francs ($145.3 million) from 5.448 billion francs in the same period a year earlier. 

Per-share earnings were 306 francs, it said, down from 311 francs a year earlier.
Per-share earnings were diluted during the latest first half as the group issued new shares to finance increases in its stakes in Belgian oil company Petrofina and utility holding company Tractebel. 

On a non-consolidated basis, it said earnings fell 2.6% to 2.746 billion francs from 2.818 billion francs.
Consolidated income performed better mainly because of higher contributions by companies in which GBL has equity stakes. 

GBL, the largest holder in U.S. investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert, with a 26% stake, said that "despite the dreary climate of Wall Street, {Drexel's} June 30 results were positive." Drexel Burnham was at the center of investigations by U.S. authorities on insider trading and made huge payments as part of a settlement.
