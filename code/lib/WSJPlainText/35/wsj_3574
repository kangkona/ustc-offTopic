Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Ill., said the Food and Drug Administration approved "treatment investigational new drug" status for Survanta, a drug intended to prevent and treat certain respiratory difficulties in newborn infants. 

A "treatment IND" permits non-research use of experimental drugs that have been designated as potentially lifesaving during the period in which clinical trial results are being prepared for submission and review. 

Under the FDA's action, Survanta will be made available at no cost to hospitals with neonatal intensive care units that have personnel experienced in treating infants with the ailment known as respiratory distress syndrome. 

Abbott licenses the drug from Survanta Tokyo Tanabe Co., said an Abbott spokeswoman, and the drug is currently sold in powder form in Japan.
