Chevron Corp., San Francisco, said it moved closer to a long-considered $1 billion renovation at its Richmond, Calif., oil refinery. 

The oil company said it filed for environmental and other permits for new construction at the 315,000 barrel-per-day facility, which started operations in 1902. 

The proposed renovation and modernization would include a so-called flexicoker unit that will enhance capacity to process heavier and more sulphurous oils, as well as a new crude oil distillation unit and facilities to reprocess the refinery's energy. 

The additions wouldn't increase the amount of crude oil that can be processed by the refinery, a company spokesman said, but are designed to improve efficiency and the value of products produced.
The renovations would also reduce polluting air and water emissions. 

Flexicokers extract more high-value distillates such as gasoline from heavy oils that otherwise produce larger proportions of heavier distillates and low-value coke. 

Applications are being made to a range of state and local authorities and initial designs undertaken in what is called an initial phase to cost about $20 million.
