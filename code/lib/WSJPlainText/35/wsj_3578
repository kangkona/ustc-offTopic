Medical Care International Inc. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire MediVision Inc. for cash and stock valued at $45 million. 

Dallas-based Medical Care said it would issue about 1.8 million shares of stock and pay about $9 million in cash for the owner and operator of ophthalmic surgical facilities and clinics.
In 1988, MediVision, based in Boston, had operating profit of $6.7 million on revenue of $50 million. 

Medical Care, which owns outpatient surgical centers, said it expects to complete the transaction by year's end.
