The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. toughened its eligibility standards for lenders that sell mortgages to it. 

Freddie Mac raised the net worth requirement to $1 million from $250,000, effective immediately.
Lenders with net worth below the new standard that already are doing business with Freddie Mac will have to increase their net worth, or assets minus liabilities, in stages during the next three years. 

Freddie Mac, a government-sponsored, shareholder-owned corporation operates a secondary market for mortgage loans, buying loans from lenders and packaging them into securities for sale to investors.
The company said the changes were designed, in part, to comply with the recent thrift-bailout law. 

Under the new guidelines, lenders who sell loans to Freddie Mac or service loans for the corporation will be required to maintain a minimum servicing portfolio of $10 million.
Current servicers will have a year to comply with the new requirements.
