West Germany's unemployment rate fell to 7.3% in September from 7.5% in August, the Federal Labor Office said. 

It was the country's lowest level for unemployment since July 1982, when unemployment was 7.2%.
The drop in unemployment to 1,880,776 in September was in line with expectations. 

The Labor Office also said a second category of unemployment, which includes all civilian employees and independently employed persons as well as helpers, fell to 6.6% from 6.8% in August.
The Labor Office introduced the second category in August.
The number of unemployed remains unchanged in the second category, but has a broader base of those termed employed to include independently employed. 

Heinrich Franke, president of the Labor Office, said the unemployment level in September was 10% or 219,100 below year-earlier levels.
He said the supply of workers grew sharply in September because of the inflow of immigrants from East Germany as well as from Eastern Europe. 

He said that thanks to the country's continued strong economy the extra supply of workers wasn't only absorbed into the economy, but the unemployment level continued to sink as well.
