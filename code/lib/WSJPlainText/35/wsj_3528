We at the Mars Project are, of course, delighted that you reported on NASA's decision to study intensively the anomalies in the Cydonia region of Mars with the Mars Observer spacecraft (Sept. 14).
Your article was complete and balanced.
But the headline -- "One Thing We Know Right Now Is Just Who's Going To Pay for It" -- was inappropriate. 

It's not just that the headline had nothing to do with the story.
NASA's decision to image the Cydonia region simply has no budgetary impact.
This decision concerns only what will be imaged by the onboard Malin camera.
That has significant scientific implications, to be sure, but it will not raise the cost of the mission one dime. 

Scientists think the Cydonia region is rich in interesting features, quite apart from the anomalies that concern us.
No matter what is discovered about the anomalies, the imaging time will not be wasted.
