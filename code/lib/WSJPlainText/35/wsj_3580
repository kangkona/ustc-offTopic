The parent of the Dallas Times Herald said it asked the Federal Communications Commission to revoke A.H. Belo Corp. 's Dallas television license, charging that Belo has taken anticompetitive actions in Dallas. 

Belo, which owns the Dallas Morning News, recently signed a joint TV-production venture with Universal Press Syndicate that also called for Universal to move 26 features to the Morning News from the Times Herald, the city's No. 2 newspaper.
The Morning News agreed to pay $1 million over five years for the features, which included Dear Abby, "Doonesbury" and the "Far Side." 

Belo and Universal have said they plan to develop TV programs and TV advertising for medium-sized newspapers based on Universal's features.
But the Times Herald claims the venture is a "sham," intended to mask Belo's effort to eliminate its newspaper competition. 

The Times Herald has sued the Morning News in Houston, charging antitrust-law violations and interference with a contract.
Belo also owns WFAA-TV in Dallas and other TV stations. 

In its petition with the FCC, the Times Herald Printing Co. charged Belo had damaged "fair competition" in the Dallas newspaper market and used its newspaper and TV muscle to engage in anticompetitive conduct.
The Times Herald asked the commission to order Belo to show why the FCC shouldn't revoke WFAA's license or require Belo to sell the station. 

A Belo spokesman said that questions about its conduct are the subject of a court proceeding and "we fully expect to be vindicated at the trial of the case." He said it "would be inappropriate" to comment further.
Belo has 30 days to respond to the Times Herald petition to the FCC.
