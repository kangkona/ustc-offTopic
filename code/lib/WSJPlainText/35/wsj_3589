Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded debt ratings of Texas Air Corp. and its Continental Airlines unit because of the bankruptcy-law case of another unit, Eastern Airlines. 

Moody's said there is a possibility that Texas Air could be drawn further into the Eastern bankruptcy-law case.
Also, it said, the problems at Eastern make it difficult for Texas Air to support Continental.
The ratings downgrades "reflect the high leverage, weak debt protection and decreasing financial flexibility of the parent and its subsidiaries," Moody's said. 

About $1.9 billion of debt is affected, but that includes ratings assigned to new issues and one issue that was upgraded. 

A Texas Air spokesman declined to comment specifically on the Moody's downgrade, but pointed out that competitor Standard & Poor's Corp. took Texas Air off its CreditWatch list of ratings under review this week. "We believe that Standard & Poor's is fully informed of recent developments surrounding the company and that they correctly assess the situation," he said. 

Moody's had placed almost all Texas Air's debt ratings, and those of its units, under review for a possible downgrade March 9, the day Eastern filed for bankruptcy-law protection. 

Texas Air's senior unsecured debt was lowered to Caa from single-B-3, while three classes of Continental debt also dropped.
Those were senior secured debt to single-B-2 from single-B-1, senior unsecured debt to single-B-3 from single-B-2, and subordinated debentures to Caa from single-B-3. 

Moody's upgraded People Express secured equipment certificates to single-B-2 from single-B-3, and senior notes to single-B-3 from Caa. 

Moody's also assigned a single-B-3 rating to Continental's proposed offering of $208 million of senior notes, and assigned a single-B-2 rating to Continental's proposed offering of $95.2 million of secured equipment certificates.
