Nuclear Support Services Inc. said it expects to report a loss of as much as 30 cents a share for its fourth quarter, ended Saturday, which could cut full-year earnings to 41 cents a share. 

The announcement sent the stock tumbling $2.75 a share, or 23%, to close at $9.125 in national over-the-counter trading after a temporary trading halt. 

There is also the potential for a "slight loss" in the first quarter of fiscal 1990, the company's president and chief executive officer, Laurence M. Strassner, said.
He blamed the losses on higher-than-expected costs related to a merger of two subsidiaries and a delay in introducing valve diagnostic equipment. 

The company, which provides maintenance services for nuclear power plants, had earnings of $303,000, or 14 cents a share, in the year-earlier fourth quarter.
A fourth-quarter loss of 30 cents a share would indicate net income of around $880,000, or 41 cents a share, for the year.
The company had a net loss of $566,866 on revenue of $56.4 million in fiscal 

Analyst Kerry Robertson of Chesapeake Securities Research in Towson, Md., said he had expected modest earnings for the company in the fourth quarter.
He said he expects its earnings to rebound quickly because the merger of the two subsidiaries is likely to reduce costs and increase sales. 

Mr. Strassner said the merger of the Henze Service and Movats Inc. subsidiaries will make Nuclear Support the only company in the industry able to provide both diagnostics and repair for motor-operated valves.
He also predicted that it will increase sales and said fiscal 1990 earnings should equal or surpass those of the year just ended.
