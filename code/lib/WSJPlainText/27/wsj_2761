Motorola Inc., its third-quarter earnings crimped by a stiff one-time charge, said net income rose 3% despite a 20% increase in sales. 

The Schaumburg, Ill., maker of electronic equipment and semiconductor chips said net rose to $89 million, or 69 cents a share, from the year-earlier $87 million, or 67 cents a share. 

Earnings were hurt by a $43 million pretax charge to cover expenses associated with a planned staff-reduction effort.
The impact of that charge was partly offset by substantially lower taxes for the third quarter, reflecting a decrease in the company's estimated annual tax rate. 

Sales climbed to $2.41 billion from $2.01 billion. 

In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Motorola shares dropped $2 to close at $59.375, on heavy trading volume. 

Motorola's results were paced by a 97% sales increase in its general systems group, which includes its fast-growing cellular systems operation.
