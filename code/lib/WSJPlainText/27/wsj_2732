Allegheny International Inc. filed two new reorganization proposals yesterday, including a plan jointly sponsored by its banks. 

The troubled consumer products concern, which has been operating with protection from creditors' lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code since February 1988, evidently decided to file two plans, knowing that its primary plan wouldn't be backed by major creditors. 

Indeed, the primary plan is substantially similar to an earlier plan proposed in August, which was opposed by the company's senior unsecured creditors and equity holders.
Allegheny said if the primary plan isn't confirmed by Jan. 22, it plans to withdraw it. 

The alternative plan, which is backed by the banks, provides for a sizable cash payment to Allegheny's secured bank group.
The remainder of the banks' claims would be paid in stock, and effectively give the banks control of the company, leaving the remainder to other creditor and equity groups. 

The alternative plan also settles litigation against the banks.
Allegheny's unsecured creditors already have said they oppose the alternative plan, and it is unlikely that the equity group, which would receive only 2.5% of common stock and 2.5% of a new preferred stock, would back it either. 

A hearing on the two plans is scheduled for Nov. 9.
