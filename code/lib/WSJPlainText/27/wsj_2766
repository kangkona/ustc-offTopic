Todd Shipyards Corp. said an audit by the U.S. Defense Contract Audit Agency questions $87.4 million of $298.8 million of labor costs claimed by Todd and its subsidiary, Todd Pacific Shipyards Corp., for Todd's fiscal years 1979 through 1988. 

Todd officials didn't explain why the audit agency questioned the labor costs, and weren't available for additional comment. 

The company is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection. 

Todd said in Seattle that it can't predict the outcome of the audit, prepared for the U.S. Naval Sea Systems Command.
Todd said it plans to begin settlement talks with the Navy by the end of the month, but warned that an adverse finding by the Navy could reduce the amount of receivables carried by Todd on its balance sheet. 

The company also announced that the bankruptcy court for the district of New Jersey approved its plan to sell its subsidiary, Aro Corp., and set a Nov. 16 deadline for bids for Aro.
