A group of investors said it raised its stake in Healthco International to 9.7% of the common shares outstanding. 

In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group, which includes Cramer Rosenthal McGlynn Inc. and N-W Group Inc., said it now holds 750,827 Healthco common shares, including 115,000 shares purchased from Sept. 18 to Oct. 4 for $18.125 each. 

In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Healthco closed at $17.25, down 50 cents. 

No reason was given for the increased stake, but a previous filing said the group had purchased shares as an investment. 

Cramer Rosenthal McGlynn is a New York City-based investment advisement firm and N-W Group is a Phoenix, Ariz.-based real estate firm. 

Officials of Healthco, a Boston-based maker of dental equipment, couldn't be reached for comment.
