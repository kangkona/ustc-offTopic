Nynex Corp. unions rejected the company's latest contract offer to settle the two-month strike and formally broke off negotiations yesterday. 

A spokesman for the company said the latest offer reduced the weekly amount each union member would pay for health insurance premiums and increased the wage package. "We're extremely displeased," he said. "We thought the offer addressed issues raised by the unions." 

The Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers have vehemently opposed any payment by employees for health care.
A spokesman for the CWA in New York said that the union hasn't changed its position.
Talks might end up in mediation, but there is no formal step in that direction." 

About 60,000 Nynex employees -- about 40,000 CWA members and about 20,000 IBEW members -- are on strike in New York and New England.
