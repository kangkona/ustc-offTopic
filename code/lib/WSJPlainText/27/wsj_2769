Widespread selling continued on the over-the-counter stock market, but a late round of buying by "bottom-fishers" cushioned the Nasdaq composite index's fall. 

The composite, which at one point was off 0.7%, slipped 1.98 points to 482.16.
The 0.4% decline matched the drop by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but was less than the 0.6% slide by the New York Stock Exchange composite index. 

In the OTC market there were 1,230 declining issues, and only 749 advancing.
Trading in stocks that lost ground accounted for about 42% of Nasdaq volume, which totaled 133 million shares. 

Traders said semiconductor issues were the focus of much of the early selling as investors responded to the news that the industry's bellwether ratio of new orders to shipments slipped in September to its lowest level since 1985.
The ratio's decline reflected inventory cutbacks, falling chip prices and generally sluggish electronics markets, industry analysts said. 

But Gary Rosenbach, manager of equity trading at Needham & Co., which makes markets in semiconductor and other technology-related issues, said the group "rebounded nicely" by the end of trading.
He said many analysts and investors say conditions in the industry are improving. 

Leading semiconductor stock Intel, which finished Tuesday at 34, dropped as low as 33 during yesterday's trading, but recovered somewhat to close at 33 5/8, off 3/8, on volume of 1.4 million shares.
The stock of Applied Materials, which supplies equipment to semiconductor makers, tumbled to 28 1/2 during the day, but finished off 1/2 at 28 3/4. 

Lance Zipper, head of OTC trading at Kidder, Peabody & Co., said opportunistic investors entered the market and began selectively buying OTC stocks that lost ground yesterday and Tuesday.
But, he believes the market still "has a little more correcting to do." 

Among other active stocks, MCI Communications, which has filed suit against American Telephone & Telegraph alleging that some of its ads are false and misleading, lost 1 1/4 to 45 1/8 on 2.4 million shares.
MCI declined 1 3/8 on Tuesday. 

Laidlaw Transportation Class B shares eased 1/8 to 19 3/8 on volume of 1.4 million shares, and Jaguar's American depositary receipts rose 1/8 to 10 1/8 on volume of three million.
Great American Communication, the most active issue, finished unchanged at 12 on 4.8 million shares.
The company is a broadcasting concern. 

Apple Computer dropped 5/8 to 48 7/8, and Oracle Systems was off 3/8 to 25 1/8.
The weakness in those and other big technology issues dragged down the Nasdaq 100 index of large non-financial stocks, which lost 2.0 to 470.17. 

Big financial issues lost ground, too.
Midlantic fell 3/4 to 46 1/8, CoreStates Financial lost 1/8 to 46 1/2, St. Paul Cos. eased 1/4 to 60 1/2, and First Executive was off 1/8 to 12 1/4.
The Nasdaq financial index fell 2.01 to 473.07. 

Qintex tumbled 1 5/8 to 4 on 513,000 shares.
The Australian concern's pact to acquire MGM/UA Communications for $1.5 billion was terminated by the U.S. entertainment company.
MGM/UA said it also filed suit against Qintex, charging it with breach of contract and fraud. 

McGill Manufacturing rose 14 1/2 to 72 1/2.
The U.S. unit of Sweden's SKF AB launched a $72-a-share tender offer, topping an earlier bid of $62 a share from BroadBeach Associates, which McGill rejected. 

Amgen gained 2 to 49 3/4.
Prudential-Bache raised its rating on the biotechnology stock, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. 

McCaw Cellular Communications, which has offered to pay $125 a share for 22 million shares of LIN Broadcasting as part of its attempted takeover, rose 1 to 43.
LIN, meanwhile, slipped 3/8 to 112 7/8. 

Separately, the National Association of Securities Dealers said the Tokyo Stock Exchange will now accept applications from the largest two-thirds of Nasdaq-traded stocks for trading.
But, the stocks must meet the exchange's foreign-stock listing requirements. 

Tokyo exchange officials said they decided to consider listing requests from the Nasdaq stocks because the National Market System, home to the big issues, is "a highly organized market with a regulatory framework that is as solid as those of the U.S. stock exchanges." 

Joseph Hardiman, NASD president, said stock listings on the Tokyo market will give the U.S. companies "improved access to capital from that part of the world."
