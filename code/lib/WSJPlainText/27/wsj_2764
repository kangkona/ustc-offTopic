M/A-Com Inc., Burlington, Mass., said it expects to report a loss of $5.5 million to $6.5 million for the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30. 

The maker of electronic parts for the defense market cited program costs, lower-than-expected sales in the fourth quarter and a restructuring charge of about $1.5 million. 

In the year-ago quarter, the company earned $4.7 million, or 18 cents a share, on sales of $102.9 million. 

The company estimated earnings for fiscal 1989 to be five cents to nine cents a share.
In fiscal 1988, profit was $18.4 million, or 65 cents a share, on sales of $424.2 million.
Year-earlier results for the quarter and year included a pretax gain of $2.3 million from the sale of assets. 

John J. Lynch, acting chief executive officer, said flat defense spending, defense industry competition and other factors lowered earnings in fiscal 1989 and will continue to hurt results during the first half of fiscal 1990.
He added, however, that "noticeable improvement" is expected in the second half of the current fiscal year.
