Continental Corp. raised the estimate of its third-quarter losses resulting from Hurricane Hugo to $80 million from $50 million. 

The big New York property-casualty insurer said the revised estimate reflects new loss projections from the company's adjusters in storm-damaged areas of South Carolina, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
The initial loss projection was given two weeks ago, soon after the storm hit. 

Continental didn't say how the increased charge would affect third-quarter earnings, which it expects to report Nov. 8, although analysts expect the charge will result in a loss for the quarter. 

Continental stock rose 37.5 cents yesterday to close at $34.875 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
