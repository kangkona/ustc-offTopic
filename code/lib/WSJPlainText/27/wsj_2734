The planned $65 million sale of the Denver Nuggets basketball team to a group of black investors apparently fell through this week when the group failed to meet a deadline for financing. 

The transaction would have made Bertram Lee, 50 years old, and Peter Bynoe, 38, the first black principal owners of a major professional sports team.
In a statement Tuesday night, Nuggets owner Sidney Shlenker said he had let the sale contract expire. 

Messrs.
Lee and Bynoe wouldn't comment on published reports that said the sale was doomed because the principals didn't have sufficient cash of their own in the transaction.
In a prepared statement, the businessmen said they still expected the sale to go through "in the near future." 

"We thought we would be able to conclude the deal on Tuesday, but some documentation not yet completed prevented us from closing." 

A Nuggets official who requested anonymity said the deal was "not dead in the water, but perhaps a little sick." 

An investor close to Mr. Lee confirmed that Messrs.
Lee and Bynoe were set to put up between $3 million and $5 million of their own funds, adding that as recently as last week it seemed "they were within days of closing it." 

Another person familiar with the sale said, "They have most if not all of the financing and they're currently working on the documentation.
But the exclusivity period ended . . . leaving Mr. Shlenker to seek other purchasers, and there's at least one in the wings."
