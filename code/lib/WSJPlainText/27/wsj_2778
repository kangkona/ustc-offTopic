Standard & Poor's Corp. said it lowered to single-B-minus from double-B-plus its rating on the company's $57.5 million of 6.5% convertible subordinated debentures due 2011.
It said the downgrade reflects the Irvine, Calif., concern's "poor earnings outlook and diminished financial flexibility" caused by its inability to integrate recent acquisitions. "The acquisitions raised business risk, drastically shifting the business mix from mature vocational schools to more volatile computer-based corporate training." Near-term operating propects are weak, S&P said, citing merger expenses and large working capital expenses.
National Education has said its lenders would call $62 million in unsecured loans if the lenders decline to participate in a new secured credit line, and S&P said such difficulties could result in another downgrade.
National Education officials said they hadn't seen the S&P report and declined comment.
