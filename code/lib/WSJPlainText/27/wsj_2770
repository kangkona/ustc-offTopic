A Louisiana judge upheld a 1987 decision by state regulators prohibiting Gulf States Utilities Co. from passing on part of $1.4 billion in disputed nuclear-plant construction costs to Louisiana customers. 

The judge also reaffirmed the five-year rate-increase plan previously approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission.
That increase is based on the remainder of Gulf States' costs in the plant.
The utility's total investment in the River Bend plant, north of Baton Rouge, La., amounts to $3.1 billion, but regulators had disallowed many expenditures as imprudent. 

Gulf States, based in Beaumont, Texas, said it is "leaning toward an appeal" of the court ruling to the Louisiana Supreme Court. 

If the rejection of the costs stands, the utility could face a significant write-down, estimated by one Wall Street analyst at about $450 million after taxes.
The company said it isn't clear when or if any write-down will be taken. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Gulf States common stock closed at $12.125, down $2.125.
