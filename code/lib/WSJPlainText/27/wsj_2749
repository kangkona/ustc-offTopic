StatesWest Airlines, Phoenix, Ariz., said it proposed acquiring much-larger Mesa Airlines of Farmington, N.M. 

Terms weren't disclosed, but StatesWest, which has a 7.25% stake in Mesa currently, said it is willing to make a tender offer for Mesa's remaining common stock "at a substantial premium over recent market prices." 

A Mesa spokesman said its board would "review and consider" StatesWest's proposal. 

In over-the-counter trading, Mesa closed at $6.75, up 12.5 cents.
On that basis, the company's total market value is about $11.2 million.
StatesWest was quoted at 81.25 cents bid. 

StatesWest, which began operating three years ago, hasn't turned a profit.
The carrier flies four twin-engine turboprop aircraft between 10 cities in California, Arizona and Nevada. 

Mesa operates 20 twin-engine and two single-engine turboprops among 42 cities in New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming, Colorado and Texas.
