U.S. officials have begun extradition proceedings against a Washington lawyer whom British authorities have linked to illegal acts in connection with Guinness PLC's controversial takeover of Distillers Co. in 

The lawyer, Thomas Ward, was arrested here last week by U.S. agents in response to a request from the British government that he be extradited for trial, according to U.S. officials.
Mr. Ward, who is expected to contest extradition, was arraigned in federal court and released after posting bond. 

British authorities have alleged that Mr. Ward illegally received $9.8 million from Guinness, a British beer maker, after the acquisition of Distillers, a Scottish brewer.
The authorities apparently are investigating whether the payment to Mr. Ward, a former Guinness director, is linked to alleged manipulation of the company's share price at the time of the takeover.
Seven people, including former Guinness Chairman Ernest Saunders, are scheduled to go on trial in London in January on charges related to the takeover. 

British authorities apparently have linked Mr. Ward to a $100 million investment Guinness made in 1986 in a fund run by Ivan Boesky, the former Wall Street arbitrager convicted in this country for securities-law violations.
In exchange for the investment, Mr. Boesky allegedly assisted Guinness in its bid -- possibly by helping manipulate the price of the company's stock, which was used to buy Distillers. 

Mr. Ward and his lawyer declined to comment.
Mr. Ward has previously denied any wrongdoing.
In 1987, he returned to Guinness about $2 million of the disputed payment, which his lawyers have said was a legitimate fee for helping with the Distillers takeover.
