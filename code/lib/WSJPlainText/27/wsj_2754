Two Sony Corp. subsidiaries were charged in a lawsuit with violating Delaware law in connection with its $27-a-share, or $3.4 billion, tender offer for Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. 

The suit, filed in Delaware Chancery Court by a Columbia Pictures shareholder, Joseph Siegman, seeks to block the tender offer and the acquisition and asks for unspecified damages.
The suit, which also names Columbia Pictures, asks the court to certify it as a class action. 

The suit charges that on Sept. 27, Sony received an option to buy the more than 40% of Columbia's shares held by Coca-Cola Co. Sony thus became an "interested stockholder" under Delaware law because it held more than 15%, the suit says. 

The action charges that Delaware law doesn't allow an interested stockholder to combine with the target company for three years.
The suit says that the Sony-Columbia deal doesn't qualify under certain exceptions in the law. 

In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Columbia Pictures called the lawsuit "wholly without merit."
