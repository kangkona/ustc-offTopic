Worried about how to correct past discrimination?
Confused about the effects of affirmative-action plans or equal-opportunity programs? 

Fret no more.
A group of economists at New York University have assembled four equations that explain it all to you.
Here's how it works.
The economists look at the climb up the corporate ladder as a tournament. "We view corporations as entities which hold prizes over people's heads," says Andrew Schotter, chairman of the economics department at NYU, and one of the authors of the study. 

Look at the experience of poor Ms. J.
Because of past discrimination -- say, being steered away from math classes -- she isn't as well prepared as Mr. I to succeed, so she doesn't try as hard and doesn't get promoted as often.
Her tournament, says Mr. Schotter, is "uneven":

When the firm changes the rules to make it easier for Ms. J to succeed even without doing as well as Mr. I, Ms. J does get promoted more easily.
And if the past discrimination was really severe, she'll even start working harder.
But if the new rules corrected only moderate discrimination, both she and Mr. I start goofing off and not working so hard:

Now look at the experience at another company.
Here, Ms. I is fighting against skewed rules: Her company promotes mainly members of the old-boy network.
Obviously, the tournament in this company isn't uneven, but unfair, because it's easier for her colleague, Mr. J, to get promoted:

If the company bans that kind of preferential treatment, however, it gets a pleasant bonus:

Not only does Ms. I get promoted more, but both sides work harder. "When you take away preferential treatment, everyone's effort level goes up, and the firm is better off," says Mr. Schotter. 

All clear now?
