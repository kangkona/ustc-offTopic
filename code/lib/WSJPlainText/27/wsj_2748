Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp., a unit of Los Angeles-based Maxxam Inc., said it plans to redeem three separate issues of pollution-control revenue bonds, with a total of about $31.9 million outstanding, as part of a debt refinancing. 

The bonds to be redeemded include: about $14.9 million outstanding of $22 million face amount of Parish of East Baton Rouge, La., Pollution Control Revenue Bonds, 1975 Series A, expected to be redeemed June 1; about $14.4 million outstanding of $25 million face amount of Parish of St. Bernard, La., Pollution Control Revenue Bonds, 1975 Series A, expected to be redeemed June 1; and about $2.6 million outstanding of $4.8 million face amount of Parish of St. Bernard Pollution Control Revenue Bonds, 1973 Series A, expected to be redeemed May 1. 

The tax-free pollution-control revenue bonds provided financing for capital spending on environmental projects at the aluminum company's plants.
A company spokesman said one reason these bonds are being redeemed is that the portions of the facilities the bonds were used to finance are no longer operating.
