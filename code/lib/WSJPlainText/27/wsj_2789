Durakon Industries Inc. said it signed a letter of intent with an unnamed investor group for the sale of Durakon's Jerr-Dan Corp. unit. 

The purchase price will equal the approximate net worth of the subsidiary on the day before the closing.
Jerr-Dan's current estimated net worth is about $20 million, said David Laro, Durakon's president.
The purchase will be in cash and $5.2 million of subordinated notes.
The letter of intent calls for the sale to be completed by Dec. 17. 

Durakon said the deal is contingent on several factors, including the prospective purchaser's ability to obtain financing. 

In the fall of 1988, Durakon, a maker of truck-bed liners, agreed to sell Jerr-Dan to a group that included some Jerr-Dan managers.
That agreement was later canceled.
In January 1989, Durakon hired investment banker Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to conduct an auction for the unit, a maker and distributor of vehicle carriers.
Mr. Laro said the deal announced yesterday is the result of that auction. 

Separately, Durakon said it has signed a new supply agreement with Nissan Motor Corp. 's U.S. manufacturing operation to provide pickup-bed liners for the Japanese auto maker's trucks. 

Durakon declined to provide details of the pact, but Mr. Laro said the agreement represents "significant new business" for Durakon, which has been a Nissan supplier since November 

As part of the pact, Durakon is building a 10,000 square-foot manufacturing plant near Nissan's Smyrna, Tenn., facility.
The Durakon plant will be the company's first satellite bed-liner manufacturing facility and will employ roughly a dozen people. 

The new agreement took effect Oct. 1. 

In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Durakon shares rose 25 cents to close at $7.375.
