Lubrizol Corp., hurt by foreign currency translations and increased costs, said it expects to report that third-quarter operating profit declined from operating profit of $24.7 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier. 

In the 1988 third quarter the company earned $10.7 million, or 28 cents a share, after restructuring charges of $23.3 million.
A spokesman declined to say whether the latest quarter includes any charges. 

The Wickcliffe, Ohio, maker of specialty chemicals, fuel and lubricants said it adjusted prices to offset rising raw material costs, but "customer acceptance has been slower than anticipated." 

The company also said it completed the acquisition of Sungene Technologies Corp., San Jose, Calif.
Terms weren't disclosed.
Sungene and a joint venture company were involved in agricultural biotechnology research programs for Lubrizol. 

In addition, Lubrizol said it filed suits against Exxon Corp. in Canada, France and the United Kingdom, charging that Exxon infringed on certain patents.
The international patents correspond to one of the 10 U.S. patents admitted as valid by Exxon in a suit concluded by court order last year, Lubrizol said.
Exxon had no comment.
