Anti-abortion forces were dealt a big defeat as Florida's legislature adjourned midway into a four-day special session after swiftly rejecting a host of measures to restrict abortion. 

Gov. Bob Martinez called the session in hope of tightening abortion controls after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in July, which intimated the court would give states broad authority to regulate abortions. 

Abortion-rights advocates said the legislature's sound rejection of the measures signals that momentum is gathering to fight abortion controls as a result of the Supreme Court's ruling in July. 

Two committees in the House and two in the Senate knocked down a variety of proposals, including one that would have required viability testing of a fetus after five months and barred abortions for those deemed viable.
Other measures would have created a seven-day waiting period for abortions, required spousal notification, restricted public funding and toughened state regulation of clinics. 

The call for clinic regulation, which appeared to draw the broadest support, came on the heels of wide publicity about several troubled Florida clinics that the state recently closed.
An effort to revive that measure before the full Senate got a 22-18 vote, but failed to get the two-thirds majority needed.
The Senate voted to create a special committee to study the issue and report on it another session in November. 

Some critics believe Gov. Martinez made a strategic blunder by holding the session just days after a Florida Supreme Court ruling that broadly upheld abortion rights based on a state constitutional privacy right.
