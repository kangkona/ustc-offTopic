HAL Acquisition Inc. extended its tender offer for HAL Inc., the Honolulu holding company for Hawaiian Airlines, to Nov. 15, and disclosed details about union concessions and financing. 

HAL Acquisition, an investor group led by J. Thomas Talbot, founder of Jet America Airlines, and former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth, is offering $22 a share for all of HAL's stock outstanding, or a total of $43 million.
HAL's board, which includes John H. Magoon Jr., HAL's chairman and owner of 57% of its stock, has agreed in principle to accept the offer, and to tender 1.1 million shares. 

Mr. Talbot, president of HAL Acquisition, said it had reached agreements with each of HAL's five unions, which call for no wage increases in the first three years of their contracts, and increases of 4% in the fourth year and 5% in the fifth year. 

Mr. Talbot said HAL Acquisition also obtained preliminary commitments from Security Pacific National Bank to provide secured loans of as much as $101 million to finance the offer, including $55 million in secured revolving loans to provide working capital and finance capital spending.
