Weatherford International Inc. said it canceled plans for a preferred stock swap but may resume payment of dividends on the stock.
It also filed to offer publicly about 10 million common shares, expected in November. 

The Houston energy services concern said it planned to offer an undetermined number of common shares in exchange for the 585,000 shares of its preferred stock outstanding.
The exchange ratio was never established.
Weatherford said market conditions led to the cancellation. 

The company said it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock in January.
It suspended the dividend in October 1985 and said it hasn't any current plans to catch up the $6 million of dividends in arrears, but plans to do so. 

The company said Salomon Brothers Inc. and Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs Inc., underwriters for the offering, have been granted an option to purchase up to an additional 1,500,000 shares to cover over-allotments.
Proceeds will be used to eliminate and restructure bank debt.
Weatherford currently has about 11.1 million common shares outstanding.
