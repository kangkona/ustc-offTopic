Vitro S.A. has received a commitment from Security Pacific National Bank to provide funds for Vitro's $20-a-share tender offer for Anchor Glass Container Corp. 

According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Security Pacific, a unit of Security Pacific Corp., made a commitment to lend Vitro $139 million to acquire shares in the $251.4 million offer and to pay related fees and expenses. 

The bank also agreed to lend $245 million to Vitro at the time of the merger in the form of a term loan and to provide the company with a revolving credit facility of between $110 million and $185 million. 

The tender offer from Vitro, a Monterrey, Mexico-based glass manufacturer, has been extended until 12:01 a.m. EDT, Oct. 14. 

Executives at Anchor, based in Tampa, Fla., couldn't be reached for comment. 

Separately, Vitro agreed to drop a lawsuit challenging Oklahoma's anti-takeover laws after receiving assurances that the statutes won't interfere with the company's offer for Anchor.
