First Union Corp., Charlotte, N.C., reported a 4.4% decline in third-quarter earnings to $70.7 million, or 66 cents a share, as price competition continued to pressure net interest margins. 

The latest quarter's profit compares with $73.3 million, or 69 cents a share, in the 1988 third quarter.
In the 1988 period, earnings for the regional bank-holding company were buoyed by an $8 million after-tax gain from the sale of mortgage-servicing rights. 

First Union's net interest income, squeezed between lower rates on loans and higher rates for deposits, decreased 5% to $282 million during the 1989 quarter.
In addition, the company said the growth in higher-cost deposits during the period offset net interest income from strong growth in loans. 

For the nine months, First Union's net income fell 4.4% to $216.6 million, or $2.03 a share, from $226.4 million, or $2.10 a share, in 1988. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, First Union closed at $24, down 37.5 cents.
