Gannett Co. posted an 11% gain in third-quarter net income.
Total ad pages dropped at USA Today, but advertising revenue rose because of a higher circulation rate base and increased rates. 

Net rose to $83.1 million, or 52 cents a share, from $75.1 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue increased 3% to $828 million from $804 million. 

Gannett's 83 daily and 35 non-daily newspapers reported a 3% increase in advertising and circulation revenue.
Total advertising linage was "modestly" lower as classified ad volume increased, while there was "softer demand" for retail and national ad linage. 

John Curley, the Washington company's chief executive officer, chairman and president, said the results reflected lower newsprint costs in its newspaper division and "cost controls" at USA Today, Gannett's daily national newspaper that has yet to post a profitable year. 

Gannett stock fell $1.50 a share yesterday to close at $43.50 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
