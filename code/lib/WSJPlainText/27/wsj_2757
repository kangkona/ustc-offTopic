CalFed Inc., Los Angeles, said it agreed to sell Anglo American Insurance Co., its London-based property-casualty unit, to an affiliate of John Head & Partners Limited Partnership, a New York merchant banking firm, for about $100 million. 

CalFed, a thrift holding company, didn't disclose the precise terms, but it is expected to record a slight net profit on the transaction.
Anglo American was capitalized in 1987 at $80 million, but CalFed has put in additional equity since then and will owe taxes on the proceeds.
The insurance unit underwrites excess lines of property and casualty coverage, and is expected to earn $9 million to $10 million in 1989. 

Jerry St. Dennis, CalFed's president, said the sale, expected to close in early 1990, would allow the company to "redeploy a substantial amount of capital." The transaction is subject to the approval of British regulators.
