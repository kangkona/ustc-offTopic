MCorp said it reached a definitive agreement to sell its trust and investment unit to AmeriTrust Corp. for $105 million in cash and a $15 million note. 

MCorp is a Dallas bank holding company that has been in bankruptcy-law proceedings since regulators stripped it of 20 of its 25 banks in March.
After a lengthy auction, Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, won the bidding for the failed banks. 

Bank One also had expressed interest in MCorp's MVestment unit, which handles about $17 billion in trust and custody assets. 

MCorp said in June that it would consider selling the MVestment unit, because it had received numerous inquiries about it.
The unit had pretax profit of $13.7 million on revenue of $46 million for the first nine months of 1989. 

AmeriTrust, based in Cleveland, said the purchase will push its trust operations into one of the nation's 20 largest, giving it about $48 billion in trust and custody assets. 

The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and approval of the bankruptcy court overseeing MCorp's reorganization.
