A gloomier outlook for interest rates and some bad news from the takeover front sent the stock market falling further from its record highs. 

But late buying in some blue-chip issues, coupled with a modest amount of futures-related program buying, allowed the Dow Jones Industrial Average to finish well above its session lows. 

The Dow industrials, which went down 6.08 Tuesday, fell another 11.97 to 2773.36 after hitting bottom at midday with a loss of more than 27 points. 

Several traders said the latest setback reflected the market's continued concern with statements from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who indicated Tuesday that the Fed won't cut rates to keep the dollar in check on foreign-exchange markets. 

"This market is telling us that unless he does, we won't be able to continue (advancing) here," said James C. Andrews, first vice president in charge of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott, Philadelphia. 

Developments on the takeover front provided additional incentive for players to step up the profit-taking that began to surface Tuesday, traders said.
Those developments included: 

-- The cancellation of a junk-bond offering that would have permitted Ramada to carry out a planned restructuring involving the sale of its hotel operations and the spinoff of its casino business.
Ramada retreated 2 1/4 to 11 as 1.7 million shares changed hands in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

The company's decision to forgo the debt offering, attributed to unfavorable conditions in the high-yield market, represented the first time since that market plunged last month that an issue had been withdrawn. 

-- The termination of MGM/UA Communications' agreement to be acquired by Qintex Australia for $25 a share, or about $1.5 billion, after Qintex failed to deliver a required $50 million letter of credit.
MGM/UA dropped 1 to 20. -- The prospect of congressional action that would delay any effort by Donald Trump to unseat the board of AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, in order to advance his $120-a-share takeover bid.
AMR skidded 4 1/4 to 97 1/8 on 2.6 million shares. 

Ramada, MGM-UA and AMR were among the 1,021 stocks that declined in price on the Big Board.
Only 458 issues advanced. 

Trading on the Big Board was moderate, as volume rose to 164,070,000 shares from 147.6 million in the previous session. 

Broader market averages posted sharper losses than the Dow industrials.
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index dropped 2.14 to 356.99, the Dow Jones Equity Market Index skidded 2.05 to 335.01 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index declined 1.19 to 197.81. 

Blue chips cushioning the fall in the Dow industrials included Boeing, which gained 1 1/8 to 59 1/2 as investors anticipated a possible $5 billion plane order from Northwest Airlines and an expected resumption of contract talks with striking machinists. 

Other stocks in the Dow industrials that bucked the market's downturn included Chevron, which went up 1 1/4 to 67; Woolworth, up 1/2 to 67; Procter & Gamble, up 1/2 to 131 3/8 and Exxon, up 3/8 to 46 1/8. 

The Dow Jones Transportation Average, which had surpassed 1500 last Thursday for the first time in a month, dropped below the century mark as other airline stocks followed AMR to lower levels.

Gulf States Utilities, the most active Big Board issue, dropped 2 1/8 to 12 1/8 as 7.4 million shares were traded.
A Louisiana judge affirmed a decision by state regulators to prevent the utility from recovering $1.4 billion in costs associated with its River Bend nuclear plant through rate increases. 

But the stock closed well above its session low of 10 3/8 as Salomon Brothers, and possibly other brokerage houses, recommended purchase of the stock.
The judge also endorsed plans that would permit Gulf States to boost its revenue, offsetting the effects of the cost-recovery decision. 

Upjohn gained 2 1/4 to 41 5/8 on 3.2 million shares.
