The Federal Trade Commission unanimously approved a proposal to regulate the telephone-marketing industry under the same rules that apply to the mail-order catalog business. 

The main provision affects delays in shipments.
Currently, mail-order companies must notify consumers if they can't ship their products within the time promised in a catalog.
If the delay will be up to 30 days, the purchaser can cancel the order and if it is more than 30 days, the order is automatically canceled unless the consumer agrees to a longer delay. 

The new rule would apply to merchandise ordered through the direct or indirect use of the telephone, including telefax machines. 

Comments on the rule extension to telemarketing was overwhelmingly favored in written comments submitted to the commission over the past year, FTC officials said.
The agency will send a notice of the proposed rule to Congress and publish it in the Federal Register.
Then, there will be a 30-day period for additional comments before the rule can take effect, a spokeswoman said.
