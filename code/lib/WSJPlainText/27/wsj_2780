The junk bond market received more bad news yesterday when Ramada Inc. withdrew its offering of high-yield debt securities as nervous investors balked.
The Phoenix, Ariz.-based hotel and casino operator said it shelved an already postponed and sweetened $400 million offering by Aztar Corp., a new company formed to operate Ramada's gambling operations.
Underwriter Salomon Brothers Inc. indicated it couldn't find sufficient buyers for some of the bonds.
In reaction, junk bond prices fell.
The broader bond market also lost ground yesterday, with long-term Treasury securities ending 1/2 point lower, or down about $5 for each $1,000 face amount.
Ramada's decision to pull back the issue raised concern about the market's ability to absorb the $11 billion of new high-yield junk issues scheduled to be sold before year end.
Yesterday's scuttled bond offering is yet another sign of how skittish junk bond investors have become in recent months.
And it suggests that the division between "good" and "bad" junk taking place in the market is picking up momentum.
One month after the cash squeeze at Campeau Corp. jolted the market and caused junk prices to plunge, "the junk bond market remains in turmoil," said John Lonski, senior economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc.
Many of the better-quality junk issues will sell easily, traders said.
For example, Turner Broadcasting System Inc. 's $550 million issue of 12-year senior subordinated debentures, priced late Tuesday, on yesterday rose about a point, or $10 for each $1,000 of debt.
Strong investor demand prompted Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to boost the size of the issue from an originally planned $500 million.
And many investors are eagerly awaiting next week's planned $475 million issue from CNW's Chicago & North Western railroad business.
But Moody's Mr. Lonski estimated that half of the issues on the calendar will never make it to market. "Some of the issues will be delayed or postponed, but many will just die," he said.
In the past month alone, Alco Health Distribution Corp. restructured an offering, and J&L Specialty Products Corp. scaled down a planned offering.
In August, First Boston Corp. was forced to pull a $475 million offering by Ohio Mattress Co. after it became clear that investors were shunning the bonds.
Credit analysts contended that the structure and quality of the Aztar bonds weren't much different from other gambling industry junk debt that was successfully placed with investors in recent months.
Thus the Aztar bonds, they said, were the latest casualty of the junk market's jitters.
Barry Schwartz, a casino analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., said Aztar's problems weren't as much a "fundamentals problem as a market problem." Added Frank V. Colombo, director of highyield research at Dillon, Read & Co., "It's not a very hospitable climate to come to market." "Unless it meets our criteria, we will be extremely choosy when buying new junk bonds," said J. Michael Pokorny, high yield portfolio manager at Delaware Management, which has about $3 billion of junk bonds. "I question {whether the market} will see $11 billion in new bonds." Overall, junk bond prices fell between 1/2 point and one point yesterday.
Even so-called high quality junk bonds were hurt.
RJR Holdings Capital Corp. 's 14.7% convertible pay-in-kind securities due 2009 fell 1 7/8 to end the day at 96 3/8.
So-called PIK securities pay interest in the form of additional securities.
Also under pressure yesterday were Trump's Taj Mahal Funding 14% first mortgage bonds of 1998.
The bonds fell about 10 points on news that three executives of Donald Trump's Atlantic City casinos were killed in a helicopter crash.
Investors are watching carefully to see what happens to a number of junk bond offerings that have been expected from companies considered vulnerable to a recession.
Among them are York International, Ethan Allen and a Continental Airlines issue, which was on the calendar in recent weeks and hasn't yet appeared.
In contrast, however, there are plenty of high-yield issues that bond buyers find attractive.
J. Thomas Madden at Federated Investors Corp., for example, likes Chicago & North Western Railroads, which is due to be priced next week. "It looks like a classic.
There are assets that may be divested to cut the debt over time, and there is a real economic need for the company's main business," which is to carry coal to the Midwest from the West, he said. "Probably most importantly, the growth of revenue and earnings before taxes and depreciation has been positive and steady since 1985." Treasury Securities U.S. Treasurys ended with losses of as much as 1/2 point on continued profit-taking, new supply and concerns that upcoming economic data won't give the Federal Reserve a reason to ease monetary policy.
The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 100 23/32 to yield 8.05% compared with Tuesday's price of 101 6/32 to yield 8%.
The latest 10-year notes were priced late at 99 13/32 to yield 8.07% compared with 99 22/32 to yield 8.03% on Tuesday.
Short-term rates rose yesterday.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills ended at about 7.71% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.95%, while six-month bills ended at about 7.68% for a yield of 8.08%.
Meanwhile, investors were unenthusiastic over the Treasury's latest note offering.
The government sold $7.53 billion of new seven-year notes at an average yield of 8.08%.
The yield was up from 7.89% at the previous seven-year note auction on July 12 and was the highest yield since 9.39% at the April 12 auction.
Despite the higher yield, small investors didn't show much interest in the notes.
Here are details of yesterday's seven-year note auction: Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value.
Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.
Applications $18,457,957,000 Accepted bids $7,530,802,000 Accepted at low price 74% Accepted noncompetitively $221,000,000 Average price (Rate) 99.579 (8.08%) High price (Rate) 99.631 (8.07%) Low price (Rate) 99.579 (8.08%) Interest rate 8.00% The notes are dated October 16 and mature October 15, 1996.
Mortgage-Backed Securities The derivative mortgage securities market had one of its busiest days ever as nearly $2 billion of new issues were priced.
The heavy volume, which included the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 's 100th real estate mortgage investment conduit offering, reflected a move by Wall Street dealers to repackage the heavy supply of new mortgage securities hitting the secondary market.
Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for October delivery ended at 97 23/32, down 9/32; and Freddie Mac 9% securities were at 96 29/32, down 7/32. 

Ginnie Mae 9% securities yielded 9.45% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note held at 1.38 percentage points. 

Corporate Issues 

Investment-grade corporate bonds fell 1/8 to 1/4 point while high-yield bonds fell between 1/2 point and one point. 

Tennessee Valley Authority is expected to announce today the details of its long-awaited re-entry into the public debt market. 

Widely expected is a $3 billion threetranche offering consisting of $1.5 billion of 30-year securities with a five-year call provision and $750 million each of five-year and 10-year securities. 

The new securities, with First Boston Corp. as lead underwriter, are expected to be priced early next week as part of the TVA's $6.5 billion refinancing program. 

If TVA goes ahead with its planned offering, it will mark the first time in 15 years the agency has tapped the public debt market. 

Municipals 

Actively traded municipal bonds finished 1/8 to 3/4 point lower in moderately active trading, as the market was under pressure all session. 

New Jersey Turnpike Authority 7.20% issue of 2018 was 3/4 point weaker in late trading at 97 3/4 to 97 7/8, yielding 7.38%. 

Municipals, traders said, were injured by influences including the weak performance of Treasury issues and profit-taking. 

Overall, some analysts said, yesterday's slump may be a healthy correction after the recent surge in prices.
Municipals have posted strong gains recently, largely because of diminished worries about excess supply. 

Foreign Bonds 

Japanese government bonds fell yesterday, responding to a stronger dollar and an increase in the discount rate. 

The Bank of Japan boosted the rate half a percentage point to 3.75% from 3.25%.
It is the base rate on loans to commercial banks. 

The Japanese government bond market weakened briefly after the increase was announced.
Then the market recovered, only to fall again when the dollar gained strength. 

"Most people were expecting a one percentage point hike," said a Japanese trader.
So some people believe that "the yen won't recover that much" and that the Bank of Japan will have to consider raising the key rate even further. 

The dollar dipped briefly below 143 yen after the increase, but rebounded smartly to end in Tokyo at 143.9 yen.
Earlier in the day the dollar was as high as 144.95 yen. 

Japan's benchmark No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended 0.79 point lower at 95.04 to yield 5.44%. 

Elsewhere: 

-- British government bonds fell for the third consecutive day due to a weak pound.
The Treasury's 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 fell 5/32 to 110 14/32 to yield 10.28%, while in the shorter end of the market, the 12% notes due 1995 rose 1/32 to 102 24/32 to yield 11.27%. 

-- West Germany's benchmark 6 3/4% bond due 1999 fell 0.62 point to 97.78 to yield 7.07%, the highest yield this year, while the 6 3/4% notes dropped 0.45 point to 97.8 to yield 7.32, also a high for the year. 

More than $11 billion of new high-yield corporate bonds are scheduled to be sold before year end.
