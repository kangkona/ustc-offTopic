Thortec Internaional Inc. said it reached agreements with an investor group and Wells Fargo Bank under which it will receive loans and an equity infusion in return for stock that will reduce the number of shares in public hands by as much as 85%. 

The engineering and consulting firm, which has been plagued by losses for five years, said the restructuring is required to relieve its debt burden and "acute shortage of cash." 

Richard C. Blum and Associates Inc., the investor group, agreed to provide $12.5 million in equity and new loans, and extend the due date of an existing $6 million loan from Nov. 1 to the year 2000.
Wells Fargo Bank, a unit of Wells Fargo & Co., agreed to forgive certain debt which would reduce Thortec's obligation to the bank to $17 million from $26.7 million and provide $4.8 million of new loans. 

The agreement is contingent on repurchase of at least 90% of Thortec's $38 million principal amount of public debt at prices expected to be in the recent trading range for the bonds.
Those bonds are trading at slightly less than 20% of face value. 

Thortec said it intends to offer public shareholders the right to buy eight million shares at 47.7 cents a share.
Proceeds would be used to repay $3.5 million owed the Blum group.
If the proceeds aren't sufficent to fully repay the loan, the difference would be converted by the Blum group to Thortec shares at 47.7 cents a share.
If the offer is fully subscribed, the public shareholders' remaining stake in Thortec would rise to 28.5% from the 15% stake they would have if the Blum group and Wells Fargo receive their stock and exercise their warrants. 

Thortec, which traded as high as $23 a share in late 1987, closed yesterday at $1.125, down 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
