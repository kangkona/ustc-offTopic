Simon & Schuster, New York, said it named two executive vice presidents, in anticipation of the retirement of its president and chief publishing officer, Jeremiah Kaplan. 

The publishing arm of communications giant Paramount Communications Inc. said Jonathan Newcomb, 43 years old, was named to the newly created post of executive vice president of operations, while Patrick C. Donaghy, 56, was named executive vice president of educational publishing, also a newly created post. 

Mr. Kaplan, 63, will retire at year end, the company said, "in accordance with his original assignment to serve two years." His post won't be filled. 

The nation's biggest publisher remains headed by Richard E. Snyder, chairman and chief executive officer. 

Mr. Kaplan joined Simon & Schuster from Macmillan Inc., where he headed publishing operations.
He couldn't be reached to comment. 

Mr. Newcomb was president of Simon & Schuster's professional information group.
Mr. Donaghy had been president of the publisher's school group.
