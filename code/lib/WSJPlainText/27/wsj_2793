Midway Airlines said it plans to operate nonstop flights to 11 additional cities from Philadelphia International Airport.
The move is the carrier's first scheduling push aimed at building a hub of operations in Philadelphia. 

Midway plans new Philadelphia service to seven Florida cities beginning Nov. 15: Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Miami, Orlando, Sarasota, Tampa and West Palm Beach. 

Starting Dec. 1, Midway plans to start flights from Philadelphia to Albany, N.Y., Boston, Buffalo and Hartford/Springfield, Conn.
Albany, Buffalo and Hartford are new destinations for the carrier. 

The rise of a second hub in Philadelphia is significant because it marks Midway's attempt to shed its regional airline image and become more a national carrier.
The carrier's biggest rival will be USAir Group Inc., which is the largest provider of passenger service in Philadelphia with about half of the airport's daily boardings and departures. 

To woo customers, Midway began selling introductory discount tickets yesterday for its Philadelphia flights. 

By the end of the first quarter of 1990, the carrier said it plans to have 70 daily departures out of Philadelphia; by early 1992 it said it plans to have 120 departures daily to 35 cities.
The airline currently operates six departures to its Chicago hub. 

Last month, a federal bankruptcy judge cleared the path for this expansion by approving the sale of eight Philadelphia gates owned by Texas Air Corp. 's Eastern Airlines, which has been under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code since March 9. 

The $210 million transaction also included the sale of 16 DC-9 aircraft, route authority from Philadelphia to Toronto and Ontario and takeoff and landing slots at Washington's National and New York's La Guardia airports.
