Readers of this space may recall a mini-flap awhile back when we echoed an Associated Press report that Nicaragua had joined Cuba and Vietnam as the only governments to support China's brutal crackdown in Tiananmen Square.
Our Viewpoint columnist Alexander Cockburn, among others, howled that the Sandinistas had said no such thing.
It now turns out that the Chinese agree with AP.
On September 12, the Xinhua news agency reported on a visit to Beijing by Henry Ruiz, a member of the Sandinista Directorate. "Ruiz said Nicaragua and China have a common history of struggle," Xinhua reported. "China's quelling of anti-government riots are of international strategic significance, and Nicaragua gives China firm support in this."
