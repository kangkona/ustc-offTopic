Cigarette-vending machines will be snuffed out in this St. Paul suburb in 90 days under an ordinance passed by the city council.
One health expert calls the move the first of its kind in the nation. 

The measure calls for the removal of the 19 cigarette-vending machines in bars, gas stations, convenience stores and apartment and office buildings in this town of 24,000. 

Supporters of the law include the city Fire Department, several University of Minnesota researchers, and business leaders. 

"We believe White Bear Lake is the first city in the country to ban cigarette-vending machines," said Jean Forster, assistant professor of public health at the University of Minnesota. 

Bill Bennis, who was the sole dissenter among the five council members voting on the matter, said eliminating the vending machines isn't "attacking the real problem.
If merchants are sincere about this, they'd take cigarettes out of their place of business." 

A local group claims that most young smokers get their cigarettes from machines. 

Nationally, an estimated 3.5 million young people aged 12 to 17 consume $1 billion of tobacco products a year.
Studies indicate that half of all smokers begin at age 13.
