CBS Inc. said third-quarter net income fell 11%, despite a 4.5% gain in sales, in part due to sluggish results at its CBS/Fox videocasette venture. 

Laurence A. Tisch, president and chief operating officer, commented that results at the CBS Television Network were good, however, and will continue to improve through the rest of year because of a "robust advertising market." 

Net income in the quarter fell to $61.8 million, or $2.40 a share, from $69.8 million, or $2.72 a share. 

Sales rose to $593.2 million from $568.0 million.
Pretax operating profit was $50 million, up 2%. 

CBS said profit for the CBS Television Network rose in the quarter, partly due to renewed advertising demand, but didn't provide details. "CBS has two new shows that are doing well," said John Tinker, an analyst with Morgan Stanley and Co."Major Dad," a situation comedy, and "Island Son," a medical drama. 

CBS noted the year-earlier figures reflected costs from coverage of the 1988 presidential election campaign.
This year it incurred hefty spending for prime-time programming as well as higher promotional costs, including a tie-in contest with K mart Corp. 

Joint-venture profit fell to $1.2 million from $6.9 million a year earlier, mainly reflecting results of CBS/Fox, a partnership with News Corp. 's Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. 

Profit from continuing operations for the first nine months of 1989 was $236.9 million, compared to $243.3 million; year-earlier net income included an after-tax nonrecurring gain of $866.6 million from sale of CBS/Records to Sony Corp. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, CBS closed at $207.50, down $1.75 a share.
