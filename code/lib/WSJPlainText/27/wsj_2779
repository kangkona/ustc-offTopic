A Zapata Corp. unit filed a $20 million lawsuit against Occidental Petroleum Corp., seeking damages related to an explosion that occurred when a Zapata fishing vessel ran into an Occidental natural gas pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico. 

Zapata alleges that the pipeline, operated by Occidental's Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America unit, was at least one foot from the bottom of the sea floor in about 10 feet of water.
Eleven crew members were killed in the explosion and fire Oct. 3 and three others were injured, Zapata said. 

Natural Gas Pipeline, meantime, filed a suit against the Zapata unit, Zapata Haynie Corp., for damages caused to the pipeline and loss of the natural gas and natural gas liquid. 

The suit, filed in federal court for the Southern District of Texas, alleges that "the 45-year-old vessel was operating in very shallow waters and apparently wasn't equipped with depth finders, metal detectors, or any navigational maps showing the underwater pipeline," Natural Gas Pipeline said. 

An Occidental spokesman in Los Angeles said the total extent of the damages isn't known, "but it will certainly be in the millions of dollars."
