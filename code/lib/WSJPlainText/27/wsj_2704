Ralston Purina Co., which in July agreed in principle to sell its Bremner cookie-and-cracker unit to a unit of Onex Corp. in Toronto, said it discontinued the sale plans. 

Ralston said it decided against selling Bremner to the Canadian concern "after careful analysis of the final offer." Terms of the proposed deal haven't been disclosed. 

"We are committed to continue operating the business under Ralston ownership," the company said. "Bremner Inc. is no longer for sale to any other party." 

Bremner, based in Louisville, Ky., has annual sales of about $75 million and employs about 450 people.
