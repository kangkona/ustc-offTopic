Vernitron Corp. filed a lawsuit, alleging Kollmorgen Corp. violated securities law in connection with the companies' agreement to merge. 

The suit also contains specific reasons that Vernitron broke off its plan to acquire Kollmorgen.
Last month, Vernitron, a closely held industrial electronics company here, withdrew from a plan to acquire for $320 million the Simsbury, Conn., maker of electronic, industrial and defense products.
At the time, Vernitron cited "adverse changes" in Kollmorgen that it said it didn't anticipate; a spokeswoman wouldn't elaborate. 

In the latest move in the companies' 10-month battle, Vernitron filed suit in federal court in Hartford, Conn.
Recently, Kollmorgen obtained an order from a Connecticut Superior Court judge, temporarily blocking Vernitron from pursuing any further proposals to acquire Kollmorgen. 

Vernitron's suit seeks to void the merger agreement.
It also asks for actual damages of at least $16.8 million and punitive damages of $35 million. 

Vernitron's charges "are a transparent effort after the fact to attempt to justify Vernitron's breach of the agreement," Kollmorgen said, adding that it will fight the complaint.
