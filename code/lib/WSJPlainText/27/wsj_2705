Laidlaw Transportation Ltd. said shareholders will be asked at its Dec. 7 annual meeting to approve a change of name to Laidlaw Inc. 

The company said its existing name hasn't represented its businesses since the 1984 sale of its trucking operations.
Laidlaw is a waste management and school-bus operator, in which Canadian Pacific Ltd. has a 47% voting interest.
