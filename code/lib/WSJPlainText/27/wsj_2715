Reform can't possibly make Chicago's schools worse than the education bureaucrats already have.
Now Chicagoans are trying to put an end to all that.
Yesterday and today they have been going to the polls to elect new local councils, one for each school.
There will be six parents on each council, two community residents and two teachers. 

The new council arrangement takes power away from the central-district education blob and tries to put it in the hands of parents.
Already, 500 jobs have been cut from the central bureaucracy.
Parents don't have education degrees.
Parents don't have subscriptions to the leading education journals.
Yet the consensus is that parents will do a better job of running the schools. 

The elections have generated a lot of enthusiasm in neighborhoods across the city.
There are 17,000 candidates competing for 5,400 seats on the local councils.
In general the races have not been dominated by ideological activists.
Voters don't seem to want intervention by professional busybodies.
Mayor Daley has also been smart enough to stay aloof, and has even warned parents that special interests threaten the success of local councils.
In New York City, many semi-local boards are corrupt cesspools run by activists and hacks.
They have turned voters away from local control. 

The local-control idea might flop.
An alternative plan is to let specialists run the schools, but give parents the choice over which school their children will attend.
At least, though, parents are repudiating the arrogant bureaucracy that created this mess.
