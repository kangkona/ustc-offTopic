Tokyo stocks, briefly shaken by an unexpected discount rate increase by the Bank of Japan, closed with moderate losses but bounced back strongly from their intraday lows. 

London share prices were flat after two days of sharp declines, with the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ending exactly even with its previous close. 

Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues, down nearly 400 at one point, closed at 35240.07, down 136.28.
The index rose 167.00 Monday.
The Tokyo market was closed Tuesday for a holiday. 

In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei Index fell 109.08 points to 35130.99. 

Wednesday's volume on the first section was estimated at 750 million shares, compared with 710 million Monday.
Declining issues swamped advancers, 781-221, with 127 unchanged.
The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the first section, which gained 14.18 points Monday, was down 13.07, or 0.49%, at 2660.49. 

The Bank of Japan announced in early afternoon that it was raising its discount rate, or rate on loans to commercial banks, half a percentage point to 3.75%.
Like last week's round of rate increases in Europe led by the West German Bundesbank, the move was aimed at combating a persistent rise by the dollar. 

The U.S. currency was stronger in Tokyo dealings yesterday after traders decided that comments by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan Tuesday signaled a reluctance to intervene further to keep the dollar down. 

Analysts said that what surprised the Tokyo market was the timing of the rate increase, which came earlier than expected, not its size.
They said a half-point rise had already been generally factored into current share prices -- and many said a half-point rise won't be enough to stop the dollar's appreciation against the yen and most other major currencies. 

Takanori Tanabe, chief investment strategist at Nomura Research Institute, said it would take at least an additional quarter-point increase to slow the dollar.
If the U.S. currency continues to go up, he said, anticipation of another discount rate increase will start to build in the stock market. 

Koji Kamemura, fund manager at Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance, said the impact of the rate increase was minimal in the stock market. "Investors' reaction was unexpectedly calm," he said. 

Many refrained from active buying in the afternoon, but they didn't completely stay on the sidelines, Mr. Kamemura said.
By late afternoon, some investors were returning to issues whose earnings prospects remain strong, he said. 

But traders said the rate increase destroyed hopes of a comeback among interest rate-sensitive larger-capitalization issues.
The focus will continue to be on rotational, selective buying in issues with strong earnings outlooks and low price-earnings ratios, they said. 

Major steel issues were lower across the board.
Nippon Steel lost 9 to 708 yen ($4.90) a share, NKK fell 13 to 685, and Kobe Steel declined 6 to 699 yen. 

Among construction shares, Kajima lost 20 to 2,000, Taisei was down 30 at 1,470, and Ohbayashi fell 60 to 1,560. 

Other losers included retails, pharmaceuticals, foods, real estates and railways. 

Car manufacturers and some home electronics makers advanced, attracting buying orders from corporate and individual investors. 

Autos were led by Toyota Motor, which was up 240 at 2,850.
Nissan Motor gained 20 to 1,570, and Mitsubishi Motors advanced 50 to 1,190. 

Sony rebounded from an early low of 9,230 to close at 9,390, up 10.
NEC gained 50 to 1,860, and Sharp was up 60 at 1,530. 

The London market broke even with the help of gains in certain blue-chip stocks rather than any easing of fears over high interest rates and a weak pound. 

The FT-SE 100 ended unchanged at 2218.8 as investors seemed to be awaiting today's speech by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson to the governing Conservative Party's annual conference. 

The Financial Times 30-share index ended 0.6 higher at 1797.3.
Volume was a modest 503.2 million shares, compared with 518.8 million Tuesday. 

Dealers said there was institutional interest in some recession-resistant blue-chip issues.
These included British Petroleum, which rose 4 1/2 to 306 1/2 pence ($4.76) a share, British Gas, unchanged at 203 1/2, and British Steel, which ended at 124 1/2, down 1 1/2. 

The market was still characterized as extremely worried about prospects for a U.K. recession.
But commentators said the prospect of Mr. Lawson's speech today appeared to be sidelining the aggressive sellers for the time being.
Although some dealers said they aren't expecting any major news developments from it, the speech could help settle market fears of further interest-rate increases. 

Imperial Chemical Industries, Britain's largest chemical company, rose 15 to #11.71 on news reports that suggested the company is coping well with the weakness in sterling.
ICI is among the FT-SE 100's leading shares, as is British Telecommunications, which rose 4 to 262. 

Dealers said the telecommunications company also rose in part on McCaw Cellular Communications' sweetened bid for LIN Broadcasting in the U.S. British Telecom holds a 20% stake in McCaw.
Racal Telecom also benefited from the interest in the U.S. cellular phone company, rising 3 to 381. 

Oil stocks were generally stronger, dealers said, on perceptions that the sector will hold up well because of its dollar-denominated earnings. 

Ultramar gained 3 to 328, London & Scottish Marine Oil rose 7 to 512, and Enterprise Oil gained 7 to 594.
Burmah, the focus of takeover speculation and other related rumors, ended at 637, up 2. 

Jaguar slid 17 to 636 on uncertainty over whether Ford Motor will still try to gain a minority stake in the British luxury car maker after the announcement this week that Jaguar will cooperate with General Motors on several fronts.
Talk of Ford's imminent move to acquire a stake in Sweden's Saab also has helped to damp interest in Jaguar. 

Reuters slid 26 to 915 on what traders described as heavy U.S. selling after several bullish sessions.
Some dealers said there were expectations that the news and information provider will suffer from high interest rates and cutbacks in equipment at U.K. financial institutions.
The action followed news of softer earnings Tuesday from Telerate, the New York-based electronic financial information concern that is 67%-owned by Dow Jones. 

In other European markets, share prices closed higher in Brussels and were mixed to higher in Stockholm and Milan and lower in Paris and Amsterdam.
South African gold stocks closed sharply lower in response to the stronger dollar, lower gold prices and an increase in South African interest rates. 

Elsewhere, stocks rose in Taipei, Singapore and Seoul and were lower in Hong Kong, Wellington and Sydney.
Trading in Manila was suspended because of a typhoon.
