Mattel Inc., Hawthorne, Calif., said it dropped plans to participate in a redevelopment of its headquarters property here, and instead bought a new 14-story, 330,000 square-foot office building in El Segundo, Calif., which it will occupy by year end.
Terms weren't disclosed. 

The toy maker agreed to sell its current 36-acre headquarters site to Comstock, Crosser & Hickey Development Co. of Manhattan Beach, Calif., which plans a $150 million redevelopment of the property to include a hotel, two restaurants, and retail and office buildings. 

Mattel had planned to participate in the redevelopment, but decided against it because of the disruption that would be caused by construction. "The new El Segundo building was available immediately and is well suited to the company's needs.
It will provide an excellent working environment without the disruption of two years of construction we would have lived through in Hawthorne," said John A. Sage, senior vice president, administration.
