The U.S. ended a four-year investigation of Brazil's treatment of computer and software imports after determining that sufficient progress is being made in opening the market to U.S. products. 

Trade Representative Carla Hills said Brazil is letting in more of such imports and is also allowing revenues from their sales to be repatriated to the U.S. and other countries.
She reported, moreover, that Brazil has expressed its willingness to open part of this market, possibly the largest of its kind in the Third World, to foreign investment. 

Although certain trade restrictions remain, Brazil appears to have gone more than halfway in meeting U.S. demands for liberalization of its so-called informatics policy.
The policy originally was intended to reserve certain parts of the computer industry -- particularly personal computers and software -- to Brazilian entrepreneurs. 

The trade dispute came to a head in November 1987 when the U.S. announced that it was preparing to levy trade sanctions against Brazil in retaliation for its denial of Microsoft Corp. 's right to sell its software to Brazilian users. 

The American Electronics Association and the Software Publishers Association issued statements noting that software piracy continues to plague foreign sellers in Brazil.
