A group of hotel companies affiliated with Australia's Qintex Group filed suit in federal court here against Golden Nugget Inc. over the casino company's use of the name "Mirage" for its new $630 million hotel-casino resort on the Las Vegas Strip. 

The Qintex companies have several resorts called "Mirage," located in Australia, Hawaii, and Southern California.
The suit claims that the Qintex companies have had correspondence with Golden Nugget regarding their objection to the use of the name "Mirage," but that Golden Nugget, which opens its "Mirage" next month, has declared it will stick with the name. 

"We feel very comfortable that we have good legal rights to use the name," said Bruce Levin, vice president and general counsel of Golden Nugget. 

The Qintex companies are seeking an injunction against the use of the name; unspecified compensatory damages to be trebled, or "Golden Nugget's profits" from using the name; and unspecified punitive damages. 

Qintex has agreed to buy for $1.5 billion MGM/UA Communications Co., the Beverly Hills, Calif., movie company 82%-owned by investor Kirk Kerkorian.
Mr. Kerkorian's other company, MGM Grand Inc., has plans to build along the Strip its own $700 million mega-resort, which will include a movie-studio, theme park and hotel-casino.
