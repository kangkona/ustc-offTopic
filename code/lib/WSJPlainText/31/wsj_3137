Soviet Defense Minister Dimitri Yazov was a perfect peaceable ambassador for glasnost as he toured U.S. military bases.
Hmmm.
A book published by Freedom House on the war in Afghanistan notes that General Yazov "was directly involved in the conduct of the war against the Afghan Resistance, in the lesson-learning derived from it and in the resulting innovations in Soviet operational art and tactics."
