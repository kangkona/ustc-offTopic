Hernando de Soto, author of "The Other Path," speaking to the Reason Forum Foundation in San Francisco: 

Switzerland has no cocoa, and my country does have cocoa, yet Switzerland produces better chocolate.
Japan has no iron.
My country does.
But Japan produces more and better steel than Peru.
Owning natural assets is not sufficient.
