The government of Alberta took control of financially troubled Gainers Inc., a meat-packing concern and corporate flagship of controversial Edmonton entrepreneur Peter Pocklington, after he breached the terms of a provincial loan agreement. 

The government also filed a suit against Mr. Pocklington in Alberta's Court of Queen's Bench, seeking to recover funds it is owed, including six million Canadian dollars (US$5.1 million) Mr. Pocklington borrowed from the government earlier this year to help finance construction of a planned Gainers pork plant, at Picture Butte, Alberta. 

The government's moves came a week after Mr. Pocklington missed a C$400,000 interest payment on the C$6 million government loan and failed for the second time in four months to meet a construction start-up deadline for the proposed C$22 million pork plant. 

Alberta treasurer Dick Johnston said the government expects to recover all of the funds it is owed. "There are more assets in the company than our total exposure," he said.
Mr. Johnston said Gainers has assets of about C$120 million, and the government's liabilities total slightly more than C$100 million, including a C$55 million loan guaranty. 

The government also took control of Gainers Properties Inc., a related concern. 

With annual sales estimated by Mr. Johnston at C$600 million to C$700 million, closely held Gainers is Mr. Pocklington's largest holding and ranks as Canada's second-largest meat-packing concern. 

But Gainers, hurt by slumping hog prices and the legacy of a bitter six-month strike at its Edmonton operations in 1986, including a continuing boycott of Gainers products by some of its own workers, is currently "losing hundreds of thousands of dollars" a week, Mr. Johnston said, after "considerable" losses last year.
He wouldn't offer specifics.
