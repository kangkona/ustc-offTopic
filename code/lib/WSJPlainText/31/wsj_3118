Metro Mobile CTS Inc. said it arranged an $850 million bank credit line with a group of about 15 banks and other financial institutions led by Chemical Bank, a unit of New York-based Chemical Banking Corp. 

The cellular phone company, which has gas distribution operations in Florida, said the proposed facility consists of a four-year revolving credit and a subsequent six-year term loan, with annual interest running at between prime and prime plus 1.25 percentage points, depending on the balance outstanding. 

The company said the agreement will let it refinance its existing bank facility and vendor financing and complete its merger with Southern Union Co., Dallas.
Metro Mobile said it would immediately draw down about $650 million.
