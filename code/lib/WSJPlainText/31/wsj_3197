Chrysler Corp. put rebates ranging from $300 to $1,000 on several 1990-model cars and continued offering incentives on remaining 1988 and 1989 models. 

The latest incentives, which took effect Saturday, follow discounts by General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. on many of their cars and trucks. 

The new program also follows a truck incentive plan started by Chrysler last month.
The new rebates on 1988 and 1989 models range from $500 on several models to $2,000 on The Eagle Premier LTD sedan.
Chrysler said it will honor higher rebates on the 1988s and 1989s through Thursday. 

The lowest rebate on the 1990 models applies to Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance compact cars.
Chrysler discounted by $1,000 several cars, including the Eagle LTD and fully equipped Dodge Daytonas, Chrysler LeBaron coupes and LeBaron convertibles. 

The incentive program also includes the option of cut-rate financing ranging from 6.9% on 24-month loans to 10.9% on 60-month loans.
