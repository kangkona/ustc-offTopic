The Department of Health and Human Services announced $9 million in grants to community AIDS-treatment programs in 14 cities, a move that will help make the latest AIDS drugs more available to minority populations. 

"The new community programs will make promising investigation drugs more widely available to high-risk populations that have previously been underrepresented in clinical trials," including intravenous drug users, minorities and women at risk, HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan said.
He said that since January 1988, 41% of reported acquired immune deficiency syndrome cases have occurred among minorities. 

The grants represent an expansion in the government's AIDS-treatment research efforts, which have been conducted at the National Institutes of Health and university-based research hospitals.
The programs support clinical research that has been conducted without federal funds by community treatment centers, which generally target homosexuals.
At the same time, the grants are an effort to make some of the latest therapies available to other at-risk populations. 

"These community programs are a way of taking research to the people, and, in this way, involving those who might otherwise have no access to the best AIDS therapies that medicine can offer," explained Dr. James Mason, the acting surgeon general. 

In a speech at the National Press Club last week, Dr. Sullivan praised AIDS activists for pressing the government to accelerate tests and to make promising drugs available more quickly. "AIDS is now near the point where we'll be able to say this is a treatable disease," he said. 

AIDS activists strongly support the government's decision to try to merge sophisticated research and community treatment programs.
However, Dr. Mathilde Krim of the American Foundation for AIDS Research complained that some of the grants slight the needs of gay men in an effort to reach out to minority groups.
