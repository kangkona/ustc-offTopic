Pinnacle West Capital Corp. said it agreed to supply about one million pounds of uranium to Japan Atomic Power Co. of Tokyo in a long-term agreement beginning next year. 

Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed but Pinnacle noted that on Thursday, uranium was selling for about $9.60 a pound and thus the contract would be worth about $10 million.
Pinnacle's Malapi Resources unit has uranium operations in Texas and Wyoming. 

For the second quarter, Pinnacle reported a loss of $11.3 million, compared with year-earlier net income of $43.6 million.
