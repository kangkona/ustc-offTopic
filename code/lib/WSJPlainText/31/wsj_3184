A federal grand jury indicted four former bank loan originators, a real estate developer and a real estate agent with engaging in separate schemes to defraud Comfed Savings Bank, a unit of ComFed Bancorp Inc. and the Salem Five Cents Savings Bank. 

Indicted on charges related to defrauding ComFed were Vincent J. Crupi, Valerie Rydell, Cynthia Lawrenson, all former ComFed loan originators, and Louis R. Pagliuca, a real estate developer. 

Kevin P. Dunne, former loan originator for Salem Five Cents Savings Bank, Salem, Mass., and Randall Golden, a real estate agent were charged with defrauding the Salem Five Cents Savings Bank in a separate indictment. 

All were charged with various counts of bank fraud and making false statements, the U.S. attorney's office in Boston said.
Mr. Pagliuca is also charged with obstruction of justice.
Messrs.
Crupi, Pagliuca, Dunne and Golden were also charged with conspiracy. 

A spokesman for ComFed said the alleged schemes would result in "very little loss" for the Lowell, Mass., holding company. 

Mr. Golden said the indictment "is far beyond me." He said he cooperated with investigators. "They told me they were pulling in a bunch of guys.
They told me they were in no way going after me." Mr. Dunne said the indictment was "unbelievable," but declined to comment further.
Mr. Crupi, Mr. Pagliuca, Ms. Rydell and Ms. Lawrenson couldn't be reached for comment.
