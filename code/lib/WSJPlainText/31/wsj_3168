Qintex Group's ability to complete its $1.5 billion acquisition of MGM/UA Communications Co. was thrown into question after Qintex failed to deliver a $50 million letter of credit. 

The missed deadline was disclosed late last week and persons close to negotiations on the transaction said MGM/UA, as a result, has asked Qintex to deliver a $100 million letter of credit.
These persons said if Qintex doesn't deliver, MGM/UA has indicated it may terminate the acquisition agreement. 

MGM/UA quoted Qintex as saying it "posted security" with a bank to secure the letter of credit, and added that discussions were being held concerning possible changes in the acquisition agreement.
Those changes would concern MGM/UA's receipt of appropriate security from Qintex, but "the discussions do not contemplate a change in the merger price" MGM/UA said in a terse press release. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, MGM/UA closed Friday at $21.875, down 62.5 cents. 

Qintex last month boosted its offer for MGM/UA to $1.5 billion, after Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and Fox Inc. made a surprise $1.4 billion offer that exceeded Qintex's earlier $600 million bid for just part of the studio. 

It couldn't immediately be determined whether the failure to deliver the letter of credit has seriously jeopardized the acquisition agreement, and spokespersons for MGM/UA and Qintex declined all comment on the matter.
However, the announcement is sure to intensify investor concern over Qintex's ability to obtain financing for the acquisition. 

For months, Hollywood has been rife with rumors that Christopher C. Skase, the Australian chairman of Qintex Australia Ltd., which is affiliated with Qintex Group, the acquiring entity, may be having difficulty arranging financing for the deal.
However, Qintex executives have said they expect to complete the acquisition with equity partners and bank financing.
