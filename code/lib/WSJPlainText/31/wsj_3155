Consumer prices in the Netherlands rose a hefty 0.5% in the month to mid-September, the state Central Bureau for Statistics said Friday. 

Prices in general were pushed higher by meats, eggs and potatoes, among other products.
Coffee eased in price. 

Over the 12 months ended in mid-September, consumer prices were up a modest 1.3%, about in line with predictions for the full year. 

The September price gain was steeper than the 0.3% rise a month earlier and the 1.1% year-to-year increase at mid-August.
