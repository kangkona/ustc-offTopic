Italian car sales rose a hefty 11.4% in September from a year earlier, showing none of the signs of the slowdown seen recently in other European auto markets. 

According to figures released Friday by the Italian association of automobile manufacturers, Anfia, a total of 181,913 cars were sold in September, up from 163,417 cars sold in September 1988. 

Anfia also said that car sales rose 8.7% in the first nine months of the year to 1,818,351 from 1,672,337 in the year-earlier period. 

The continued boom in the Italian auto market contrasts with a recent slowdown in the British, West German, Scandanavian and Spanish auto markets.
Analysts attributed the continued sales boom in Italy to the relatively high average age of cars in the country.
In addition, they said, many families are acquiring a second or third car, while other European countries already have more than one car per family on average.
