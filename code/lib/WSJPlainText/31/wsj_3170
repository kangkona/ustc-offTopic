The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said it gave Boston Edison Co., an electric utility, permission to operate its Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station at full power. 

The decision follows a 32-month shutdown of the plant that was criticized by federal regulators. 

The company said the decision was based in part on successful NRC inspections of plant operations and the performance of company management during this time. 

According to the company, the NRC ruled that "the facility is being safely operated and satisfactorily managed." 

The plant, which will begin full-power operations early next week, was closed in April 1986.
