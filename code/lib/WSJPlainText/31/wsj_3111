Xerox Corp. said it is forming a subsidiary to expand its presence in the market for personal-computer software. 

The office-equipment and financial-services company also said it hired Larry J. Gerhard to run the Desktop Software subsidiary.
Mr. Gerhard was chief executive of Decision Data Inc., a large distributor of products and services related to International Business Machines Corp. minicomputers.
Before that, Mr. Gerhard managed development of publishing systems and software at Raytheon Data Systems. 

Xerox has one personal-computer hit: Ventura Publisher, a desktop-publishing package for IBM-compatible machines.
Xerox also has a good prospect in FormBase, an entry into the promising field of forms-processing on personal computers.
FormBase, unlike some other products, makes it easy to send information from the forms to a data base or to grab information from data bases or other programs and have it appear in a form on the screen. 

Xerox said that the products currently generate about $40 million a year in sales and that they are expected to grow 30% to 50% a year.
Mr. Gerhard said the subsidiary will flesh out the product line by doing such things as producing a version of Ventura that can run on Apple Computer Inc. 's Macintosh computer.
He said the unit will also develop or acquire related products, such as graphics packages or so-called desktop-presentation packages, which people typically use to prepare slides or overhead transparencies.
