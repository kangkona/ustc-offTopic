Frustrated in an attempt to be acquired by 3Com Corp., Atlanta-based Digital Communications Associates Inc. appears to be considering an unusual alternative route to a merger. 

A maker of computer networking systems, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based 3Com saw its stock jump 12% after it announced that Digital Communications plans to purchase more than $15 million, but less than 15%, of 3Com's common.
On Friday, in national over-the-counter trading, 3Com stock rose $2.125 to $14.625 a share.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Digital Communications closed at $20.625 a share, up 12.5 cents. 

In a letter to 3Com in August, Digital Communications, a maker of local area networking systems, said it believes 3Com to be a good investment.
The two companies haven't discussed any joint business arrangements, and none is planned, 3Com said. 

Bill Krause, 3Com chairman and chief executive officer, said he talked with Digital Communications after receiving the letter "to make sure they had no interest in a business arrangement." He said 3Com's "only conclusion is that {the intended purchase} is a good use of their cash, and not at all a takeover attempt." He added 3Com doesn't know if Digital Communications has acquired any stock yet. 

Mr. Krause said Digital Communications approached 3Com last November with the idea of having 3Com acquire the company. "It was not an attractive proposition," he said. 

Digital Communications filed notice of its intent to buy 3Com shares under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.
Purchases will be made on the open market through privately negotiated transactions or other means.
