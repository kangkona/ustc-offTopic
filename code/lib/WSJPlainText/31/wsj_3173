The four New York commodity exchanges are negotiating to build a new exchange facility, with sites in New Jersey and lower Manhattan in consideration. 

Newly appointed New York Mercantile Exchange President R. Patrick Thompson said the exchanges are considering two Manhattan sites and one New Jersey site and that both New York City and the state of New Jersey are offering incentives to attract the project.
The project, for about 60,000 square feet, is likely to cost $175 million to $225 million, exchange officials said. 

The exchanges are hoping to have an agreement between them by the end of this year and to move into the facility by the end of 1993.
An earlier effort to build a new, combined trading floor fell through. 

The exchanges -- the New York Merc, the Commodity Exchange of New York (Comex), the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange and the New York Cotton Exchange -- are currently shoe-horned into a space of about 2,500 square feet in the World Trade Center. 

New York Merc Chairman Z. Lou Guttman indicated that the exchange would prefer to stay in New York if possible. "There's a premium we're willing to pay to stay in New York, but it's not a big premium." 

He noted that a joint facility will mean a consolidation of operations.
A merger of the Merc and the Comex has been under consideration for some time.
Mr. Thompson, the Merc president, acknowledged there were continuing informal talks on the merger of the two exchanges.
Last year the Nymex board voted to consider a merger.
