Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum has asked the Justice Department's Antitrust Division to investigate recent distribution practices of movie companies that may be designed to put discount-movie houses out of business. 

The "dollar houses" charge only $1 or $2 a show for a movie in its second run compared with the regular first-run cost of as much as $7.50 a ticket.
A recent Wall Street Journal article said that Paramount Pictures last summer began pushing for a minimum cut of each ticket sold.
If Paramount's policy sticks, it could be copied by other studios and make any ticket price under $3 unlikely. 

Mr. Metzenbaum, chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on antitrust, monopolies and business rights, referred to the Journal's story in his letter and said he was concerned that the distribution changes at Paramount, the film unit of Paramount Communications Inc., "may constitute a back-door effort to force discount theaters to charge higher admission prices." 

Previously, Paramount has said it won't discuss its distribution agreements, but one Paramount official did state that rising production and marketing costs made the price push necessary.
