Norex America Inc. posted net income of $13.5 million in the year ended June 30, including a gain on the sale of its cruise business, compared with a fiscal 1988 loss of $4 million. 

Formerly Bermuda Star Line Inc., Norex America said the earnings from cruise operations and profit from their sale in May contributed about $13 million to the earnings. 

In addition, Christopher H. Shipston, president and a director, resigned from Norex America to rejoin the company that holds 70% of its shares, Norex PLC, as a managing director.
London-based Norex PLC is primarily engaged in marine insurance and financial services. 

"Definitely, in due course the company will designate a president," said Donald L. Caldera, vice chairman of unit. 

Norex America recently purchased stakes in three companies, including two tanker operators and a company that performs technical management of vessels.
Norex America also owns ships, runs charters and operates shipboard casinos. 

Fiscal 1989 revenue declined 7.2% to $55.3 million from the year-earlier $59.6 million.
Per-share net income was $3.07, compared with a year-earlier per-share loss of 93 cents.
Profit from continuing operations rose to $479,000 from $168,000. 

Norex America said it is looking for other investments in maritime and the travel-leisure businesses. 

Norex America continues to own one cruise ship, S.S. Veracruz 1, which it has agreed to sell in May to Rederi AB Effjohn, the company that bought the cruise operations.
Rederi will lease the ship until May.
In fiscal 1990, Norex expects to report a gain of $8.5 million, or $1.93 a share, from the sale and leasing profits.
Rederi is jointly owned by Effoa of Finland, a shipping company, and Johnson Line AB of Sweden.
