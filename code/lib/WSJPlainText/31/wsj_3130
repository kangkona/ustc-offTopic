Temple Holdings Ltd., a company jointly owned by Stena Holding AG and Tiphook PLC, said it extended through Nov. 3 the expiration date on its $63-a-share hostile tender offer for Sea Containers Ltd. 's shares. 

Temple said the offer thus far has the support of "over 50%" of the independent shareholders.
Temple also said it is "confident" that its offer "will prove to be superior to" an alternative that Sea Containers said last week it intends to announce by the end of the month.
Sea Containers is based in Hamilton, Bermuda.
