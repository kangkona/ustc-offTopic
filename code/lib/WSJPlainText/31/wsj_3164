Control Data Corp. said its computer products group won a $365 million, 11-year contract for a global computer network from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 

Control Data said it will begin delivery of its Cyber mainframe computers, network services and support services later this year.
A Honeywell Inc. spokeswoman confirmed that Honeywell was an unsuccessful bidder for the new Corps of Engineers contract, and that the Control Data equipment will be replacing Honeywell mainframe computers. 

Control Data said it will subcontract with the New York-based telecommunications giant American Telephone & Telegraph Co. for the communication network linking the computers.
