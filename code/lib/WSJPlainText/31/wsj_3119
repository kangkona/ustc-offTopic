Amdura Corp. said its bank group, led by Continental Bank, agreed to extend its $40 million bridge loan until Oct. 27.
The loan was due Oct. 6. 

The company said during the next three weeks it will assess its refinancing and repayment options.
The loan was part of the financing for Amdura's acquisition of CoastAmerica in December 1988. 

Amdura has retained Morgan Stanley & Co. to review the possible sale of its Crobsy and Harris businesses to reduce debt.
Amdura is a hardware and automotive distributor.
