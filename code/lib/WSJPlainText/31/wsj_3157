Boeing Co. won half of $3.6 billion in jetliner orders from Taiwan startup Evergreen Airways Corp., as orders continue to roll in even as machinists enter the second week of their strike against the aerospace giant. 

Attempts to resolve the Boeing labor dispute appear at a standstill, with no new negotiations set as of yesterday afternoon.
Boeing's 55,000 machinists walked off the job last week after rejecting the company's latest contract offer, leaving company supervisors and non-striking personnel to put the final touches on about 40 nearly complete jets.
The rest of production has ground to a halt. 

McDonnell Douglas Corp. captured the rest of the order from Evergreen Airways, a subsidiary of Taiwan's Evergreen Group, which is said to be the world's largest container shipping line.
Evergreen Airways is set to begin service in 1992 to the U.S., Europe, the Pacific and Asia. 

Boeing's portion of the order includes six firm orders for four 747-400 jumbo jetliners, which seat as many as 412 passengers, and two extended-range 767-300s, which seat as many as 240.
Evergreen also took options on four additional 747s and two additional 767-300s.
Boeing valued the total order at about $1.9 billion, including spare parts. 

Deliveries of the 767-300s will begin in 1992, and the 747-400s will join the fleet beginning in 1993.
The orders bring Boeing's total firm orders for 747-400s to 221, and orders for 767s of all series to 462. 

McDonnell Douglas's portion includes six firm orders for the new wide-body MD11 trijets, plus options on eight more of the aircraft.
The aircraft, which will be delivered beginning in 1992, will seat 242 passengers each in the configuration that Evergreen has designated.
The orders bring McDonnell Douglas's total firm orders for the MD-11 to 124.
The first flight of an MD11 is expected later this year, with certification to follow next year.
