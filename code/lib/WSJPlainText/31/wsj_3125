A Connecticut Bancorp Inc. shareholder group that recently lost a proxy fight to gain control of the company's board withdrew a lawsuit filed against the bank holding company and some of its officers. 

A spokesman for the group, Artemisia Holdings Inc., led by Peter V. Lathouris, said it will maintain its 6% stake in Connecticut Bancorp.
The group didn't announce any further plans.
