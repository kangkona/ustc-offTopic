Turner Corp. said it sold its F.N. Thompson Inc. construction subsidiary to Polar Construction Corp., a Finnish construction company, and BE&K Inc., an Alabama construction concern. 

Turner, a general builder, said the sale would have "a modest positive impact" on earnings.
The unit, based in Charlotte, N.C., was acquired in 1979. 

A spokeswoman said Turner also owns a subsidiary, based in Washington, D.C., "that covers that area fairly well." The sale "avoids duplication" in Turner's construction activities, she said.
