Knight-Ridder Inc. said its board approved construction of a new production and distribution plant for Philadelphia Newspapers Inc., publisher of the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News. 

The company said the nine-press plant, which will cost $299.5 million and increase color capability, will be located on a 46-acre site in suburban Montgomery County, Pa., about 14 miles from the present plant in Philadelphia.
The plant will begin operations in 1993, the company said.
