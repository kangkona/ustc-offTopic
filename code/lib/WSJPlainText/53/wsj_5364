Shares of Vice President Dan Quayle's family's newspapers apparently will go public at a higher price than underwriters first anticipated. 

While the preliminary prospectus for Central Newspapers Inc. estimated an initial offering price of between $17 and $20, the shares were priced at $21 -- indicating the issue is receiving a warm reception.
Underwriters have been on a road show this week, pitching the issue to prospective buyers. 

Only 3,592,800 of 23,167,000 Class A common shares are being offered to the public.
The majority of Class A and Class B continue to be held by family members.
All of the estimated $75 million in proceeds would go to selling shareholders. 

The vice president isn't among those offering shares for sale.
Other selling shareholders include DePauw University, his alma mater. 

Central Newspapers publishes daily newspapers in Indianapolis and Phoenix, Ariz., as well as several in smaller Indiana markets.
