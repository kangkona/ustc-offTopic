Striking workers halted production at the Peugeot S.A. auto plant yesterday as management and union activists appeared to harden their positions in the two-week pay dispute against the French auto maker. 

Between 600 and 800 strikers blocked access roads to Peugeot's plant at Mulhouse in eastern France with barricades and burning tires, witnesses said, preventing nonstrikers from going to work. 

The assembly lines were shut down because "they are missing workers," a Peugeot spokesman said.
The plant employs 12,000 workers. 

Four unions representing metalworkers at Mulhouse and Peugeot's plant in nearby Sochaux went on strike Sept. 5 to force the company into negotiations over a pay plan to take effect Oct. 1.
