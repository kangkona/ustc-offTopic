In spite of their own opposition to the plan, governors of the National Association of Securities Dealers Inc. agreed to observe a system of marketwide trading halts in certain situations for one more year. 

The NASD oversees the over-the-counter stock market. 

"The NASD continues to believe," said its president, Joseph R. Hardiman, "that individual markets, in cooperation with other markets and federal regulators, should be free to make a determination of whether to close based on the character of a particular emergency." 

The plan of establishing "circuit breakers" to close U.S. securities markets in case of extreme price volatility was developed in response to the Oct. 19, 1987, market crash, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 538 points, or 22.6%, and most equities markets around the world suffered similar losses. 

"In the spirit of intermarket cooperation," the NASD said it agreed to abide by "circuit-breaker" procedures put in place by the Securities and Exchange Commission until Oct. 31, 1990.
