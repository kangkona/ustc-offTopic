Saint Mark's Bookshop said it had arranged temporary financial help, allowing it to stay in business.
The store's financial problems were the subject of a recent Wall Street Journal story. 

The store said Robert Rodale, president of book publisher Rodale Press Inc., Emmaus, Pa., had lent Saint Mark's $50,000 to restock inventory.
Negotiations for long-term financing, involving Mr. Rodale's acquisition of a minority interest in the store, are in progress, Robert Contant, a Saint Mark's partner, added.
