The United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners said it expects to lose nearly half of the $95 million it invested in six real-estate deals and is suing its financial advisers for negligence. 

Union officials said the loss won't affect its member services or its general stability because the money came from a $200 million investment fund that was part of its general treasury, but doesn't include pension assets. 

Union President Sigurd Lucassen said the union made six commercial real-estate loans in 1985 and 1986 at the recommendation of its advisers, including a waterfront complex in Baltimore, condominiums in Nyack, N.Y., and projects in Florida, Indiana, Illinois and Pennsylvania.
Only the Illinois loan didn't go into default. 

"We're taking every step necessary to stabilize the situation," Mr. Lucassen said earlier this week.
He said although the loans, authorized by his predecessor, Patrick Campbell, were made in good faith, he doesn't believe the union should make direct real-estate loans. 

The carpenters union is suing Empire Contract Consulting of New York and its two principals, Paul Adler and Stanley Burns, for failing to properly analyze the investments and advise the union on the loans' performance.
The suit, filed in Superior Court for the District of Columbia, seeks compensation for the union's losses and court costs. 

Union officials said they'll revise their financial reports to reflect an expected loss of $45 million on the real-estate deals. 

Empire's attorney, Ira Sporkin, told the Associated Press that his clients deny the allegations and that the company was being drawn into an internal dispute between Messrs.
Lucassen and Campbell. 

Mr. Lucassen said that although the loans began having problems in 1987, the union continued to receive positive reports from Empire.
Earlier this year, the union learned the loans were having problems and hired outside experts to examine them.
