Hudson General Corp. said it expects to post losses for the quarter and year ended June 30.
It blamed the sale of the rest of its aircraft spare-parts inventory; it also cited plans to sell its equity in a Canadian air-freight transportation company. 

Sale of the aircraft spare parts resulted in a $2.8 million charge to earnings in the quarter, Hudson said.
Sale of the equity interest will result in a "significant charge" but the amount hasn't been determined, it added. 

In fiscal 1988, net income was $310,000, or 25 cents a share, on revenue of $120 million. 

Hudson General provides services to airlines, airport operators and the general aviation community and is in a joint venture to develop 4,000 acres in Hawaii.
