AEG AG said group sales rose 12% to 7.4 billion marks ($3.79 billion) in the January-August period of 1989 from the yearearlier period. 

The Frankfurt-based electric unit of Daimler-Benz AG said it expects sales to rise "clearly over 12 billion" marks in 1989, from 11.5 billion marks in 1988.
The 1988 turnover excludes sales in the high-frequency, marine and special-technology units. 

AEG also said it expects group operating profit to remain at last year's level of 115 million marks. 

AEG also said its subsidiary Telefunken Electronic has taken a 50% stake in Matra-Harris Semiconductors S.A. 

The stake in Matra-Harris, which is a joint electronics venture between French concern Matra S.A. and the U.S-based Harris Corp., will expand AEG's microelectronics sector, in which the group had sales of 1.3 billion marks in 1988.
