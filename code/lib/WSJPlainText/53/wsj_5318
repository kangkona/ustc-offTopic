Toyota Motor Corp. said it is considering importing Camry model cars made by its subsidiary in the U.S. 

Although officials at Japan's largest auto maker say it will be some time before a decision is made, there is speculation that Toyota may start importing several hundred cars a month in mid-1990. 

Already, Honda Motor Co. and Mazda Motor Corp. have been importing cars made by their U.S. subsidiaries. 

The growing effort among Japanese auto makers to sell imports through their distribution networks is part of a government-encouraged bid to expand overall imports and cut the nation's hugh trade surplus.
