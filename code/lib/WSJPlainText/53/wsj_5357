A major shareholder has joined a legal battle opposing Occidental Petroleum Corp. 's plans to spend about $86 million on a museum for Chairman Armand Hammer's art. 

In a filing with the Delaware Court of Chancery, the California Public Employees Retirement System asked to intervene in existing litigation that seeks to block Occidental's funding of the museum.
It also demands the return of art owned by the Armand Hammer Foundation and allegedly bought indirectly with corporate funds, and asks the court to cut off Mr. Hammer's salary. 

The California retirement system, the nation's second-largest pension fund, holds about two million of Occidental's 269 million common shares.
It called Occidental's outlays for the museum "unreasonable and a waste of Occidental's assets" that provide "no corresponding benefit for Occidental." 

The litigation was initiated by Alan R. Kahn, a New York investment manager, on behalf of the relatively small holding of Occidental stock for which Mr. Kahn is trustee.
The proposed intervention of the California retirement system appears to give weight to Mr. Kahn's position that Occidental shareholders don't support the project. 

A court spokesman said a hearing date hasn't been set on the California retirement system's motion to intervene. 

A spokesman for Occidental declined to comment on the filing but noted that the California retirement system has once before presented an affadavit in the case in support of Mr. Kahn.
