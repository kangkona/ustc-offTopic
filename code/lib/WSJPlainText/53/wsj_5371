Campeau Corp. said it may have to buy back about $415 million of convertible debentures, including about one-third of Olympia & York Developments Ltd. 's stake in Campeau, after the planned restructuring of Campeau is completed. 

The move appears designed to protect O&Y's original investment in Campeau. 

Under agreements with O&Y, Campeau will, if requested by O&Y, offer to buy back two series of Campeau debentures, Campeau said.
The buy-back, at par plus accrued interest, would occur within 12 months after the planned restructuring of Campeau and its subsidiaries is completed.
O&Y is an investment holding and real-estate concern owned by Toronto's Reichmann brothers. 

Campeau would offer to repurchase all of its 184 million Canadian dollars (US$155 million) of 7.5% convertible debentures, Series A, and all of its US$260 million of 7% convertible debentures. 

At last report, O&Y held C$46.6 million of the Series A debt, convertible into 1.48 million shares, and all of the 7% debt, convertible into 10 million shares.
The Campeau debt held by O&Y is convertible into stock representing about one-third of O&Y's 38.4% fully diluted stake in Campeau.
Campeau Chairman Robert Campeau's fully diluted stake in Campeau is currently 43.2%. 

Campeau said the aggregate amount needed to buy back the debentures can't exceed the net proceeds received by Campeau and its subsidiaries from the restructuring.
O&Y has agreed to lend Campeau US$250 million to help it meet liquidity needs, and will supervise a major refinancing and restructuring of Campeau and its subsidiaries, which include Bloomingdale's and other department store chains. 

Campeau said its agreement with O&Y regarding the restructuring will be in effect for two years and may be extended to about four years. 

Ross Cowan, an analyst with Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc., said the buy-back agreement appears to be a "safety clause" for O&Y's earlier investment in Campeau, if Campeau's stock price doesn't improve after the restructuring. 

"It looks like a backstop for O&Y to protect their original capital in the convertible debentures," Mr. Cowan said. 

The Series A debt is convertible into Campeau stock at C$31.50 a share, and the 7% debt is convertible at US$26 a share.
In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Campeau closed at C$15.125, up 87.5 cents, on volume of 1.2 million shares.
