Occidental Petroleum Corp. 's Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America unit received clearance from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a $108 million project to connect its two pipeline systems at points in southern Oklahoma and northeastern Texas. 

Construction is scheduled to begin immediately and to be completed by early next year. "The interconnect will give our interstate transmission company the flexibility to balance gas flows in its two mainline systems and help meet the urgent need for increased pipeline capacity to move gas out of Oklahoma," said Armand Hammer, Occidental's chairman and chief executive officer.
Capacity of the new pipeline system will be about 350 million cubic feet of gas a day, Occidental said.
