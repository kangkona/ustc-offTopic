T. Boone Pickens Jr. said he agreed to buy another 10 million shares of Koito Manufacturing Co., stepping up his campaign for more influence in the Japanese auto-parts maker. 

Mr. Pickens said the purchase would increase the Koito stake held by Boone Co., his merchant-banking firm, to about 42.4 million shares, or about 26% of the shares outstanding, up from 20%.
He expects the transaction to be completed in 30 days.
Terms weren't disclosed.
The shares are being purchased in a private transaction from Azabu Group of Japan, which is controlled by Kitaro Watanabe, a wealthy investor with extensive real estate and automobile dealership holdings. 

The Texas-based corporate raider said he hasn't any plans to take over the company, "but we do want to participate in the management of Koito and share in its long-term success." Mr. Pickens said the company "will not succeed in keeping us out." 

Koito officials couldn't immediately be reached for comment. 

Mr. Pickens, Koito's largest shareholder, has been jousting with the Japanese company for months.
Earlier this week, he asked Koito to increase its interim dividend. 

Mr. Pickens said he plans to ask for a special shareholders meeting at which he would again press a request for three board seats.
There were reports from Japan that Koito has scheduled a special meeting for Nov. 11.
