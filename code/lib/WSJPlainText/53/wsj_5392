The Mexican government unveiled a plan to cede control of its notoriously inefficient 56%-owned telephone monopoly to private investors, who would carry out an ambitious expansion to double Mexico's telephone lines within four years. 

Under the long-awaited privatization scheme, the biggest step yet in the government's program to shed publicly held companies, Mexican investors would maintain majority control of the monopoly, Telefonos de Mexico, or Telmex.
Foreign investors, who currently own 25% of the company through depository receipts traded over-the-counter, would be permitted to expand their holdings to up to 49%.
No single foreign investor would be permitted a more than 10% stake of the company. 

Mexican officials said investors in the U.S., Japan and Europe have expressed interest in the plan. 

The government's four-year expansion strategy includes doubling the number of phone lines to 20 per 100 inhabitants from about 10 per 100 and bringing phone service to every town of more than 500 people.
The expansion would cost about $10 billion, $7 billion of which would be generated within the company and the rest from new investors. 

The government said it might later open certain telephone services to competition.
It mentioned as possibilities services in isolated tourist zones and industrial parks.
