Chairman Charles J. Urstadt, 60 years old, adds the posts of president and chief executive officer of the real estate investment trust.
In the two added posts, he succeeds William F. Murdoch, 58, who takes the title of vice chairman.
Mr. Urstadt, HRE's largest holder with 13%, said the board made the appointment as the company addresses a threatened proxy fight from Kimco Development Corp., a Roslyn, N.Y., shopping-center developer.
Mr. Urstadt has been on HRE's board since 1975 and has been chairman since 1986.
