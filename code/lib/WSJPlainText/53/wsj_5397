NEC Corp., a top Japanese manufacturer of computers and semiconductors, announced it will produce personal computers with color liquid crystal displays at one of its U.S. subsidiary plants. 

A decision is still pending on which subsidiary. 

NEC also hasn't decided when to launch its U.S.-based production.
A spokesman said a decision on the starting date will be made within a year. 

The new computer, called the "PC9801LX5C," was introduced inside Japan in late August and is characterized as the first personal computer with a color liquid crystal display to be commercialized in the world. 

The product is designed for lap-top use and displays information in eight colors. 

Production is expected to help expand the company's business in the U.S. where its share in the personal computer market is about 5%, compared with its more than 50% share of the Japanese personal computer market.
