I find it necessary to challenge a very misleading story on Sept. 13 about my agency, Campbell-Mithun-Esty (CME).
The headline, "Saatchi Is Fighting Loser Image at Campbell-Mithun-Esty Unit," and the story that accompanies it imply that CME as a whole is encountering difficulties. 

Unfortunately, this coverage perpetuates a certain predisposition toward filing stories about the U.S. advertising industry from a predominantly New York City perspective.
While our New York office has gone through several disappointing developments of late, the impact of these changes on CME's system as a whole is quite limited.
In fact, our billings are up 8% for the year. 

Campbell-Mithun-Esty is an $850 million agency with full-service offices in seven markets throughout the U.S. and Canada, and with field-service locations in 22 other markets.
Our operations are geographically dispersed to capitalize on the realities of consumer behaviors and attitudes throughout North America.
