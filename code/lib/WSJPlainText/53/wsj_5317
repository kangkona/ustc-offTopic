Net income of the Philippines' San Miguel Corp. reached 1.4 billion pesos ($65.4 million) during the first half of the year, up 40% from one billion pesos a year earlier. 

A publicly listed food and beverage concern, San Miguel said net sales rose 12% to 11.4 billion pesos from 10.2 billion pesos. 

However, the company expects a slower increase in net for the rest of the year.
San Miguel said in a report to its stockholders that higher wages, production costs, and interest rates threaten growth prospects for the second half. 

San Miguel cited the economic slowdown here and in the U.S., as well as more liberal trade policies affecting the domestic manufacturing and marketing sectors.
The U.S. is the Philippines' principal trading partner, the company noted. 

It said a proposed bill in Congress to substantially increase taxes on cigarettes and beer, once passed, would seriously cut demand and depress revenue and profits, and undermine the company's ongoing expansion program.
