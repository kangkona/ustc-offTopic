People who use "extended-wear" soft contact lenses have a several times greater risk of developing a serious eye infection than people who take out their lenses every night. 

The high risk of ulcerative keratitis among users of extended-wear contact lenses was uncovered by two studies sponsored by the industry-supported Contact Lens Institute and carried out by ophthalmologists at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and Harvard Medical School.
About four million of the estimated 13 million Americans who wear contact lenses use the extended-wear type. 

The results of the studies, published in this week's New England Journal of Medicine, were given to the Food and Drug Administration last spring.
In June, the FDA and the contact lens industry cautioned consumers and opticians that extended-wear lenses shouldn't be worn continuously for more than seven days.
Previously, they had been thought safe to wear continuously for as long as 30 days. 

One study found that if users of extended-wear lenses wore them overnight, the risk of the keratitis was 10 to 15 times higher than for users of the daily-wear types of lenses.
Even a person who tended to wear daily-wear lenses overnight ran a ninefold higher risk of keratitis compared with those who removed their lenses every night. 

The study indicated strongly that it was the lack of daily cleaning of the lenses that led to keratitis.
