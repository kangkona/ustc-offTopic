Farmers Group Inc. said a federal judge in Arizona denied an attempt by Sir James Goldsmith to block the Arizona insurance department from reviewing his unfriendly #13.4 billion bid (US $20.8 billion) for B.A.T Industries PLC, parent of Farmers. 

The Arizona court's rejection of Sir James's request for an injunction, follows rejections by Kansas, Idaho, California, Washington and Texas.
Sir James and his Hoylake Investments Ltd. filed lawsuits in federal courts in the nine states where Farmers has operations seeking to block the insurance commissions there from reviewing his offer for B.A.T, a London-based tobacco, retailing, paper and financial services concern. 

Hoylake has appealed the denials in several of the states and plans to appeal in the rest.
The request for an injunction is pending in Illinois, Ohio and Oregon.
