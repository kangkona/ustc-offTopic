Cetus Corp. said the French government gave it approval to market its Proleukin interleukin-2 anti-cancer drug as a treatment for kidney cancer. 

The move is a shot in the arm for the biotechnology concern, which has had heavy losses while developing the drug and other products.
France is the fourth and largest European Community country to approve the marketing of the experimental drug, known as IL-2.
The other countries are Ireland, the Netherlands and Denmark. 

Cetus said it expects to begin distributing the drug in France within the next several weeks, after Cetus and a committee of several EC country officials negotiate a price for IL-2.
Cetus declined to discuss how much it hopes to charge for the drug.
It said an estimated 9,400 people are treated for kidney cancer in France each year. 

Cetus expects the remaining eight EC countries to approve marketing of IL-2 within the next six months.
The company applied for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in November and expects to receive it in the first half of 1990.
