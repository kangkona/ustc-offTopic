CHARIOT GROUP Inc. directors omitted the quarterly dividend for the fourth quarter, to devote resources to "future acquisition activity." The New York home-building products and metal fabricating company last paid an eight-cent dividend on July 25.
In January, it declared a one-time dividend of 50 cents a share after selling its Sandusky Plastics Inc. subsidiary, and boosted the quarterly payout to eight cents a share from six cents.
Robert Saba, treasurer, said the omission for the latest quarter would save about $200,000.
For future quarters, he said, the board will "take it one step at a time.
We want to send a message that we're on top of our costs and expenses and looking for other opportunities." The company is 75%-owned by its chairman, Richard Gray.
