United Airlines parent UAL Corp. said it will reimburse an employee-management group as much as $120 million for its expenses for a pending $6.8 billion buy-out, even if the offer is topped. 

If the $300-a-share offer is topped within two weeks of the takeover accord dated Sept. 14, the buyers will receive up to $80 million.
After that, they would receive a total of as much as $120 million. 

The expenses represent "breakup" or "lockup" fees of 1.8% or 1.2% that would make the purchase more expensive for another bidder.
The fees include payments to banks, investment banks, lawyers, accountants and the pilots union. 

The total doesn't include fees the banks will receive when the purchase closes with the help of $7.2 billion in bank loans.
They do include $16 million to reimburse a fund created by the pilots union for its first bid in 1987. 

Takeover stock traders said the fees are on the high side, even for a complex transaction with three parties sharing the purchase.
Those are the pilots union, United executives, and British Airways PLC. 

The agreement disclosing the expense totals didn't give a breakdown.
Lazard Freres & Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc. advised the pilots, and Morgan Stanley & Co. advised British Air.
Some details may be contained in a formal offer to be made public today.
