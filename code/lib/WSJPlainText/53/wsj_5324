Texaco Inc. agreed to move its London headquarters to Canary Wharf, Olympia & York Developments Ltd. 's huge office project in the derelict dockyards of East London. 

The White Plains, N.Y., oil giant is only the second tenant to agree to take space in the $7 billion, 71-acre development since the closely held Toronto-based real estate concern bought it in 1987.
In March, Merrill Lynch & Co. agreed to move its London headquarters there when the project's first phase is completed in 1991. 

Two other companies, Morgan Stanley Inc. and Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd., were part of a consortium that conceived the project but later sold most of its interest to Olympia & York. 

Texaco's 25-year lease calls for it to move its 850 employees from the elegant Knightsbridge section to a 200,000-square-foot building at the western end of the project.
Terms weren't disclosed.
Texaco expects to move in mid-1992. 

The agreement brings the total office space taken in Canary Wharf to 1,440,000 square feet, less than 15% of the 10 million square feet planned.
A 400-bedroom hotel, restaurants, shops, parking and recreational facilities are planned to raise the total to 12 million square feet.
Olympia & York says the project could take a decade to complete.
