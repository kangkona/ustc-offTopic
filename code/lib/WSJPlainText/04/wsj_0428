Japan's exports of cars, trucks and buses declined 2.4% to 535,322 units in September from a year earlier, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said. 

The association attributed the drop to a trend among auto makers to move manufacturing operations overseas.
With the exception of August, when exports rose 2.1%, exports have declined every month from year-earlier levels since March.
