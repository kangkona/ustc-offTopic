Fluor Corp. said it was awarded a $300 million contract to provide engineering and construction-management services at a copper mine in Irian Jaya, Indonesia, for a unit of Freeport-McMoRan Copper Co. 

Fluor, based in Irvine, Calif., will direct expansion of the mine's capacity to 52,000 metric tons a day from 32,000 metric tons a day.
Completion of the project is expected by mid-1992. 

In 1988, Fluor had revenue of $5.1 billion and earnings of $56.4 million, or 71 cents a share.
