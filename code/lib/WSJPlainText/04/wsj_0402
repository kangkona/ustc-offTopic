Rymer Foods Inc. said its board authorized the purchase of as many as 500,000 of its common stock purchase warrants at a price of $4 a warrant. 

The food company, which has 720,000 warrants and about 2.9 million common shares outstanding, said it may increase the offer to purchase any or all warrants that are properly tendered.

The warrants expire on Oct. 15, 1992, and may be called by the company at a price of $5.25. 

The offer is scheduled to expire on Nov. 28, unless extended.
