Cetus Corp. said the government of Spain approved the marketing of its Proleukin interleukin-2 drug to treat kidney cancer. 

The biotechnology concern said Spanish authorities must still clear the price for the treatment, but that it expects to receive such approval by year end.
Four other countries in Europe have approved Proleukin in recent months.
Cetus is currently trying to obtain federal regulatory clearance for U.S. distribution.
