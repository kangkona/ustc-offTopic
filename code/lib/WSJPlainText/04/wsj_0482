Mercury Savings & Loan Association, Huntington Beach, Calif., reported a third-quarter loss of $3.9 million, or 61 cents a share, compared with net income of $1.4 million, or 22 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. 

Mercury attributed the loss to rapid prepayments of loans and costs incurred in refinancing many house loans this past spring and summer, when interest rates dipped. 

The thrift hired an investment banker earlier this month to advise it regarding a possible sale or merger.
Mercury also is shrinking itself, part of its plan to change its emphasis from buying mortgage loans from mortgage brokers to making loans directly.
Such a focus is "more profitable, more efficient and gives us a greater sense of control," said William A. Shane, Mercury's senior executive vice president.
As of Sept. 30, Mercury's assets were $2.25 billion, down from $2.62 billion a year ago. 

For the nine months, Mercury posted a loss of $5.4 million, or 86 cents share, against net income of $4 million, or 63 cents share, a year earlier. 

Mercury shares closed yesterday at $4.625, up 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
