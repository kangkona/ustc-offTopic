Seasonal Stackup 

Air-traffic problems, though 

often quite grim, 

This time of year leave us in 

stitches, 

When we notice around our 

airport 

A holding pattern for 

witches. 

-- Edward F. Dempsey. 

Double-Jointed 

"I am beside myself," 

I've said in moments of 

heat, 

Without ever bothering To marvel at the feat. 

-- Joshua Adams. 

Humility Helper 

The ultimate blow to the ego 

is learning that even your 

mistakes go unnoticed. 

-- Ivern Ball.
