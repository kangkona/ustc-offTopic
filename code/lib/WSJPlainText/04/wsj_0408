Warner Communications Inc. is close to an agreement to back a new recorded music and music publishing company in partnership with Irving Azoff, who resigned in September as head of MCA Inc. 's MCA Records unit. 

Warner and Mr. Azoff declined comment, as did MCA, where Mr. Azoff had also been discussing such a venture.
But record industry executives familiar with the talks said Mr. Azoff and Warner came to an agreement yesterday to form a 50-50 joint-venture company funded by Warner and run by Mr. Azoff.
Among other things, they said, Mr. Azoff would develop musical acts for a new record label. 

The agreement is said to be similar to Warner's 50-50 partnership with record and movie producer David Geffen, whose films and records are distributed by the Warner Bros. studio and the Warner records unit.
Although Mr. Azoff won't produce films at first, it is possible that he could do so later, the sources said. 

Like Mr. Geffen's arrangement, the venture gives Mr. Azoff a link to the world's largest and most successful record distributor; in the U.S. alone, Warner has a 40% share of the market, about double its nearest competitor, Sony Corp. 's CBS Records.
For Warner, meanwhile, it gives the company a second young partner with a finger on the pulse of the hottest trends in the music business. 

The 41-year-old Mr. Azoff, a former rock `n' roll manager, is credited with turning around MCA's once-moribund music division in his six years at the company.
But Mr. Azoff had been negotiating for more than a year to get out of his MCA contract, which expired in 1991.
Mr. Azoff reportedly was bored and frequently clashed with top MCA management over a number of issues such as compensation and business plans. 

Mr. Azoff also was eager to return to a more entrepreneurial role in which he had a big financial stake in his own efforts.
In an interview at the time of his resignation from MCA, he said: "I'd rather build a company than run one."
