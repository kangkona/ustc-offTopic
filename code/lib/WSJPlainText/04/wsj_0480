MiniScribe Corp., Longmont, Colo., said it introduced a one-inch high, 80-megabyte hard disk drive that it hopes will prove popular with makers of high-performance laptop and portable computers. 

The troubled disk drive maker aims with the new 3 1/2-inch disks to revive its reputation and sales growth.
MiniScribe said the disk drives have more memory capacity than other disks that size. 

MiniScribe said it expects to begin full volume production of the drives in the U.S. and Singapore in the first quarter next year.
A drive with 120 megabytes of capacity is scheduled for release during the third quarter of 1990. 

MiniScribe has been on the rocks since it disclosed early this year that its earnings reports for 1988 weren't accurate.
After an internal investigation, the company found that senior officials used a variety of schemes to fabricate sales gains, including counting shipments of bricks and defective drives as sales.
