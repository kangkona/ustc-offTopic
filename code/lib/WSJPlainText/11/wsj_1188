Directors of Bergen Bank and Den Norske Creditbank, two of Norway's leading banks, announced they had agreed to the formal merger of the banks. 

The merger would create Scandinavia's seventh largest bank, with combined assets of 210 billion Norwegian kroner ($30.3 billion). 

The banks said an application for a concession to merge into one entity to be called Den Norske Bank AS was sent Monday to the Finance Ministry. 

The two boards said in a joint statement that the proposed merger agreement was considered in separate board meetings in Oslo Monday. 

They said the agreement will be submitted to their respective supervisory boards next Wednesday.
Extraordinary general meetings, to be held Nov. 28, will decide the share exchange ratio. 

The merger requires the approval of Norwegian authorities.
