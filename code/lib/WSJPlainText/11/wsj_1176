Dunkin' Donuts Inc., battling a takeover proposal by Canada's DD Acquisition Corp., said that its directors will evaluate takeover offers submitted by Nov. 10. 

Dunkin' Donuts, based in Randolph, Mass., previously said it would explore "alternatives," including a leveraged buy-out of the company, but hadn't set a date for submission of proposals. 

Dunkin' Donuts Chairman and Chief Executive Robert M. Rosenberg said "a sale is one alternative being considered," but he added the board hasn't decided whether to sell the doughnut franchiser. 

DD Acquisition, jointly owned by Unicorp Canada Corp. 's Kingsbridge Capital Group unit and Cara Operations Ltd., has made a $45-a-share tender offer valued at $268 million for Dunkin' Donuts. 

Dunkin' Donuts' announcement followed DD Acquisition's request to the Delaware Court of Chancery Monday to set a trial date for its suit against the company.
The trial had been postponed to allow Dunkin' Donuts to seek alternatives to DD Acquisition's offer.
