Applied Solar Energy Corp. of City of Industry, Calif., said it and its majority shareholder, American Cyanamid Co., signed a non-binding letter of intent for the acquisition of Applied Solar by McDonnell Douglas Corp. for about $38 million. 

The proposed acquisition provides for a cash payment of $10 a share at closing and a contingent payment of as much as 80 cents a share placed in escrow.
Details of the escrow agreement haven't been completed, the companies said.
There are 3.5 million shares of Applied Solar, of which American Cyanamid owns 2.7 million.
American Cyanamid is a Wayne, N.J., chemicals, drugs and fertilizer concern. 

Completion of the acquisition is subject to execution of a definitive agreement, approval by all three companies' boards and the approval of Applied Solar's shareholders.
An Applied Solar spokesman said completion is expected at the end of the year or early next year. 

A spokeswoman for the St. Louis aerospace and defense concern said it wanted the acquistion because Applied Solar is involved in solar cells and solid-state laser components, and this fits with McDonnell's business of laser applications for military space.
