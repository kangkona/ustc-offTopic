"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous" may be visiting some new venues in the near future.
Judge Robert ("Maximum Bob") Potter sentenced Jim Bakker to 45 years in the big house yesterday, while a Beverly Hills judge tucked away Zsa Zsa Gabor for three days, plus 120 hours of work with homeless women.

Mr. Bakker said he was guilty of sin but not fraud.
We can only wonder who will be the next lost soul chosen to be America's Celebrity Convict.
