Lion Nathan Ltd. agreed to buy the franchise to bottle, distribute and market Pepsi-Cola soft-drink products in Australia, the company said. 

The New Zealand brewing and retail concern didn't disclose terms. 

The agreement is effective Jan. 1 and is subject to approval from Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board. 

Cadbury Schweppes Australia Ltd. has held the Australian Pepsi franchise for the past four years.
Lion Nathan and PepsiCola Australia, a unit of PepsiCo Inc. of the U.S., didn't say why Cadbury Schweppes will no longer hold the franchise.
