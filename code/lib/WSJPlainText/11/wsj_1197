Homestake Mining Co., San Francisco, blamed the continued slump in gold prices for an 83% plunge in third-quarter net income to $2 million, or two cents a share, from $11.2 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier. 

Revenue rose 5% to $110.4 million from $105.4 million. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Homestake closed at $15.25, down 25 cents. 

"A significant increase in gold sales to 248,279 ounces for the quarter from 188,726 in the third quarter of 1988 was more than offset by the continued decline in average gold price realization to $367 from $429 per ounce," the company said. 

For the nine months, the mining company posted a 40% drop in profit to $30.1 million, or 31 cents a share, from $50.6 million, or 52 cents a share, on a 6% rise in revenue to $323.2 million from $305.7 million.
