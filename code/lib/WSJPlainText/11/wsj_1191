The Federal Trade Commission said it authorized its staff to seek a preliminary injunction barring Imo Industries Inc. from acquiring the shares outstanding of the U.S. unit of the British company, United Scientific Holdings PLC, for $69 million. 

The FTC said it "had reason to believe that the proposed acquisition could substantially reduce competition" in the production of certain image intensifier tubes, which are important components of night-vision devices sold primarily to the defense industry. 

The FTC said it would seek to enjoin the proposed acquisition in a federal trial court, but declined to specify which one.
Under federal law, if the court grants a preliminary injunction, the FTC must begin administrative proceedings to determine the legality of the proposed stock purchase within 20 days. 

Officials at the United Scientific unit, Optic-Electronic Corp. of Garland, Texas, and at Imo Industries of Lawrenceville, N.J., couldn't be reached for comment.
