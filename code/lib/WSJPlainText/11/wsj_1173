Vickers PLC, a British aerospace, defense and automotive conglomerate, said it reached an agreed cash bid of #108.2 million ($173.3 million) for Ross Catherall Group PLC, a maker of specialty alloy and ceramics. 

The company said it expects to receive acceptances for its offer of 253 pence ($4.05) per share representing at least 67% of Ross Catherall's issued share capital, or 12.7 million ordinary shares. 

Vickers said its offer also includes an option to receive a redeemable loan note in lieu of cash.
The notes can be redeemed starting in July 1991. 

The company said its acquisition of Ross Catherall will be covered largely by cash raised in its July disposal of Howson-Algraphy for #241.7 million.
