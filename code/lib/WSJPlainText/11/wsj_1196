Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc., Grosse Pointe Shores, Mich., estimated it will sell about as many cars in 1990 as the 75,000 it expects to deliver this year. 

Mercedes officials said they expect flat sales next year even though they see the U.S. luxury-car market expanding slightly.
Erich Krampe, president of the U.S. sales arm of West German auto maker Daimler Benz AG, predicted luxury-car sales will rise to 840,000 in 1990 from 830,000 this year primarily because of the new Japanese makes. 

Most of the growth, he said, will come in the $35,000-to-$50,000 price range, where Mercedes has a 35% U.S. market share.
Mercedes sold 82,348 cars in 1988. 

Mr. Krampe also said that Mercedes plans to bring out new models every year through the mid-1990s and it will shorten its product development cycle to eight years from 10 or 12 years to compete more effectively with Toyota Motor Corp. 's Lexus, Nissan Motor Co. 's Infiniti and Honda Motor Co. 's Acura luxury-car divisions.
