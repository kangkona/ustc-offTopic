Combustion Engineering Inc. said third-quarter net income of $22.8 million, reversing a $91.7 million year-earlier loss. 

The Stamford, Conn., power-generation products and services company said per-share earnings were 56 cents compared with the year-ago loss of $2.39.
Sales fell 1.5% to $884 million from $897.2 million. 

Strong profit in the process industries, including chemical and pulp and paper, were offset by higher interest expense and by lower earnings as the company closed out certain long-term contracts. 

Combustion reported improved profits in its automation and control products businesses, and it narrowed its losses in its public sector and environmental segment.
Power generation had higher sales but lower earnings; the company cited factors including work on certain low profit-margin contracts from previous years. 

Net in the latest quarter included a pretax gain of $22.4 million from the sale of Combustion's minority interest in Stein Industrie to GEC Alsthom N.V. of the Netherlands.
Last year's results reflected a gain of $28.2 million on disposition of assets and a $165 million pretax provision mainly from costs of completing certain waste-to-energy and other power plants.
