Wang Laboratories Inc. has sold $25 million of assets and reached agreements in principle to sell an additional $187 million shortly, Richard Miller, president, said at the annual meeting. 

He said Wang had reached an agreement with a "major financial firm" to sell for $150 million its domestic equipment lease portfolio and that of its Wang Credit Corp. subsidiary.
He said it also agreed to sell a portion of its European real estate unit for $37 million. 

Mr. Miller said that Wang has already sold some $12 million of miscellaneous assets and disclosed that it had received $13 million from Compaq Computer Corp., Houston, in the previously announced sale of its Stirling, Scotland, plant. 

Mr. Miller repeated that in the next six months he plans to sell another $200 million to $300 million of assets to repay debt and reduce interest costs at Wang, a minincomputer maker in Lowell, Mass. 

In response to questions after the annual meeting, Mr. Miller said the company is no longer looking for an equity investor.
During the summer, Wang executives had said they might seek outside investment.
