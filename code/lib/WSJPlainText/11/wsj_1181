Bank of Montreal said it added 850 million Canadian dollars (US$725.8 million) to its reserves against losses on Third World loans, bringing the total it has set aside this year to C$1 billion. 

The bank said the C$1 billion in reserves will result in a charge of C$595 million against earnings but said it still expects to report a profit for the year ending Tuesday.
The bank reported net income of C$389 million for the nine months ended July 31.
The bank said the increase in loan-loss provisions won't affect the payment of dividends. 

The bank said reserves now amount to 61% of its total less-developed-country exposure.
Excluding Mexico, reserves equal 95% of LDC exposure. 

In Toronto Stock Exchange trading, Bank of Montreal closed at C$33.25, up 87.5 Canadian cents.
