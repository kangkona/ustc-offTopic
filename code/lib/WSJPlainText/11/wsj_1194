International Business Machines Corp. agreed to acquire a 15% stake in Paxus Corp., an Australian computer-software and information-services concern, for 20 million Australian dollars (US$17 million). 

The investment will be made through IBM Australia Ltd., a unit of IBM, the two companies said yesterday. 

IBM can raise its stake in Paxus to 20% over three years, but agreed to not go beyond 20% in that time. 

Paxus said in a statement it has several "well developed product and services relationships" with the U.S. computer company, and plans to expand these links.
The company earns about half its revenue overseas and plans further expansion. 

A majority stake in Paxus currently held by NZI Corp. will be diluted to slightly less than 50% after IBM acquires its interest. 

The agreement requires approval from Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board and National Companies and Securities Commission, and from shareholders of Paxus.
