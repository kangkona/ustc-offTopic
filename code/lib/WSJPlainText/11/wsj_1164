(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

MORGAN STANLEY, THE ONCE STODGY investment house, in 1974 helped a corporate client complete a hostile takeover.
It was the start of a boom in unfriendly, even ungentlemanly, mergers. 

On July 18, 1974, International Nickle of Canada -- advised by Morgan -- offered $28 a share, equal to $157 million, for ESB, a Philadelphia battery maker.
ESB said it was given only a three-hour advance warning on a "take it or leave it" basis from Inco, as the Toronto company is called. 

"ESB is aware that a hostile tender offer is being made by a foreign company for all of ESB's shares," said F.J. Port, ESB's president. "Hostile" thus entered the merger-acquisition lexicon.
Joseph Flom, of Skadden, Arps, Slote, Meagher & Flom, which became a leading legal firm in merger cases, said the case "made takeovers respectable." 

ESB spurned Inco and within five days ESB had a "white knight" as United Aircraft -- headed by Harry Gray, a shrewdly friendly acquirer of companies -- offered $34 a share.
Gray was advised by Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch.
ESB directors warmly accepted, but a whirlwind bidding match ensued.
Within a few days in July, Inco raised its bid to $36 and United matched it.
On a single day Inco lifted its offer to $38 and then to $41, equal to $225.5 million.
United met the $38 but then withdrew. 

ESB on July 29 accepted the Inco offer and the brief battle -- unlike the intricate and lengthy big takeovers of 1984-1989 -- was over.
The new gritty game became a money maker for Wall Street's once austere old-name houses.
Inco paid Morgan an advisory fee of about $250,000, a paltry figure by today's measures.
Early this year Morgan and three other investment houses each received $25 million in advisory fees from Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts in its $25 billion friendly buy-out of RJR Nabisco.
