Honeywell Inc., Minneapolis, said it completed its previously announced sale of 16% of the shares outstanding in its Japanese joint venture, Yamatake-Honeywell, for $280 million. 

The stake was acquired by a group of 10 Japanese financial institutions and industrial corporations, primarily insurance companies, Honeywell said. 

Proceeds will be used to repurchase as many as 10 million shares of Honeywell stock, as previously announced. 

Honeywell said a second sale of Yamatake-Honeywell is still being negotiated.
The company, which now holds a 34% stake in the venture, has indicated that it intends to retain at least a 20% stake long term.
A 20% stake would allow Honeywell to include Yamatake earnings in its results. 

A company spokesman said the gain on the sale couldn't be estimated until the "tax treatment has been determined."
