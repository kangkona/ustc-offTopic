Boeing Co. said Trans European Airways ordered a dozen 737 jetliners valued at a total of about $450 million.
The 300 and 400 series aircraft will be powered by engines jointly produced by General Electric Co. and Snecma of France. 

Currently, Boeing has a backlog of about $80 billion, but production has been slowed by a strike of 55,000 machinists, which entered its 22nd day today. 

Last week, a mediator failed to rekindle talks between the company and the strikers, who have rejected a pay raise offer of 10% over three years.
