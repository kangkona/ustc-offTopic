Safeway Stores Inc. reported a 69% decline in profit for the fiscal third quarter, but said operating improvements were masked by unusual gains in the year-earlier period. 

The Oakland grocery retailer, closely held since a $4.2 billion leveraged buy-out in 1986, said profit for the three months ended Sept. 9 was $7.1 million, compared with $23 million a year earlier.
But it said the year-earlier results included gains of $23.5 million from divestitures. 

Sales rose 4.2% to $3.31 billion from $3.2 billion. 

For the nine months, the company said profit fell 49% to $23.5 million from $46 million in the year-earlier quarter, which included divestiture-related gains of $50.6 million.
Sales increased 5.5% to $9.81 billion from $9.3 billion.
