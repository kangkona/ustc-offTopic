Trading in Cineplex Odeon Corp. shares was halted on the New York and Toronto stock exchanges late yesterday afternoon at the company's request, Toronto Stock Exchange officials said. 

Brian Hemming, a spokesman for the company's committee of independent directors, established in May to solicit and evaluate offers for the company, said it was expected to make an announcement early this morning.
But Mr. Hemming said he wasn't aware of the nature of the talks under way between committee members and their advisers. 

Cineplex traded on the New York Stock Exchange at $11.25 a share, up $1.125, before trading was halted. 

Analysts have speculated in recent days that the value of offers received by the committee fell well short of what they had hoped, or even that the company's chairman, president and chief executive officer, Garth Drabinsky, is the only bidder for the company as a whole.
The current effort to auction off the company was triggered by a dispute between Mr. Drabinsky and the Toronto-based movie chain's major shareholder, MCA Inc.
