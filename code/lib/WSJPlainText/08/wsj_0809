Michael Grobstein, 46 years old, was named vice chairman for planning, marketing and industry services, a new post.
Mr. Grobstein had been a vice chairman of Ernst & Whinney, an accounting firm that merged with rival Arthur Young in July to form Ernst & Young, a major accounting, tax and management consulting firm.
Mr. Grobstein's appointment formalizes a role he has been performing since the merger, a spokeswoman said.
