Costa Rica is nearing an agreement with its creditors on a plan for restructuring $1.8 billion of its commercial debt, a Bank of America executive said. 

Costa Rica is one of several debtor countries trying to buy back some of their loans under a U.S. initiative named after Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. 

Negotiations have been rushed in order to be completed in time for President Bush's trip to Costa Rica, and the agreement is likely to be announced today.
People involved in the negotiations said the accord will reduce Costa Rica's foreign debt principal by more than 60%. 

"We are reasonably close to an agreement on a Brady-type plan for Costa Rica," said Peter McPherson, Bank of America's executive vice president.
His comments were the first signs of an imminent breakthrough in negotiations between Costa Rica and its commercial lenders. 

Bank of America, which chairs a committee representing Costa Rica's creditors, said the prospective plan would enable the country to buy back about $1 billion of debt at a "substantial discount." The repurchase is to be financed by fresh credits from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and donor governments. 

Costa Rica also would be able to pay overdue interest on its still-outstanding loans at "more favorable terms" than regular debtors, other U.S. bankers said.
