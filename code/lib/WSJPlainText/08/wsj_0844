A.H. Belo Corp. said it asked the Federal Communications Commission to dismiss a request by the Dallas Times Herald calling for the FCC to revoke Belo's Dallas television license. 

In a response to the commission, Belo, owner of the Dallas Morning News, WFAA-TV in Dallas and other TV stations, said that the Times Herald's complaint is "without merit" and is an effort to gain leverage in a legal battle. 

The Dallas Times Herald filed the request with the FCC earlier this month, charging that an agreement between Belo and Universal Press Syndicate is intended to eliminate newspaper competition in Dallas.
The Belo-Universal agreement calls for the two companies to study developing television programs based on Universal's features.
As part of the agreement, Universal moved 26 features, including "Doonesbury," "The Far Side" and Dear Abby, to the Morning News from the Times Herald. 

A lawsuit filed by the Times Herald against Belo charging antitrust law violations and interference with a contract is pending in Houston state court.
