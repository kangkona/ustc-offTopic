An American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unit, AT&T Nassau Metals Corp., said it was soliciting bids for its Gaston, S.C., and Chandler, Ariz., metal-processing operations, which produce annual revenue of about $400 million. 

The unit didn't disclose any asking price, and an AT&T spokesman in Parsippany, N.J., said he couldn't supply one.
An industry analyst, Robert B. Morris III in Goldman, Sachs & Co. 's San Francisco office, said the value of the operations isn't clear because AT&T hasn't disclosed their book value or earnings. 

AT&T Nassau said the operations on the block are no longer "strategic to the core business" of the company, which is telecommunications.
The Gaston operation processes metal scrap and supplies copper rod, largely to AT&T itself.
Also on the block is a small metal chopping operation in Chandler. 

Increasingly, copper-based technology has been superseded by light-wave technology, Mr. Morris said.
