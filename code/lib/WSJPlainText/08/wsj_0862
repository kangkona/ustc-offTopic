London share prices closed sharply lower Thursday after the market's confidence in U.K. corporate profits was shaken severely by bellwether Imperial Chemical Industries PLC's disappointing earnings in the third quarter. 

Stocks rose in Tokyo for the first time since Monday, and ended mixed in Frankfurt. 

In London, ICI, which is part of the Financial Times 100-share index, said its pretax profit for the quarter dropped 12%, significantly worse than market expectations.
Its profit for the first nine months of the year rose only 9%, also short of market expectations. 

As ICI's share price fell, the 100-share index followed.
The index closed at its intraday low of 2129.4, down 32.5 points. 

"ICI is a bellwether of U.K. corporate profitability," a senior dealer with Warburg Securities said. "Its results were disappointing.
The market followed." 

The 30-share index fell 31.4 points to close at 1720.5.
Volume was 443.6 million shares traded, better than 374.6 million Wednesday, but still a relatively thin session. 

ICI finished 73 pence a share lower at #10.97 ($17.70) on turnover of 3.4 million shares. 

Analysts had anticipated soft earnings in petrochemicals and plastics, but said they were surprised by trading losses in ICI's specialty paints and films operations. 

Dealers and analysts also said that ICI's troubles in specialty paints helped underscore growing worries over the U.S. economy.
ICI's paint operations are heavily involved in the U.S. 

Those concerns were fortified by Wall Street's continued slide, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 35.25 points at 2618.03 when London closed. 

In other shares, U.K. textile group Tootal rose 7 to 120 pence on conditional clearance from regulators for Coats Viyella's bid for Tootal, so long as Coats spins off its U.K. sewing thread business.
Coats slid 5 to 142. 

Tokyo stocks rebounded sharply from two consecutive daily losses, helped by index-related buying by investment funds in the afternoon session. 

The Nikkei index closed up 236.09 points at 35678.49.
The Tokyo stock price index of first section issues was up 25.01 at 2697.58.
First section volume was estimated at 850 million shares, down from 1.1 billion Wednesday. 

In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index rose 36.36 points to 35714.85. 

On Thursday, the market opened in a bullish mood with participation from institutional investors, who had refrained from active trading in the past couple of months. 

Market observers attributed improved sentiment to the recent stability of the dollar, which offset expectations that the U.S. currency might surge above the 145-150 yen level. 

The Nikkei continued to gain during the afternoon session, briefly reaching above its recent record level. 

Trading focused on large-capitalization issues that are related to domestic demand and made a sharp contrast to export-related shares.
Export shares were spurned because of continuing uncertainty on Wall Street, said Shin Tokoi, deputy general manager of Japanese equities at County Natwest Securities, Japan. 

Outstanding winners Thursday were non-life insurance and securities companies. 

Yasuda Fire & Marine advanced 90 yen to 1,680 yen ($11.90).
Taisho Marine & Fire was up 80 at 1,620, and Tokio Marine & Fire advanced 40 to 2,230. 

Securities companies also made across-the-board gains as recent increases in stock trading volume are expected to boost their commission income, traders said. 

Yamaichi Securities gained 120 to 1,940, Nomura Securities surged 260 to 3,450, and Nikko Securities gained 110 to 1,940. 

Steel shares also ended higher.
Sumitomo Metal was up 22 to 703, and Nippon Steel advanced 24 to 735. 

Frankfurt prices ended mixed in thin trading after an early rally led by Deutsche Bank fizzled during the session.
The DAX index, which reached a peak around 1500 early in the day, closed at 1482.62, up only 1.54 points from Wednesday. 

Deutsche Bank surged at the opening on news that the bank has 10% holdings in several large companies, including insurer Allianz and reinsurer Munich Re.
Because the shares are kept at the historically lowest value on the books, they constitute huge hidden reserves, traders said. 

The disclosure late Wednesday came as Deutsche Bank announced the issue of 1.2 million new shares for placement in the Tokyo market. 

Deutsche Bank jumped 28.5 marks early in the session, pulling the broader market along, traders said. 

But profit-taking soon wiped out these gains, traders said.
While Deutsche Bank was still 12 marks higher at 657 ($358) at the close, most other blue-chip shares had small losses. 

Traders said the late decline points to a deep sense of unease in the market. 

Many investment funds have already closed their books for the year, a dealer said. "People have made excellent profits in the first 10 months, and they don't want to risk that any more.
The mood is very cautious, so I don't think we will go firmer any time soon." 

But other traders said there are good buying opportunities at the lower levels because the market should soon pull out of its slump.
They pointed to last year's example, when the stock market staged a major rally just before the Christmas holidays. 

Among other banks, Dresdner Bank gained 1.5 to 321.5 after receiving official authorization to acquire Banque Internationale de Placement in France, but Commerzbank slipped 0.5 to 246. 

Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Zurich, lower in Paris, Brussels, Milan and Amsterdam, and mixed in Stockholm. 

Stocks closed higher in Sydney, Taipei, Wellington and Seoul, lower in Hong Kong and Singapore and mixed in Manila.
