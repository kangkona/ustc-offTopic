Brunswick Corp. posted a third-quarter loss of $103.1 million, or $1.17 a share, reflecting a $100 million pretax charge due to the restructuring of its marine products group. 

In the year-earlier third quarter, the Skokie, Ill.-based company earned $43.2 million, or 50 cents a share.
Sales fell 18% to $627.7 million from $767.9 million. 

Brunswick said a 28% decline in its marine sales during the quarter reflected the continued industrywide decline in domestic retail sales of marine products.
Brunswick also has interests in defense and aerospace products. 

The company said the charge, which amounts to $79.2 million after taxes, reflects the write-off of certain assets and the estimated costs associated with the reorganization.
In July, the company said it would begin scaling back manufacturing operations in its marine group and reduce the group's work force by 20%, or about 4,000 employees. 

For the nine months, Brunswick had a loss of $65.4 million, or 74 cents a share, compared with net income of $176.1 million, or $2 a share.
Sales fell to $2.19 billion from $2.53 billion. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Brunswick closed at $14.50, down 37.5 cents.
