President Bush unveiled food-safety proposals that would significantly increase the penalties for the misuse of pesticides. 

Under the plan, released at a White House briefing yesterday, the civil penalty for the illegal sale, distribution or commercial use of a pesticide would be raised to a maximum $25,000 a day for each violation.
Currently, the maximum civil fine is $5,000 a violation.
Criminal violations would be raised to felonies from misdemeanors. 

At the same time, reporting requirements would be increased for farmers and others who use pesticides that have restricted uses.
The Environmental Protection Agency also would get greater inspection authority. 

The package also contains proposals that would speed the removal of harmful pesticides from the market and would provide for the establishment of consistent "negligible risk" levels for pesticides in fresh and processed food.
Chemicals that posed risks greater than these levels generally would be barred, unless the EPA determined that other factors, such as the economic effect on consumers, outweighed the risk. 

The proposals also are designed to bar states in most cases from setting more-stringent pesticide tolerance levels than the federal government sets.
Information released yesterday, however, indicates that states could seek waivers and set their own levels if special circumstances exist.
