Bond investors sat on the sidelines yesterday, paying little attention to falling stock prices and the government's latest gross national product report. 

"This was a bit surprising," said John Lonski, an economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc.
He said that in recent weeks, such news has often set a positive tone for the bond market. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 39.55 points to close at 2613.73.
Meanwhile, the government reported that third-quarter real gross national product, the inflation-adjusted value of the nation's goods and services, rose at an annual rate of 2.5% in the third quarter. 

Although the rate of growth was unchanged from the second quarter, economists said the new GNP report had an ominous tone.
Among other things, the report showed a sharp deterioration in export trade, which had been a major source of strength for the economy. 

Bond investors didn't show much reaction to the news.
As a result, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which meandered for most of the day, ended little changed.
Mortgage-backed securities moved slightly higher, and investment-grade corporate bonds ended unchanged. 

In the junk bond market, most prices were unchanged to slightly lower.
But there was one notable exception.
The junk bonds of RJR Nabisco, which have been whipsawed in recent months for a variety of reasons, fell sharply yesterday on rumors of possible problems with RJR's pending $1.48 billion sale of its Del Monte canned foods unit to a group led by Merrill Lynch & Co. However, late yesterday, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch said the planned sale is on track. 

Proceeds from the Del Monte sale would account for a portion of the $5 billion worth of bank debt RJR had planned to repay by Feb. 9.
RJR bonds closed one to two points lower, or off between $10 to $20 for each $1,000 face amount.
RJR's 13 1/2% subordinated debentures maturing in 2001 were off 1/2 at 101, while its 14.7% convertible pay-in-kind securities finished the day down 1 7/8 at 86. 

In the municipal market, institutional selling drove prices sharply lower.
The municipal market has been struggling for weeks to absorb large customer "bid-wanted" lists, or sell orders.
But dealers said inventories now are full and bids for bonds are getting soft. 

Among others, a bid-wanted list totaling about $109 million circulated yesterday.
It followed a $223 million sell list handled by Chemical Securities Inc. Wednesday and at least three other lists in that size range within the past two weeks. 

Traders said the bonds appear to be coming from a range of investors, with commercial banks among the leading sellers.
Tax law changes that go into effect later this year make municipal holdings less attractive to certain investors. 

Municipal market participants also remain concerned that property and casualty insurers may be forced to lighten their tax-exempt holdings as a result of claims stemming from Hurricane Hugo and the Northern California earthquake. 

Treasury, Agency Securities 

The Treasury market could get an unexpected $17 billion of new supply next week. 

Late yesterday, a Treasury official said the department may take the unprecedented step of borrowing $17 billion to avoid default on certain obligations unless Congress assures by 1 p.m. EDT today that it will raise the debt limit, according to Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. 

If assurance isn't given, the official said the Treasury might raise the money by adding to the weekly Treasury bill issue or through a cash-management bill issue. 

The official said Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady indicated the possible move in a letter dated yesterday to House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R., Ill.). 

Separately, the $4.52 billion of Resolution Funding Corp. bonds sold Wednesday were quoted late yesterday at 99 19/32, down 1/8 from the auction average. 

Much of the Refcorp issue was purchased by four large securities firms that had planned to repackage the bonds.
But yesterday, some dealers said the repackaged bonds were selling slowly. 

The benchmark 30-year bond ended at about 102 21/32, compared with 102 22/32 Wednesday.
The yield was unchanged at 7.88%.
The 10-year notes ended at about 100 23/32, compared with 100 24/32.
The yield was unchanged at 7.87%. 

Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities 

Mortgage securities were 1/32 to 4/32 point higher, with Government National Mortgage Association 10 1/2% securities the top-performing issue. 

Dealers said the 10 1/2% securities rose in response to a $500 million purchase by a bank for its mortgage portfolio.
The dealers noted that the securities, which gained 4/32 to 104 1/32, have been relatively weak recently because high-coupon securities aren't favored in rising markets.
Thus, the issue has quite a high yield. 

Ginnie Mae 9% securities were at 98 5/8 late yesterday, up 2/32, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9% securities were at 97 3/4, up 1/32.
The yield spread of the Ginnie Mae 9% issue over the 10-year Treasury note narrowed 0.01 percentage point to 1.45. 

In derivative markets, the Federal National Mortgage Association issued a $500 million real estate mortgage investment conduit backed by its 9% securities through Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 

In other matters, Maryland National Bank, a unit of Baltimore-based MNC Financial Inc., became the first commercial bank to issue securities backed by home-equity lines of credit.
The $267 million transaction was underwritten by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. 

Foreign Bonds 

British government bonds rose for the fourth consecutive day, buoyed by a firm pound and further weakness in British stocks.
But later, after trading had basically ended, the pound declined sharply on the unexpected resignation of Nigel Lawson, Chancellor of the Exchequer. 

The Treasury 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 rose 10/32 to 112 30/32 to yield 9.95%, while the 12% notes due 1995 were up 3/32 at 104 11/32 to yield 10.86%. 

Japanese government bonds ended lower after quiet trading, pulled down in part by the sale of 500 billion yen ($3.53 billion) of new one-year bonds.
They were priced at 99.58 to yield 5.163% with a coupon rate of 5.1%. 

The rate compares with a 4.9% coupon at the previous auction in August.
In response to the auction, Japan's No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers' screens at 95.33, down 0.20, to yield 5.39%. 

West German bonds ended lower in quiet trading.
Bonn's 7% bonds due October 1999 fell 0.10 to 99.95 to yield 7.01%. 

Municipals 

Details of New York City's forthcoming bond offering were released yesterday.
As described in the preliminary official statement, the city will offer $729 million of tax-exempt bonds tentatively structured as serial bonds maturing in 1989 to 2008. 

The city also plans to sell $57.8 million of taxable municipal bonds at the same time, possibly maturing in 1994, 2004, 2009 and 2010.
The bulk of the taxable bonds are in the two longest maturities, which are tentatively to total $26.9 million each. 

In the secondary market, New York City 7% bonds due 2014 were offered priced to yield 7.70%, while 7 1/2% bonds due 2007 were offered at 98 to yield 7.71%. 

Among active issues, New Jersey Turnpike Authority 7.20% bonds due 2018 were off 1/4 point at 98 1/4 bid to yield 7.35%. 

Corporate Issues 

Most corporate bonds were unchanged to slightly lower. 

New-issue volume dropped off sharply from Wednesday. 

Among the issuers that tapped the debt market yesterday was Tenneco Credit Corp.
The subsidiary of Tenneco Inc. offered $150 million of seven-year senior notes priced to yield 9.324%.
The issue was sold through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
