Imperial Chemical Industries PLC , a major British chemicals and pharmaceuticals concern, said pretax profit in the first nine months of the year rose 9% on growth in pharmaceutical sales. 

Pretax profit rose to #1.23 billion ($1.99 billion) from #1.13 billion in the year-earlier period.
The company's pretax profit, however, was hit particularly hard by soft returns in ICI's petrochemical and plastics operations during the third quarter. 

Third-quarter pretax profit dropped 12% to #306 million from #347 million in the 1988 period, ICI said.
The results for the third quarter and nine months were worse than expected. 

ICI said its nine-month profit after tax, or net profit attributable to shareholders, rose 18% to #744 million from #632 million in the year-earlier period.
Per-share earnings increased 9% to 108.3 pence ($1.75) from 99.7 pence.
