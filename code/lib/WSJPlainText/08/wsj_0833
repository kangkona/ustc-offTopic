Delta Air Lines, in a move that could help it thwart the kind of takeover attempts that have bedeviled other airlines this year, agreed to sell about 5% of its stock to Singapore Airlines Ltd. 

It was the second such transaction for the Atlanta-based airline, which this summer sold a 5% stake to Swissair and placed another 14% of its stock in employees' hands. 

As part of a 10-year marketing agreement with Singapore Airlines announced yesterday, Delta also agreed to spend about $183 million -- the same amount Singapore Airlines will spend for its Delta shares -- to buy a similar stake in Singapore Airlines. 

Delta wouldn't comment on whether the moves were anti-takeover measures.
But they come after a period during which three of the carrier's largest rivals were the subject of takeover bids. 

With its fat profits, low debt levels and steady growth, Delta has been considered by Wall Street analysts as likely prey for corporate raiders.
Its shares have risen nearly 15% over the past six months.
Yesterday, it closed at $66.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, down 12.5 cents. 

Under the terms of equity cross-purchase agreements, Singapore Airlines agreed to buy 2.5 million shares of Delta common stock for 110% of its closing price for the four days surrounding its purchase announcement.
Delta agreed to buy the same dollar amount of Singapore Airlines shares. 

Singapore Airlines also agreed not to transfer its Delta shares and to vote those shares in the same proportion as all other shares are voted or as recommended by Delta's board.
Delta made a similar pact regarding its Singapore Airlines holdings. 

As part of the 10-year marketing agreement, the two airlines also plan to coordinate their schedules and possibly operate joint service on certain routes. 

An added benefit for Delta is that its agreement with Singapore Airlines provides a toehold in the Pacific, where U.S. airlines face the best possibility of expansion.
