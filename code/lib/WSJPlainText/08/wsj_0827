Accor S.A. of France withdrew from an agreement to acquire a 51% stake in Greetings Group Ltd., an Australian hotel operator. 

A spokesman for Credit Lyonnais May Mellor Ltd., Accor's Australian financial adviser, said in a telephone interview that Accor "decided that the deal as originally structured wasn't suitable." 

But negotiations are continuing and a new agreement might be reached next month, the spokesman added. 

"Accor would still like to have a presence in Australia, and alternative arrangements are being considered," the spokesman said.
He wouldn't discuss any details of the new proposals. 

In September, Accor entered into an option agreement with major shareholders of Greetings that would have given Accor a 51% stake through an issue of new shares.
