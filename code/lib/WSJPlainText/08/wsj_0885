Two New England banks reported substantial third-quarter net losses, reflecting the continuing woes of the region's developers and lenders. 

One Bancorp, Portland, Maine, buffeted by loan write-downs and expanded loss reserves, reported a net loss of $48.5 million, or $5.92 a share.
In the year-earlier period, the bank holding company reported net income of $523,000, or six cents a share. 

Holyoke, Mass.-based Heritage Bancorp, also hurt by the depressed New England real estate market, reported a net loss of $8.9 million, or $1.22 a share, compared with net income of $3 million, or 40 cents a share. 

One Bancorp, which had warned that it planned to take a $49.8 million loan-loss provision in the third quarter, said it expects things to get worse, but more slowly, in the future. "Barring marked and unanticipated declines in real estate values, we expect our growth rates of nonperforming loans to slow," Vincent E. Furey Jr., president and chief executive officer, said. 

After taking write-downs of about $75 million in the last 12 months, he said the company is in position, "to address accelerated disposal of problem assets." 

One Bancorp's primary capital-to-asset ratio is 6.6% after third-quarter charges.
Under federal regulations, a 6% ratio is the standard.
However, the company said it isn't in compliance with certain standards it agreed to last fall in connection with two Massachusetts acquisitions. 

Mr. Furey said the company is working to restore its capital ratio to regulatory compliance and expects to reach an agreement with regulators during the fourth quarter.
He said he expects a formal written agreement documenting One Bancorp's plan to reduce problem assets and return to compliance. 

The third-quarter loss reflected a $49.8 million provision for loan losses and write-downs of $8.5 million on foreclosed real estate.
One Bancorp said its loan-loss reserve of $59.4 million at Sept. 30 was 2.9% of loans outstanding and 35% of $170 million in nonperforming loans.
At June 30, reserves of $52.2 million were 2.4% of loans outstanding and 35% of $150 million in nonperforming loans. 

Loan and real-estate write-downs have reduced $195 million in nonperforming assets by 28% from their original loan value, One Bancorp said.
Nonperforming assets consist of $170 million in nonperforming loans and $25 million in real estate acquired by agreement or foreclosure. 

As a result of the losses, stockholders' equity declined to $76.6 million, or $9.35 a share, at Sept. 30, from $125.1 million, or $15.27 a share, at June 30. 

For the first nine months of 1989, net losses at One Bancorp totaled $74.5 million, or $9.12 a share, compared to net income of $9.7 million, or $1.13 a share, in the year-earlier period. 

Heritage Bancorp said it added $17 million to its loan-loss reserve, making the reserve $24.7 million or 1.6% of total loans and 35% of nonperforming loans.
Nonperforming loans increased from $32.2 million as of June 30, 1988, to $69.6 million as of Sept. 30, 1989. 

Assets at Sept. 30 totaled $1.73 billion. 

Chairman Richard B. Covell said he expects that Heritage will rebound in the fourth quarter and return to a positive mode of operation in 1990. "We are aggressively pursuing workout strategies with respect to nonperforming assets in an effort to resolve these problems as expeditiously as possible, while simultaneously minimizing losses to the company," he said. 

For the nine months, Heritage reported a net loss of $10.9 million, or $1.49 a share, compared to net income of $8.3 million, or $1.12 a share.
