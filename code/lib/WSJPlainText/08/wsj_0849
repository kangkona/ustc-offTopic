Enimont S.p.
A. said net income totaled 525 billion lire ($390 million) for the first half of 1989. 

The Italian chemicals company didn't provide year-earlier figures because it was formed on Jan. 1 as a joint venture between Montedison S.p.
A. and state-owned Enichem S.p.
A. 

A joint statement issued by the two partners said Enimont rang up revenue of 8.2 trillion lire ($6.09 billion), while gross operating profit amounted to 1.4 trillion lire in the opening half of the year. 

The statement didn't address the issue of a possible change at the top management as Chairman Lorenzo Necci is expected to be appointed chairman of Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, succeeding Franco Reviglio whose term expires in November.
ENI, the state energy concern, is Enichem's parent. 

According to local news reports, Gabriele Cagliari, a member of ENI's executive council, is a front runner to take over Mr. Necci's post at Enimont.
