Investors ran away from the stock market yesterday, dumping many recently favored stocks as they fled. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 39.55 to 2613.73.
New York Stock Exchange volume rose to 175,240,000 shares from 155.6 million Wednesday. 

Badly shaken by recent big swings in stock prices and the cloudy outlook for the economy, investors sold many of the consumer-oriented blue chips that were the market's star performers only a week ago.
Many of those issues-such as Philip Morris, Procter & Gamble and Merck -- are in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 

Traders said investors were either raising cash or buying very selectively.
In a sign of just how nervous investors are, precious-metals stocks were among the best performers yesterday. 

Compaq Computer's disappointing earnings report after the market closed Wednesday set the pace for the sell-off yesterday.
Compaq closed down 8 5/8 to 100 on 2.6 million shares.
Compaq, a highly sought stock only a few days ago, hit a record high of 112 1/2 on Oct. 19. 

Third-quarter earnings were on the low end of analysts' forecasts, and the company disclosed that it had uncovered two technical flaws in Intel's new microprocessor, which could cause delays in shipments of some new Compaq products.
Intel dropped 7/8 to 32 in over-the-counter trading. 

"When you see what happened to Compaq, it is completely (numbing) for the mentality of the market," said Jack Solomon, technical analyst for Bear Stearns. "It is hard for the mind to digest that what was the leading stock is now the one leading you down the tubes." 

Investors took little comfort in yesterday's report that third-quarter gross national product grew at a 2.5% annual rate.
Though that growth was in line with expectations, investors focused on signs of a slowdown: a buildup in inventories and dubious strength in consumer spending. 

Futures-related selling pushed the industrial average about 45 points lower in the morning as rumors about RJR Nabisco's pending sale of its Del Monte foods unit spread through the trading pits in Chicago.
The purchase of Del Monte is likely to be financed with junk bonds or a bridge loan.
The stock market has had a heightened concern about turmoil with high-risk financing ever since Campeau Corp. nearly missed an interest payment on its junk bonds in September. 

While futures-related sell programs depressed prices at first, buy programs pared the industrial average's losses later in the session.
However, Donald Selkin, head of futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities, said that the stock market appears to be poised for a round of futures-related selling this morning, given the discrepancies between futures and stocks at the close. 

The New York Stock Exchange started trading its new "basket" product yesterday, with which institutions can buy and sell all the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in one trade.
About $45 million of stock traded through the basket. 

In a sign of the credit needs among market makers during the 190-point plunge on Oct. 13, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said yesterday that loans by New York's nine largest banks for the financing of securities positions rose $786 million, to $6.6 billion during the week ending Oct. 18. 

Among other computer stocks, International Business Machines fell 1 1/8 to 100 3/4 on 1.7 million shares, Digital Equipment droped 2 1/4 to 88 and Unisys lost 1/2 to 17.
Also, Tandem Computers lost 1 to 24 7/8 even though earnings for the September quarter were in line with expectations. 

Semiconductor issues slumped as well; Texas Instruments dropped 1 to 31 1/2, Motorola fell 5/8 to 55 1/4 and Cypress Semiconductor lost 1/2 to 12 1/4. 

Anheuser-Busch slid 1/2 to 38 and led the Big Board's list of most active issues as 4.3 million shares were traded.
The stock had plunged 4 3/8 Wednesday on the news of third-quarter earnings weakness and its discounting strategy, which it expects to affect results through the end of 1990. 

Philip Morris fell 1 7/8 to 41 5/8 on 3.7 million shares, reflecting the possibility that Anheuser-Busch's decision could have a negative impact on results at its Miller Brewing unit. 

Other consumer stocks coming under selling pressure included Procter & Gamble, which went down 3 1/4 to 126 3/4; Coca-Cola Co., down 1 3/8 to 71 1/8, McDonald's, down 1/4 to 31 1/4; PepsiCo, off 1 to 60 3/8, and Merck, down 1 1/2 to 76 3/4. 

Auto stocks slumped as each of the nation's Big Three auto makers reported that third-quarter operating profits were down from 1988.
Ford Motor, which also said it expects results for the fourth quarter to be soft because of a slowdown in auto sales, dropped 3/8 to 47 1/2.
General Motors lost 1/2 to 44 3/8 and Chrysler slid 3/8 to 22 1/4. 

Oil field-services issues were especially weak.
Shearson Lehman Hutton cut short-term investment ratings on Schlumberger, which went down 2 1/4 to 41 1/8; Halliburton, down 1 1/8 to 35 1/8; Dresser Industries, off 1 to 37 3/4, and Baker Hughes, down 3/4 to 21.
Precious-metals stocks, widely viewed as a safe investment haven in periods of uncertainty, posted solid gains.
Newmont Gold climbed 2 1/2 to 39, Battle Mountain Gold rose 1 to 16, Hecla Mining went up 5/8 to 13 3/8, Homestake Mining added 5/8 to 15 3/4 and ASA Ltd. rose 2 to 46. 

Tandy fell 5/8 to 43 3/8 on 1.8 million shares, including a 1.5 million-share block that the company repurchased as part of an ongoing buy-back program.
The block equaled 1.7% of its shares outstanding. 

Nipsco Industries, the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service, rose 1/2 to 17 7/8.
Its board authorized the repurchase of an additional 3.5 million common shares, or about 5% of its shares outstanding, under an ongoing buy-back program. 

N.V. Philips, whose third-quarter net profit was up 41% from a year earlier, added 1/2 to 22 1/4.
Also, the company said it would file for an initial offering of a 20% stake in its Polygram unit, as expected. 

Imperial Chemical Industries plunged 6 1/4 to 69 7/8.
The company's third-quarter pretax profit was 12% lower than the year-ago level and fell short of its expectations. 

Quantum Chemical, which reported a loss for the third quarter, dropped 1 1/2 to 33 1/4.
The company also suspended payment of cash dividends on its common stock until at least next April; it plans to pay stock dividends instead. 

Telerate, which said it is holding talks with Dow Jones about the latter's $18-a-share takeover offer, advanced 7/8 to 20 1/2.
Earlier this month, a special committee of Telerate's board rejected the bid as inadequate. 

The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 2.44 to 373.48.
Volume totaled 12,190,000 shares. 

La Jolla Bancorp climbed 3 to 13.
Security Pacific signed a letter of intent to acquire the company in a stock swap valued at $15 a share.
