UAL Corp. 's third-quarter net income fell 72%, but that reflected a large year-earlier special gain and sizable expense this year for stock appreciation rights tied to recent takeover activity. 

UAL, parent of United Airlines, said net income fell to $110.9 million, or $5.11 a share, from $402.4 million, or $18.68 a share.
The year-earlier quarter included a one-time after-tax gain of $223.4 million from the sale of interests in its computerized reservations partnership, Covia. 

The company said its third-quarter results reflected the recent sharp climb in UAL stock to $282 a share as of Sept. 29, sparked by bids from Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis and a labor-management buy-out group.
UAL's board approved the labor-management bid Sept. 14.
But the bid collapsed two weeks ago, and the stock has dropped sharply since.
Thus, UAL said it expects to reverse most of the stock appreciation expenses in the fourth quarter. 

The stock appreciation rights are related to stock options that UAL officers hold.
As the value of UAL stock rises, the company must reflect this in its accounting methods as an increased expense. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, UAL shares rose $9.75 to $170.75 on volume of 1.1 million shares. 

Excluding the stock appreciation expense this year and the special gain last year, per-share earnings would have been $6.74 in the third quarter, compared with $8.31.
Most industry analysts expected UAL to report third-quarter earnings of around $7 a share. 

Third-quarter revenue rose 7% to $2.58 billion from $2.41 billion.
Third-quarter traffic was up 3% to 19.3 billion revenue passenger miles from 18.8 billion in the year earlier.
A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flown one mile. 

For the nine months, net income fell 71% to $317.3 million, or $14.66 a share, from $1.1 billion, or $34.35 a share, which includes the gain from the sale of Covia interests.
Revenue increased 10% to $7.43 billion from $6.76 billion.
Traffic was nearly flat at 52.8 billion revenue passenger miles vs. 52.6 billion miles a year earlier. 

Separately, the leadership of UAL's machinists union met to discuss the possibility of proposing a recapitalization to UAL's board.
The leadership came to no conclusion, and discussions will continue.
The board said Monday it believes the company should remain independent for now.
Takeover stock traders and other investors, however, have been pushing for some form of recapitalization to regain the losses they suffered when the labor-management bid collapsed.
