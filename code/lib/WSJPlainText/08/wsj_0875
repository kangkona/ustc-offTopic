Assets of the nation's 476 money market funds rose $1.26 billion to $357.49 billion in the week ended Wednesday. 

The Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade group, said assets of 236 general-purpose funds rose $300.1 million to $116.91 billion; assets of 96 broker-dealer funds rose $1.72 billion to $155.76 billion; and assets of 144 institutional funds fell $751.4 million to $84.82 billion. 

"The movements in assets differed markedly across fund categories," said Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist for the institute. 

Money market funds were offering lower yields, but individuals nonetheless "kept adding money to their account balances," Mr. Dreyer said. 

Most of the money flowed into funds in the broker-dealer category, he said, suggesting that investors liquidated some equity holdings because of recent turbulence in the stock market. 

"By contrast, assets of institutional funds actually declined as money managers, anticipating further easing of yields, moved into direct money-market instruments of slightly longer maturities and intermediate-term bonds," Mr. Dreyer said.
