Just when it looked like the Nasdaq over-the-counter market might be firming, nervous investors dumped shares of the biggest nonfinancial issues and sent the market tumbling. 

Because of the heavy selling of such large stocks as Intel, Oracle Systems, Apple Computer, Microsoft and Lotus Development, the Nasdaq Composite Index slumped 4.74, or 1%, to 458.15.
Those stocks and other industrial issues are part of the Nasdaq 100 Index, which plunged 8.12, or 1.8%, to 

By comparison, the New York Stock Exchange Composite fell 1%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1.5% and the S&P 500 Index dropped 1%. 

Every Nasdaq industry index was lower.
The Utility Index, which includes Tele-Communications, MCI Communications and LIN Broadcasting, plummeted 9.55 to 734.41.
All three of those stocks declined.
Industrial stocks fell 5.80 to 444.19 and transportation issues slid 4.03 to 478.28. 

The Other Finance Index -- the barometer of regional banking, real-estate-investment and brokerage issues, dropped 2.58 to 536.94.
The index of small commercial banks was down 2.54 to 440.99 and the index of insurance stocks eased 0.84 to 536.04.
The Nasdaq Financial Index of the 100 largest stocks in the group lost 2.11 to 452.75. 

"The market felt sloppy.
I didn't see any buying at all," said William Sulya, head OTC trader at A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. 

Mr. Sulya also noted that volume was tepid, totaling only 128.7 million shares. "We were down and it was quiet on top of it.
Those are two nails in a trader's coffin," he commented. 

Some traders complained that OTC market makers are becoming more risk-averse because of the recent volatility.
Tony Cecin, managing director of equity trading at Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis, said the overall OTC market is drifting lower in part because "nobody has the nerve to make a bid for anything," he said.
Mostly in response to news from bellwether Compaq Computer, the OTC market's technology stocks were battered all day.
Compaq's quarterly earnings were at the low end of analysts' forecasts, and the company said it is experiencing problems with a new microchip from Intel.
Intel confirmed the Compaq report, but said the problems aren't expected to affect most users, except in "certain scientific applications." Intel said it has more than 200 customers using the chip. 

Nevertheless, Intel dropped 7/8 to 32 on 3.6 million shares.
Other computer stocks caught in the fallout included Apple, which fell 1 1/4 to 45 1/4.
Oracle Systems dropped 1 to 24 5/8.
Microsoft tumbled 2 to 77 3/4 and Lotus Development was off 1 5/8 to 30 5/8. 

Sun Microsystems eased 5/8 to 17 1/8, despite better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings.
Yesterday, Sun reported net income of seven cents a share, compared with 26 cents a share a year earlier.
But the report was better than the flat earnings the company had projected this summer, after reporting a loss for its fiscal fourth quarter.
Also, Sun's sales in its first quarter, ended Sept. 29, were up 39% from the year-earlier period. 

MCI lost 1/4 to 42 3/4.
In response to a similar lawsuit by MCI filed earlier, American Telephone & Telegraph sued its competitor for misleading advertising. 

Jaguar fell 5/8 to 11.
General Motors said it is seeking clearance to buy as much as 15% of the company.
On Wednesday, Ford Motor said it had already bought 12.45% of the British company's shares and may bid for the rest.
Yesterday, Ford said it won't enter an unlimited bidding war with GM for Jaguar's shares. 

Buffets slid 1 to 14 after reporting third-quarter earnings of 17 cents a share, one cent below the low end of analysts' estimates.
The company earned 14 cents a share in the year-earlier period. 

Chartwell Group plunged 1 1/2 to 1 1/2 after estimating that it had a loss of about $3.2 million in the latest third quarter, before a $5,350,000 addition to loss reserves.
The company also said it wouldn't make the semiannual interest payment on its $40 million of 7% convertible subordinated debentures by the Nov. 1 due date or within the grace period.
It blamed softness in the interior-furnishings industry for its financial troubles. 

Astec Industries tumbled 2 1/8 to 9 7/8 after it reported a $2.4 million loss in the latest third quarter, compared with net income of more than $1 million a year earlier.
The paving-equipment maker said the loss was caused by bad weather, which had hurt sales in its Barber-Greene Co. and Telsmith Inc. units. 

Foremost Corp. of America surged 2 1/8 to 36 1/2.
The company's third-quarter net income rose to eight cents a share from five cents a share the year before.
The mobile-home insurer said Hurricane Hugo cost it 80 cents a share in the latest quarter.
