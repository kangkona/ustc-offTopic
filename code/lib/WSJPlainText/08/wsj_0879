Avon Products Inc. posted a third-quarter profit of $34.6 million, reversing a year-earlier loss. 

The cosmetics, jewelry and gift products concern had per-share earnings of 46 cents in the latest quarter.
A year earlier, it reported a loss of $405.9 million, or $7.78 a share, due to a one-time $425 million charge for discontinued operations. 

Sales rose 8% to $785.1 million from $725.6 million. 

Avon said sales in the direct-selling division dropped 2% as sales of new products, especially gift and jewelry lines, were below expectations.
The weak sales are expected to continue into the fourth quarter, Avon added. 

"Third-quarter net was on target with expectations," said Andrew Shore, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
But the third quarter isn't the problem, Mr. Shore added. "It's the fourth quarter and what might linger beyond that." 

Last month, Avon executives indicated that the company would experience a $75 million to $90 million revenue shortage due to weakness in its gift and decorative lines. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Avon closed at $26.875, down 87.5 cents. 

The company's retail prestige fragrance division, which includes Giorgio Beverly Hills and Parfums Stern, posted 35% higher sales.
Earlier this month, Avon said it agreed to sell its Valentino fragrance business and the inventory of its Parfums Stern unit to Italy's Valentino Group for about $12.3 million in cash and notes. 

In the nine months, Avon earned $80.3 million, or 97 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $461.1 million, or $7.20 a share.
Revenue rose 11% to $2.27 billion from $2.05 billion.
