Maclean Hunter Ltd. said its board approved a shareholder-rights plan that would prevent a suitor from gaining effective control of the company without shareholder approval. 

The plan is similar to modified "poison pills" recently adopted by several other Canadian companies.
But it leaves open the possibility of an acquisition of Maclean Hunter without approval by its board. 

Under the plan, holders other than a suitor would be able to buy additional shares at 50% of the market price, if a person or group acquired 10% of Maclean Hunter's Class X voting shares.
The plan wouldn't be triggered if the board approved the acquisition or if the suitor made an offer for all shares outstanding and the offer was approved by 50% of holders, other than the bidder, at a special meeting. 

Ronald Osborne, president and chief executive officer of the publishing, broadcasting and cable-television concern, said the plan is meant to ensure that all shareholders enjoy any takeover premium in the event of an acquisition.
He said he didn't know of any planned takeover moves against the company. 

Mr. Osborne said Maclean Hunter Holdings Ltd., owned by certain directors and subsidiaries of Maclean Hunter, has a voting interest of about 20% in the company; no other holder has as much as 10%. 

The plan takes effect immediately, pending shareholder confirmation at its annual meeting in April.
The company said holders also will be asked to approve the reclassification of Class X and non-voting Class Y shares into a single class of voting common shares on a one-for-one basis.
It said the market value of Class Y shares had traded at a "significant discount" to Class X shares. 

Separately, Maclean Hunter said third-quarter net income fell 12% to 19.2 million Canadian dollars ($16.4 million), or 12 Canadian cents (10.2 U.S. cents) a share, from C$21.9 million, or 14 Canadian cents a share, a year ago.
Revenue was up 6.8% to C$336.5 million from $315.2 million.
