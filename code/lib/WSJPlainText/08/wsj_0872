Norwegian industrial and energy concern Norsk Hydro A.S. said pretax profit dropped 1.9% to 4.12 billion Norwegian kroner ($599.1 million), or 10.30 kroner a share, in the first nine months from 4.20 billion kroner, or 11 kroner a share, in the corresponding period last year. 

Norsk Hydro said group operating income for the first nine months rose 15.5% to 5.35 billion kroner from 4.63 billion kroner a year earlier. 

The company said operating profit for oil and gas increased substantially, while operating profit for agriculture, light metals and petrochemicals was weaker than in the same period in 1988. 

In the third quarter, per-share earnings were 2.00 kroner, up from 1.60 kroner a year earlier, but lower than the 2.30 kroner to 3.00 kroner expected by analysts.
