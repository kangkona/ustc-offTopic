Braniff Inc. said it has retained Merrill Lynch Capital Markets to advise it on alternatives -- including a possible sale -- as the cash-strapped airline maneuvers through bankruptcy-law court proceedings. 

The carrier, a unit of BIA-COR Holding Inc., sought Chapter 11 protection Sept. 28, a day after it abruptly canceled flights and laid off 2,800 employees.
Braniff, which had launched ambitious expansion plans over the past year, blamed its difficulties on the collapse of expected financing. 

It was Braniff's second bankruptcy-law filing in a decade.
The carrier sought Chapter 11 protection in 1982, emerging with new owners -- the Pritzker family -- who sold it in 1988 to a group of real estate investors. 

A bankruptcy court in Orlando, Fla., where the case is being heard, approved Braniff's request to retain Merrill Lynch. 

Braniff currently operates 46 daily flights to 11 cities.
Before the filing, it flew to more than 40 cities.
