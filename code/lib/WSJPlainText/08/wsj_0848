Fujitsu Ltd. posted a modest 6.7% gain in unconsolidated pretax profit in the first half ended Sept. 30, the company said. 

Pretax profit for the Tokyo computer maker rose to 50.161 trillion yen ($354.4 million) from 47.013 trillion yen a year ago.
Net income rose 18% to 28.461 trillion yen, or 15.87 yen a share, from 24.213 trillion yen, or 13.81 yen a share. 

The company said falling sales in its communications division hurt results.
Sales from the division slipped 7.5% to 161.080 trillion yen.
A Fujitsu spokesman said the weaker performance reflected slipping sales to Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp., Japan's domestic telephone monopoly. 

Total sales rose 4.7% to 966.471 trillion yen. 

Sales of electrical devices rose about 19% to 147.874 trillion yen, while sales in the information systems division gained 5.4% to 657.517 trillion yen.
