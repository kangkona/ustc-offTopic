New Hampshire Yankee Co., operator of the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power facility, said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission fined it $50,000 in connection with improper procedures in shutting down the plant during low-power testing last June. 

Edward A. Brown, president of New Hampshire Yankee, said it accepts the decision and will pay the fine.
He noted that the NRC called the event an "aberration" and never questioned the safety of the plant. 

In June, the plant's No. 2 executive, George Thomas, was fired because of improper control-room procedures at the plant before the shutdown. 

New Hampshire Yankee is 35.6%-owned by Public Service Co. of New Hampshire.
