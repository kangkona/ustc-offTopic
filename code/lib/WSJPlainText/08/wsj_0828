Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission said the proposed #395 million ($637.7 million) acquisition of Tootal Group PLC by Coats Viyella PLC, a U.K. textile manufacturer, could go ahead pending certain conditions. 

The commission said Coats must first dispose of its interest in Britain's domestic sewing thread industry and its shares in the Gutermann Group. 

The panel was concerned that the merger of the two groups would damage competition in British markets for industrial and domestic sewing thread and clothing. 

Coats has offered one ordinary Coats share and 400 pence in cash for every four shares in Tootal, which is the equivalent of 138.4 pence per share.
