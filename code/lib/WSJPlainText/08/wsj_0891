Credit Lyonnais S.A. said it agreed to acquire slightly more than 50% of Thomson-CSF Finance S.A. in an asset swap between the two French state-controlled groups. 

The bank said it will acquire the stake in the finance unit of defense and electronics group Thomson-CSF S.A. in exchange for almost 14% of its own capital.
No value was given for the transaction, which will create the sort of financial-industrial tandem common in West Germany and Japan. 

Although Thomson's banking activities will become a Credit Lyonnais subsidiary, they are to remain a separate entity and, according to sources, will continue to handle Thomson's own international financing needs.
Thomson-CSF Finance, the largest finance unit of any French industrial company, also will gain access to products offered by Credit Lyonnais, France's secondbiggest commercial bank in terms of assets, behind Banque Nationale de Paris. 

The accord will strengthen Credit Lyonnais's corporate financial affairs because of Thomson-CSF Finance's expertise in using hedging and treasury-management products. 

Thomson-CSF Finance posted profit of 1.8 billion francs ($288.9 million) in 1988, an official said.
He added that Thomson consolidated earnings won't be affected by the accord.
Credit Lyonnais reported 1988 consolidated profit of 2.06 billion francs after payments to minority interests. 

Thomson common shares and Credit Lyonnais non-voting stock were suspended yesterday before the announcement at their respective Wednesday closing prices of 194.50 francs ($31.22) and 642 francs ($103.05) each.
They were expected to resume trading today.
