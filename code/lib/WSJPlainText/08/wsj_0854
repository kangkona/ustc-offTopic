Ford Motor Co. Ltd., the U.K. unit of Ford Motor Co., said it offered its hourly workers a 15% raise in wages over two years as a first offer in contract talks. 

A Ford spokesman said 33,000 manual workers at the company's 21 plants in the U.K. have been offered 8% in the first year and 7% in the second year. 

But Charlie Whelan, an official of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, said the offer was rejected by union leaders as "totally unacceptable." 

The Ford wage settlement will be watched closely as a barometer of wage inflation in the U.K.
The annual underlying average increase in wages is currently running at about 8.75%, and overall inflation at about 7.6%.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher urged companies not to give in to demands that would aggravate inflation. 

Union leaders earlier this month lodged a claim for a "significant" raise, aimed at bringing Ford's hourly wages in line with the motor company's European plants.
The unions haven't made a counter-demand to Ford.
They recently rejected Vauxhall Motors Ltd. 's offer of a 9.1% raise, made as part of a two-year package.
