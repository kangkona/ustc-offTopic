As expected, First Interstate Bancorp reported a net loss of $15.5 million for its third quarter because of hemorrhaging at its First Interstate Bank of Arizona unit. 

The Los Angeles-based bank holding company disclosed last Friday that it had taken a huge $350 million provision for loan losses at the Arizona bank, the result of the state's worsening real-estate market. 

In yesterday's report, First Interstate said its bank in Texas also reported a loss of $23.5 million for the quarter.
But it said that its consumer banks in Oregon, California, Nevada and Washington performed well during the quarter and that nonperforming assets at these banks declined by 14% over the year-ago period.
