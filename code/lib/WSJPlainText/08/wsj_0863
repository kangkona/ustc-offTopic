Paramount Pictures Corp., New York, named Arthur Cohen, executive vice president of advertising at Revlon Inc., as the new president of marketing for its motion picture group. 

Movie studios rarely turn outside the industry for marketing executives.
A few years ago, for example, Coca-Cola Co., which owns 49% of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., sent one of its soft drink marketing executives, Peter Sealey, to run marketing at the studio.
Mr. Sealey didn't stay long, however, leaving after a series of management changes.
Columbia is in the process of being acquired by Sony Corp. 

Mr. Cohen fills a post vacated earlier this year by Sidney Ganis when Mr. Ganis and Paramount's head of distribution, Barry London, were named co-presidents of the motion picture group.
Paramount Pictures is a unit of Paramount Communications Inc. 

Prior to joining Revlon in 1986, Mr. Cohen held a number of marketing and advertising posts.
From 1982 to 1985, he was president of the ill-fated Tele1st venture of the ABC Video Enterprises unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. Tele1st attempted to sell movies via a service that enabled subscribers with videocassette recorders to tape movies delivered on a special scrambled channel overnight.
