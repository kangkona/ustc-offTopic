Lawyers for former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Samuel Pierce say he again will refuse to answer questions from a congressional subcommittee investigating federal housing scandals. 

In a letter to Rep. Tom Lantos (D., Calif.), chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee on housing and employment, the lawyers said Mr. Pierce would invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination at hearings scheduled for today and Friday. 

On Sept. 26, Mr. Pierce invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to testify.
At that time, he said his lawyers hadn't been given enough time to prepare.
The letter sent yesterday to Mr. Lantos says Mr. Pierce "is concerned that there continues to be an atmosphere wherein he remains a target of the subcommittee's hearings." 

In the letter, lawyers Paul Perito, Robert Plotkin and Inez Smith say they "hope that sometime in the near future the present level of tension may be reduced such that Mr. Pierce can reconsider his present position and testify under fair and mutually agreeable circumstances."
