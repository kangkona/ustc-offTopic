Arnold C. Pohs was officially named president and chief executive officer of Cellular Inc., a provider of management, financing and operating services to cellular-telephone systems. 

Mr. Pohs, previously executive vice president and chief operating officer, was named interim president and chief executive officer after David M. Harrold, a company founder, resigned from the posts for personal reasons in August. 

Cellular said Robert J. Lunday Jr., its chairman and another founder, resigned from the company's board to pursue the sale of his telephone company, Big Sandy Telecommunications Inc.
A new director hasn't been named to fill that seat, which expires in 1992.
Mr. Pohs said the board probaby will elect a new chairman at its meeting Nov. 

In addition, the company said Monroe M. Rifkin, a cable television investor and consultant, was elected a director, filling a vacant seat that will expire in 1991.
The board currently has six members, but is expanding to nine, Mr. Pohs said.
