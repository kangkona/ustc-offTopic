Investors gave an unexpectedly warm welcome to Resolution Funding Corp. 's first auction of 30-year bonds, which helped lift the spirits of the entire bond market. 

Resolution Funding, the government agency created to raise cash to bail out the troubled thrift industry, received bids totaling $13 billion for the so-called bailout bonds.
It accepted $4.52 billion of the tenders at an average yield of 8.15%, slightly lower than analysts had expected. 

The bid-to-cover ratio on the bonds was 2.87 to 1, better than on the Treasury's own 30-year bonds in recent auctions.
The ratio, which reflects the number of bids received for each bid accepted, is used to gauge investor demand. 

"This was an excellent response to a new security," said Michael E. Basham, deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury. "We were very pleased." 

Treasury officials were also surprised.
Until yesterday, institutional investors had showed little interest in buying the securities.
After dealers complained that potential buyers were concerned about debt repayment, the Treasury released a statement yesterday reiterating that timely payments were guaranteed by the government.
Traders said the auction was saved by a small number of dealers who bought huge amounts of the bonds. 

"There's no doubt that the auction went better than expected," said William Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
The fact that bond prices were firm prior to and after the auction was a sign that "the market is in very good shape." Bond prices often fall right before new supply is released. 

Traders said a strong market tone was set early in the day when a bid to buy $1 billion of long-term bonds hit the market.
Bond dealers identified the buyer as Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru International Inc., a Japanese brokerage firm that purchased the bonds on behalf of a client. 

Eishi Wakabayashi, a Nippon Kangyo executive vice president, confirmed that the firm "bought quite a bit" yesterday and last week, but he declined to elaborate.
Last Thursday, the firm was said to have purchased close to $2 billion of long-term bonds. 

Joel Kazis, head of government trading at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., said the billion dollar bid "helped to support the market going into the Refcorp auction" and "showed that there are real buyers for long bonds." 

The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which jumped 1/2 point on the Nippon Kangyo bid, ended 1/8 point higher, or up $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount.
Mortgage-backed securities rose less than 1/8 point, but municipal bonds ended unchanged to slightly lower.
Investment-grade corporate issues and junk bonds were unchanged. 

At the Resolution Funding auction, traders said much of the appetite for the new 30-year bonds came from dealers who are "stripping" the bonds and repackaging them as zero-coupon securities. 

Strips are created by separating the interest payment portion of the bond from the principal portion, called the corpus.
The two pieces are then sold separately at a deep discount to their face amount.
Zero-coupon securities pay no interest until maturity, with the return to investors consisting primarily of the bond discount. 

Among the big buyers at yesterday's auction was Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Jack Norris, a Drexel executive vice president, said the firm bought a sizable share of the bonds, but he wouldn't be specific.
He said Drexel intends to strip at least $500 million of the bonds the firm purchased. "We've had very strong strip demand" from institutional investors, he said. 

Meanwhile, the market paid close attention to comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who testified before a congressional hearing.
However, credit market analysts were unable to discern many clues about the future course of monetary policy from the Fed chairman's remarks.
Among other things, Mr. Greenspan said he endorses a bill by Rep. Stephen Neal (D., N.C.) that would require the Fed to pursue policies aimed at eliminating inflation within five years. 

Treasury, Agency Securities 

Treasury bonds ended with small gains yesterday, which was better than some economists had expected considering the large amount of new supply that has hit the market this week.
Including yesterday's $4.52 billion of Resolution Funding bonds, the government has sold $30 billion in new securities this week. 

Today, investors will be scrutinizing the government's report on gross national product for the third quarter.
Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report expect real GNP to have grown at a 2.5% annual rate in the third quarter, about the same as in the second quarter. 

The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was quoted late at 102 22/32 to yield 7.88%, compared with 102 18/32 to yield 7.89% Tuesday.
The latest 10-year notes were quoted at 100 24/32 to yield 7.87%, compared with 100 22/32 to yield 7.88%. 

Here are details of yesterday's Resolution Funding auction: 

Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value.
Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. 

The bonds are dated Oct. 30 and mature Oct. 15, 2019. 

Corporate Issues 

Several new issues hit the corporate market yesterday. 

Among the new issues was Arco Chemical Co. 's $100 million in 30-year debentures, which were priced to yield 9.50%. 

In the junk bond market, Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. issued $300 million of zero-coupon convertible notes, also known as liquid yield option notes.
The notes, underwritten by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, were priced at $308.32 per $1,000 note to yield 8%.
The size of the offering was increased from the originally planned $250 million redemption amount. 

In secondary trading, prices of investment grade and high-yield, high-risk junk bonds ended unchanged yesterday. 

However, there were some notable exceptions.
Certain SCI Television Inc. junk bonds fell after the company announced a debt exchange offer.
Meanwhile, junk bonds of Public Service Co. of New Hampshire surged on news of a bidding war. 

As expected, Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. postponed a $1.15 billion junk bond offering for TW Services Inc. Donaldson Lufkin said takeover-related financing is being restructured to include more equity and less debt.
The investment banker said the new deal under consideration calls for $600 million to $700 million in high-yield debt to be offered. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities 

Mortgage securities ended 2/32 to 3/32 point higher after giving up early gains of as much as 8/32. 

Government National Mortgage Association 8% securities for November delivery finished at 94 1/4, up 3/32; 9% securities at 98 18/32, up 3/32; 9 1/2% securities at 100 18/32, up 3/32; and 10% securities at 102 14/32, up 3/32.
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9% securities were at 97 23/32, up 2/32. 

The Ginnie Mae 9% issue was yielding 9.32% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note held at 1.46 percentage points. 

In derivative markets, the Federal National Mortgage Association issued a $300 million real estate mortgage investment conduit backed by its 9% securities through Goldman, Sachs & Co. 

Municipals 

Bidding for a $223 million sell list and a handful of medium-sized new issues dominated an otherwise uneventful session. 

Active dollar bond issues were mostly unchanged to off 1/8 in light late dealings. 

The 176-item bid list was made up largely of bonds due in eight years or less, with most maturing within five years.
Many are state general obligations. 

In the new issue arena, underwriters led by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. set the preliminary pricing for $80 million of Michigan general obligation bonds, the first offering of such debt by the state since 1986.
The sale was designed by state officials to stimulate savings by residents. 

The issue launches an $800 million bond program, given the go-ahead by voters in November 1988, to fund environmental protection and recreation projects. 

Another Shearson group had the winning bid for $134.8 million of wastewater system improvement revenue bonds issued by the Trinity River Authority of Texas.
The bonds yield from 6.30% in 1992 to 7.25% in 2016.
An unsold balance of $22.2 million remained in late order-taking. 

Foreign Bonds 

Most foreign government bond prices rose in light trading. 

Mark bonds rose about 1/8 point.
The 7% bond due October 1999 rose 0.12 to 100.05 to yield 6.99%, while the 6 3/4% notes due July 1994 rose 0.05 to 97.75 to yield 7.32%. 

Britain's 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 rose 15/32 to 112 21/32 to yield 9.94%, while the 11 3/4% notes due 1991 rose 1/8 to 98 25/32 to yield 12.78%. 

Japan's No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers' screens at 95.53, up 0.31, to yield 5.355%.
