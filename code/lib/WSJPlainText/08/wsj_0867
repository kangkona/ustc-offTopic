Rio Algom Ltd. said it agreed to acquire Uranium Resources Inc. for $2.55 a share, or about $66 million. 

Rio Algom, a Toronto-based mining concern, said the transaction is subject to a comprehensive review of the Dallas-based company's business and the signing of a definitive agreement. 

Uranium Resources earlier this month said it had signed a non-binding letter of intent for the acquisition of all of its shares but didn't identify the proposed purchaser.
The closely held uranium producer also said it agreed to pay Rio Algom $2 million plus expenses if the proposed deal isn't completed and Uranium Resources enters certain other transactions. 

Rio said the proposed acquisition reflects its expectation that uranium prices will begin to pick up in coming months from their recent depressed state. 

Separately, Rio Algom said it agreed to pay Whittaker Corp. of Los Angeles $30 million to acquire Whittaker Metals, a metals distribution business with four facilities in the Southwest region. 

Rio said Whittaker Metals' geographical base complements Rio's Vincent Metals business, with outlets mainly in central and southeastern states.
