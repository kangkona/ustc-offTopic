Two exchanges' new stock "basket" products got off to a slow start yesterday. 

The New York Stock Exchange's Exchange Stock Portfolio, which allows investors to trade all 500 stocks in Standard & Poor's index in a single transaction, received permanent regulatory approval Wednesday.
However, the Securities and Exchange Commission will review three rules regarding Big Board's basket trading over the next six months. 

The SEC also approved the Chicago Board Options Exchange's basket product.
Both exchanges will compete for institutional business in the months ahead, and one probably will emerge as the dominant market for stock baskets. 

Only nine ESP contracts traded on the Big Board -- equivalent to about one million shares of stock, with a value of about $45 million. "It was a slow start, but we expected it would be," said Big Board President Richard Grasso. "We were generally pleased with the way the systems acted." 

At the CBOE, 14 baskets traded -- the equivalent of about 500,000 shares with a value of about $24 million.
The CBOE's basket requires a minimum of $1.7 million a trade, compared with a $5 million minimum for the Big Board basket. 

David Hall, vice president at the CBOE, said five to six firms traded the stock basket product, located on the floor of the CBOE near the S&P 500-stock index options pit.
