Manville Corp. said it will build a $24 million power plant to provide electricity to its Igaras pulp and paper mill in Brazil. 

The company said the plant will ensure that it has adequate energy for the mill and will reduce the mill's energy costs.
Manville said it expects the plant to begin operating at the end of 1991.
