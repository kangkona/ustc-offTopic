After being whipsawed by a volatile stock market, Treasury bonds closed higher.
But junk bonds took more hits. 

Early in the day, bond dealers said trading volume was heavy as large institutional investors scrambled to buy long-term Treasury bonds on speculation that the stock market's volatility would lead to a "flight-to-quality" rally.
That happens when nervous stock investors dump equities and buy Treasurys, which are higher in quality and thus considered safe. 

"Some retail accounts, such as commercial banks and pension funds, wanted to get on the bandwagon before it was too late," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp., Minneapolis. 

At one point, the Dow Jones Industrial average fell about 80 points on news that UAL Corp. decided to remain independent.
In response, Treasury prices soared 1 1/8 points, or about $11.25 for each $1,000 face amount.
But the gains in Treasury bonds were pared as stocks staged a partial recovery.
The industrial average ended at 2659.22, down 3.69 points. 

Economists said the bond market's strength also is a sign that investors expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates amid growing evidence that the economy is slowing.
While they don't expect the Fed to move right away, they say the case for lower rates is building.
Yesterday, for example, the Commerce Department reported that new orders for durable goods fell 0.1%, while the nation's auto makers reported lackluster mid-October sales. 

The Treasury's 30-year bond ended over 1/4 point higher.
Municipal, mortgage-backed and investment-grade corporate bonds rose 1/8 to 1/2 point. 

But high-yield, high-risk bonds fell 1/4 to 1/2 point with the stock market early in the session and never recovered.
According to a trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the hardest hit junk bonds were those issued by RJR Holdings Capital Corp., which are the easiest to sell.
RJR's 14.70% bonds due 2007 fell 2 1/2 points. 

Trading activity in the junk market was extremely light as dealers couldn't find enough buyers to match sellers. "While the stock market was falling, most {junk bond holders} were just watching it not knowing what to do," said Paul Suckow, director of fixed-income securities at Oppenheimer Management Corp. "It was like driving down the highway watching a wreck.
Everybody was rubber-necking." 

Adding to the junk market's jitters were reports that Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. is having trouble structuring a $1.6 billion offering for TW Food Services Inc. and will postpone or even cancel the issue.
TW is the largest franchisee of Hardee's, a fast-food restaurant, and operates several other food chains.
Donaldson Lufkin wouldn't comment. 

Credit analysts said investors are nervous about the issue because they say the company's ability to meet debt payments is dependent on too many variables, including the sale of assets and the need to mortgage property to retire some existing debt.
Also, the TW offering includes interest-deferred and pay-in-kind securities, which are currently unpopular. 

Meanwhile, investors turned a cold shoulder to the Treasury's sale of $10 billion of new two-year notes yesterday. 

"It's not too surprising that the auction was sloppy, given the volatility in the bond market because of stocks," said Robert T. McGee, a senior vice president at Tokai Bank Ltd. "People are looking past supply to lower interest rates, but they're also worried about being whipsawed by the volatility in the stock market." 

The new two-year notes were priced with an average yield of 7.74%.
That was higher than the 7.71% to 7.73% average yield that traders had expected.
In when-issued trading, the notes were quoted at a price to yield 7.78%. 

Sluggish demand was also evidenced by the weak 2.41-to-1 bid-to-cover ratio, which was lower than the average 2.79-to-1 ratio at the last 12 similar auctions.
The ratio, which reflects the number of bids the Treasury receives for each bid accepted, is used to gauge investor demand. 

Dealers said players shied away from the note sale because they were concerned that prices at the time of the auction might erode if the stock market staged a recovery, which, in fact, did happen. 

Individual and Japanese participation in the auction was disappointing, according to dealers. 

"Interest by Japanese investors was limited," said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. "They are typically not active in two-year note auctions, but today's participation could be viewed as lighter-than-normal." 

However, Mr. Moran added that the Japanese generally have a positive view of the U.S. bond market because of expectations that the dollar will remain strong and interest rates will decline.
He said, "Possibly, they're waiting to buy at the (quarterly) refunding" of government debt to be held next month by the Treasury. 

A trader at a Japanese firm estimated that the Japanese purchased no more than 10% of the two-year notes. 

Treasury, Agency Securities 

Today investors will focus on the long-awaited auction of $4.5 billion of 30-year bonds by Resolution Funding Corp. 

The initial bond offering by the new government agency, which was created to help rescue the nation's troubled thrifts, isn't expected to see robust demand. 

A small yield premium over comparable Treasurys and a lack of liquidity is hampering dealers' efforts to drum up interest in the so-called bailout bonds.
In when-issued trading, the Refcorp bonds were quoted at a price to yield 8.17%. 

Yesterday, the benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at 102 18/32 to yield 7.89%, compared with 102 9/32 to yield 7.93% on Monday.
The latest 10-year Treasury was quoted at 100 22/32 to yield 7.88%, compared with 100 17/32 to yield 7.9%. 

Short-term rates were unchanged to slightly lower.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was quoted at 7.52% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.75%, while the rate on six-month Treasury bills was quoted at 7.47% for a yield of 7.85%. 

Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value.
Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. 

Corporate Issues 

Several blue-chip companies tapped the new-issue market yesterday to take advantage of falling interest rates. 

Three of the largest offerings, by Exxon Capital Corp., Xerox Corp. and Citicorp, were underwritten by groups led by Salomon Brothers Inc. Exxon Capital, long-rumored to be a potential debt issuer, offered $200 million of 10-year notes priced to yield 8.31%.
Citicorp issued $200 million of seven-year notes priced to yield 8.82%, and Xerox priced $150 million of six-year notes to yield 8.85%. 

Meanwhile, International Business Machines Corp. paved the way for a visit to the credit markets by filing a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission for $800 million in new debt.
This is in addition to IBM's existing shelf registration under which $200 million in debt securities are available for issuance. 

In secondary trading, investment-grade corporate bonds ended 1/8 to 1/4 higher. 

Municipals 

Actively traded municipal bonds ended 1/4 to 1/2 point higher in brisk trading, despite a flood of new supply. 

New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 finished 1/4 point stronger at 98 1/2 bid, to yield 7.32%. 

Traders said municipals were underpinned by influences including the climb in Treasury issue prices.
Also, municipal bonds lured buying because the stock market remains wobbly, traders contended.
Mainly, though, it was a favorable outlook for yesterday's new supply that propped up municipals, some traders said. 

Among the new issues was Massachusetts's $230 million of general obligation bonds.
The bonds were won by a Goldman, Sachs & Co. group with a true interest cost of 7.17%.
They were priced to yield from 6.00% in 1990 to 7.20% in 2009. 

The Massachusetts deal had an unsold balance of $84.3 million in late trading, the underwriter said. 

Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities 

Mortgage securities gained 3/32 to 9/32 point after a hectic session, with Government National Mortgage Association 8% securities as the standout issue. 

The Ginnie Mae issue rose amid talk of large purchases of the securities by institutional investors. 

The derivative markets remained active as one new issue was priced and talk circulated about more offerings in the next day or two.
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. issued a $500 million real estate mortgage investment conduit backed by its 8 1/2% securities. 

In the asset-backed market, a big offering of Ford Motor Credit Corp. auto-loan securities was increased in size after strong institutional demand.
The deal by the Ford Motor Co. unit, priced Monday, was increased to $3.05 billion from $2.58 billion. 

Among major pass-through issues, Ginnie Mae 9% securities for November delivery ended at 98 15/32, up 5/32, after touching an early high of 98 27/32; 8% securities were at 94 5/32, up 9/32; 9 1/2% securities at 100 15/32, up 4/32; and 10% securities at 102 11/32, up 3/32.
Freddie Mac 9% securities were at 97 21/32, up 5/32. 

The Ginnie Mae 9% issue was yielding 9.34% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note held at 1.46 percentage points. 

Foreign Bonds 

The Eurodollar bond market sprang to life late in the European trading session after the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled. 

Eurodollar bonds are often issued by foreign corporations, but interest and principal are paid in dollars.
The bonds ended about 1/2 point higher yesterday. 

Prices of European government bonds also rose as U.S. stocks declined. 

West Germany's 7% issue due October 1999 rose 0.13 point to 99.93 to yield 7.01%, while the 6 3/4% issue due July 1994 rose 0.05 to 97.70 to yield 7.33%. 

Britain's 11 3/4% Treasury bond due 2003/2007 rose 17/32 to 112 6/32 to yield 10.05%, while the 12% notes due 1995 rose 11/32 to 104 2/32 to yield 10.93%. 

In Japan, government bond prices fell.
The No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers' screens at 95.22, down 0.17 point, to yield 5.41%.
