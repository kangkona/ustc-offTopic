Japan's production of cars, trucks and buses in September fell 4.1% from a year ago to 1,120,317 units because of a slip in exports, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association said. 

Domestic demand continues to grow, but its contribution to higher production was sapped in September by the estimated 2% fall in imports, accompanied by a growing tendency for Japanese manufacturers to build vehicles overseas, according to the association. 

The association said domestic demand grew 8.8% in September. 

Demand has been growing consistently under the encouragement of pro-consumption government policies, an association spokesman said.
He also said the introduction of a 3% consumption tax in April has helped sales.
The new tax, though a source of general resentment among Japanese taxpayers, replaced a higher commodities tax that applied to automobiles. 

Japanese domestic motor-vehicle sales rose 12% in September, the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said earlier this month.
The manufacturers' association will issue statistics on vehicle exports later this month. 

Production of cars rose to 801,835 units in September, a 5.5% increase from a year earlier.
Midsized cars accounted for the greatest growth in units, rising 62,872 units to 134,550 units, or 88%.
Minicar output more than tripled.
Manufacturers produced 46,835 of the vehicles -- which have engines of 500 cubic centimeters or less -- an increase of 31,777 units. 

Total truck production fell 22% from a year earlier to 315,546 units.
Minitruck production fell 13% to 94,243 units. 

Bus production also slipped, by 49% from a year earlier to 2,936 units.
The association spokesman said bus production has declined since January, but couldn't offer an explanation for the fall.
Auto production for the first half of the fiscal year, which began in August, totaled 6,379,884 units, the association said.
Half-year production was up 3.4% compared with the same period a year earlier.
