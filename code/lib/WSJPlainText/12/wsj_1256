Your Sept. 26 "Politics & Policy" article about William Bennett's Emergency Drug Plan for Washington gives the impression that the FBI has not been nor is actively involved.
This is not the case. 

The FBI is very supportive of and an active participant in Mr. Bennett's initiative.
It was agreed at the outset of the Washington Drug Initiative that the FBI's role would be to continue targeting the major drug traffickers through our National Drug Strategy.
Through these investigations we do not focus on the street drug user, but rather we target and attack major drug-trafficking organizations that control a large segment of the drug market.
The trial of Raful Edmond III in Washington serves to highlight our efforts in this area and the results achieved through our excellent working relationship with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). 

The FBI's role is to complement the D.C. initiative through not only these major trafficking investigations, but also by providing a full range of services through various task forces and our contacts with local police squads handling drug-related crimes.
In fact, we have agents assigned full time to assist the MPD in drug-related crimes such as homicide and other crimes of violence.
