Ronald B. Koenig, 55 years old, was named a senior managing director of the Gruntal & Co. brokerage subsidiary of this insurance and financial-services firm.
Mr. Koenig will build the corporate-finance and investment-banking business of Gruntal, which has primarily been a retail-based firm.
He was chairman and co-chief executive officer of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co. until July, when he was named co-chairman of the investment-banking firm along with Howard L. Blum Jr., who then became the sole chief executive.
Yesterday, Mr. Blum, 41, said he wasn't aware of plans at Ladenburg to name a co-chairman to succeed Mr. Koenig and said the board would need to approve any appointments or title changes.
Mr. Blum added he wasn't surprised Mr. Koenig resigned, but his departure was "nothing that we desired or worked for." Mr. Koenig said: "I just got a tremendous offer from Gruntal."
