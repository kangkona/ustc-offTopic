CONTROL DATA Corp. said it is offering to purchase the $154.2 million amount of its 12 3/4% senior notes due June 15, 1991, at par, plus accrued interest to the Dec. 8 purchase date.
The Minneapolis computer systems and services concern said the offer is required under the senior note indenture as a result of Control Data's recent sale of its disk drive subsidiary, Imprimis, to Seagate Technology Inc.
