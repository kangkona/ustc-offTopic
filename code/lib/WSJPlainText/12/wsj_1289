Harken Energy Corp. of Dallas said it will drop its $11.75-a-share, or $190 million, offer for Tesoro Petroleum Corp. if the two companies don't have an agreement to merge by Dec. 15. 

Harken, which made its offer in August, said it still is awaiting a response to its offer from Tesoro's board. 

Harken also said that its financing from Bankers Trust Co. has been extended until Dec. 15 to give Tesoro's board time to consider the offer at a Tesoro board meeting scheduled for mid-November. 

Harken, which owns about 800 retail gas stations, has said it is particularly interested in Tesoro's refinery because it would fill a gap in its business.
However, Tesoro, based in Houston, already has rejected a suitor in the past year.
