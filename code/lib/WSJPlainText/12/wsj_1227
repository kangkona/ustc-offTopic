Asarco Inc., continuing its effort to refocus its business, ended its involvement in asbestos mining in the third quarter and said it would stop mining and selling coal by year end. 

The mining, metal and specialty-chemical concern said combined revenue for asbestos and coal was about $40 million of the company's total revenue in 1988 of $1.98 billion.
Richard de J. Osborne, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said the company's "decisions to get out of asbestos and high-sulfur coal continue the process of simplifying and focusing the company in areas with a better future." 

Asarco also reported third-quarter net income rose 14%, to $52.7 million, or $1.25 a share, from a restated $46.2 million, or $1.10 a share, a year earlier.
Asarco said the gain reflected continued strength in prices for refined copper, lead and zinc, and higher equity earnings in Mexico Desarrollo Industrial Minero S.A., a Mexican mining company in which Asarco has a 34% stake.
The 1988 results were restated for accounting-rules changes. 

Sales rose 4.5% to $522.3 million from $499.4 million. 

In August, Asarco, through its Lac d'Amiante du Quebec subsidiary, sold its remaining one-third interest in an asbestos mining limited partnership in Canada for $11.7 million.
Asarco said it plans to shut down or sell its Rapatee coal mine and will end its involvement in southern Illinois strip mining.
The company said that it is discussing a management-employee buy-out of the facility, but that it would stop mining and selling coal at year end when existing sales contracts expire, regardless of the outcome of those talks. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Asarco fell $1.375 to close at $31.75.
