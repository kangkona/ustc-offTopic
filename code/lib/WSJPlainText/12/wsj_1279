Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp called on the Federal Reserve System to lower interest rates. 

In a speech to the Mortgage Bankers Association, Mr. Kemp broke the administration's public silence on the Fed and complained that "interest rates are too high." 

"I am convinced that a monetary policy for this country that would return interest rates to the historical level of 4% or 5% would have not only an immediate impact on housing starts, the housing stock, our industry in America, the refurbishing of our industrial system, it would help the Third World economies considerably and it would particularly have a favorable impact upon our budget deficit," Mr. Kemp said. 

The Fed recently eased credit by lowering the bellwether federal funds interest rate to 8 3/4% from about 9%. 

Bush administration officials say inflation is under control.
With economic growth slowing, they say they believe the Fed should ease credit even further.
But for the most part, officials have avoided expressing those views in public, fearing they would unnecessarily antagonize the Fed.
