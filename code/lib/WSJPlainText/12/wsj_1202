Times Mirror Co. said third-quarter net income fell 13% to $70.1 million, or 54 cents a share, compared with net income of $81 million, or 62 cents a share, a year earlier. 

The Los Angeles media concern said that the year-ago period included a $26.5 million gain from the sale of assets, primarily timberlands. 

Revenue was $873.9 million, up 7.3% from $814.8 million. 

Stronger results from the company's broadcast and cable television units and professional and textbook publishing divisions, plus increased advertising at the company's largest newspaper, the Los Angeles Times, offset advertising declines in the company's newspapers in the Eastern U.S., the company said. 

"Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the outlook for the newspaper group remains guarded, with no improvement yet seen in operating trends in our Eastern markets," said Robert F. Erburu, Times Mirror's chairman and chief executive.
