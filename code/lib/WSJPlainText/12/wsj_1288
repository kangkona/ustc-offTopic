Japan's Big Four securities firms posted first-half unconsolidated results that mirrored softer performance as a result of slower turnover on the Tokyo Stock Exchange during July and August. 

Figures for the period ended Sept. 30 for the four largest brokerage firms -- Nomura Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co., Yamaichi Securities Co. and Nikko Securities -- also reflected a changeover to a fiscal year ending March 31, replacing the 12-month term formerly finishing Sept. 30. 

As a result, brokerage house officials said, appropriate comparisons from the same period a year earlier were unavailable.
Operating profit, pretax profit and net income results, however, were provided for the immediately preceding six-month period. 

The statistics follow a year-on-year rebound in consolidated and unconsolidated results in the full fiscal year ended in March 1989, recovering from dismal results in the prior fiscal year as a result of the October 1987 stock market crash. 

Nomura said its pretax profits inched up 0.9% to 248.91 billion yen (US$1.75 billion) from 246.60 billion yen in the six months ended March 31. 

Total operating profit fell 3.1% to 486.1 billion yen from 501.61 billion yen.
Net income, however, rose 3.7% to 107.87 billion yen from 103.98 billion yen.
Per-share net rose to 55.10 yen from 54.51 yen. 

Daiwa said its pretax profits surged 9.6% to 171.04 billion yen from 156.12 billion yen in the preceding six-month term. 

Operating profit rose 5.5% to 332.38 billion yen from 315.12 billion yen.
Net income jumped 21% to 79.03 billion yen from 65.53 billion yen.
Per-share net rose to 62.04 yen from 51.50 yen. 

Yamaichi said its pretax profit increased 8.9% to 117.94 billion yen from 108.28 billion yen.
Operating profit rose 5.3% to 279.75 billion yen from 265.79 billion yen.
Net income surged 21% to 55.59 billion yen from 46.02 billion yen.
Per-share net rose to 47.46 yen from 39.31 yen. 

Nikko's pretax profit rose 1.6% to 130.25 billion yen from 128.19 billion yen. 

Operating profit rose 4% to 293.29 billion yen from 282.08 billion yen.
Net income rose 23% to 63.52 billion yen from 51.65 billion yen.
Per-share net rose to 44.08 yen from 36.13 yen.
