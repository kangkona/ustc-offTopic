The Food and Drug Administration banned all imports of mushrooms from China in response to a rash of food-poisoning outbreaks linked to canned Chinese mushrooms. 

"The agency has concluded that contamination may be widespread throughout the mushroom-processing industry in China," an FDA spokesman said yesterday.
The agency won't allow mushrooms that were canned or packed in brine at any Chinese plant to enter the U.S. until "satisfactory sanitation-control measures are implemented in China to prevent" bacterial contamination. 

On May 19, the FDA began detaining Chinese mushrooms in 68-ounce cans after more than 100 people in Mississippi, New York and Pennsylvania became ill from eating tainted mushrooms.
In subsequent tests, the agency found smaller-size cans from several Chinese plants to be similarly contaminated. 

The outbreaks were traced to staphylococcus aureus, a type of bacteria that produces a toxin capable of surviving the high temperatures used in canning vegetables.
A recall of the mushrooms blamed for the food poisoning began in early March. 

In 1987, China exported 65 million pounds of mushrooms, valued at $47 million, to the U.S.
The shipments went mostly to food-service distributors that supply pizzerias and restaurants. 

A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy here said that the Beijing government has taken "many effective measures" to stop the mushroom contamination and is further investigating the underlying causes.
He predicted the problem will be solved "very soon."
