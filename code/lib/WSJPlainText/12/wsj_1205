Color Systems Technology Inc., Los Angeles, said its major creditor, General Electric Pension Trust, agreed to convert $11.8 million of debt owed into 25% of Color System's fully diluted common stock. 

The agreement also calls for General Electric Pension, a unit of General Electric Co., to receive as much as 10% of Color Systems' fully diluted common stock, depending on the proceeds from the sale of the AEI Film Library and its receivables.
General Electric Pension took control of the 85-title library last month after Color Systems defaulted on the loan. 

The agreement depends on Color Systems' ability to win similar concessions from other creditors.
Buddy Young, president, said the company expects to conclude negotiations with other creditors within 60 days. 

Color Systems, which converts black-and-white film to color videotape, posted a loss of $7.1 million, or $1.32 a share, on revenue of $10.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30.
Its stock fell 12.5 cents, to $2.125, in American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
