MCA Inc. said its toy-making unit agreed to buy Buddy L Corp., producer of a line of toy vehicles and preschool products. 

The price wasn't disclosed, but an executive of LJN Toys Ltd., the MCA unit, said the closely held Buddy L had annual sales in excess of $20 million.
The 40-year-old Buddy L concern, based in New York, designs and develops toys under the names "Buddy L" and "My First Buddy," he said. 

MCA said it expects the proposed transaction to be completed "no later than Nov. 10."
