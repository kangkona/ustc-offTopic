Computer Associates International Inc. reported earnings for the second quarter, ended Sept. 30, plummeted 66%, primarily because of the acquisition of Cullinet Software Inc. 

The nation's largest software company earned $9.6 million, or five cents a share, compared with $28 million, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 5% to $282 million from $268.3 million. 

The drop in earnings had been anticipated by most Wall Street analysts, but the results were reported after the market closed.
Computer Associates closed at $13.625, down 25 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

Anthony Wang, president, attributed the drop to the disruption of the company's business resulting from the prolonged process of acquiring Cullinet.
The acquisition was completed in September. 

In August, the company warned investors that the acquisition was being delayed, and many customers were holding off on purchase decisions until the takeover was completed.
The delays mainly affected sales of data base management products, a core area for both Computer Associates and Cullinet, as well as sales of other products as part of package sales.
