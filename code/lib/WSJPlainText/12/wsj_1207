Rubbermaid Inc., reflecting strong earnings growth, boosted its quarterly dividend 18%, to 13 cents a share from 11 cents. 

The maker of household products said the new dividend is payable Dec. 1 to shares of record Nov. 10. 

Separately, the company's board adopted a proposal to amend its 1986 shareholder rights plan, further insulating the company from takeover. 

Rubbermaid officials said they aren't aware of any effort to take over the company, but believed the shareholder plan needed to be strengthened. "The board has stated repeatedly that Rubbermaid should be independent," said Walter W. Williams, Rubbermaid president. 

Some changes to the plan were minor adjustments, but the most significant was an amendment that provides that if any investor holds 25% or more of Rubbermaid's voting securities, each right held by others would entitle the holder to buy Rubbermaid shares with a market value of twice the right's exercise price. 

Mr. Williams said the exercise price is $125, meaning holders would have the right to buy $250 of Rubbermaid stock for half price, diluting the investor's 25% stake. 

For the third quarter, Rubbermaid earned $32.6 million, or 44 cents a share, up 16% from $28.1 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose 9.7% to $351.5 million from $320.4 million. 

Rubbermaid shares closed yesterday at $33.875, off 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
