Designer Sandra Garratt filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Code protection, saying that her cash flow had been cut off. 

The designer, whose line of modular, one-size-fits-all clothing has spawned a host of clones, has been in a dispute with her latest licensee, Jerell Inc. for several months. 

Ms. Garratt was the subject of a Wall Street Journal article in March. 

The designer's attorney, Molly Bartholow, said that Ms. Garratt was forced to start bankruptcy-law proceedings because Jerell began withholding her royalty payments last month. 

Jerell paid Ms. Garratt royalties for the line known as Multiples by Sandra Garratt, which are sold primarily through department stores.
Ms. Garratt sued the Dallas apparel maker earlier this year, charging that Jerell developed and marketed clothing lines fashioned after her designs, in violation of their contract.
That lawsuit is still pending. 

Jerell couldn't immediately be reached for comment. 

Ms. Garratt's assets and liabilities weren't disclosed.
