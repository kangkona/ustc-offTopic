The Philippine merchandise trade deficit widened to $1.71 billion during the first eight months of 1989 from $807 million a year earlier. 

Imports continued to outpace Philippine exports, despite gains in shipments abroad, the government National Statistics Office said. 

Exports reached $5.12 billion, up from $4.52 billion a year earlier, while imports rose to $6.81 billion from $5.33 billion. 

The trade deficit in the first eight months is already wider than the trade gap of $1.09 billion for all of 1988. 

Analysts expect the trade gap for the year to surpass $2 billion as demand for capital equipment and raw materials continues to push imports higher.
