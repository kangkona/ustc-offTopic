Texaco Inc. reported an 11% increase in third-quarter earnings, which it attributed partly to the company's massive restructuring after it emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings 18 months ago. 

Sun Co. also reported higher earnings.
Meanwhile, like many other oil companies hurt by less-profitable downstream businesses, Mobil Corp., Shell Oil Co. and Chevron Corp. reported lower quarterly earnings. 

Texaco 

Texaco's exploration and production earnings improved as a result of its streamlining of those operations as it sold many of its marginal producing properties over the past 18 months.
An increase in production at some major oil fields in the North Sea, which had been knocked out by an explosion in July 1988, also aided results.
The sale of a portion of refining and marketing operations to Saudi Arabia helped alleviate the decline in earnings from that business. 

"The company has been completely revamped," said Frank Knuettel, analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. 

Third-quarter net income at Texaco rose to $305 million from $274 million last year.
Revenue declined 3.4%, to $8.4 billion from $8.7 billion.
Per-share earnings declined to $1.10 a share from $1.12 a share, largely because of 21 million additional shares issued to retire $1 billion of debt.
Per-share earnings also shrank because of dividends on a new series of preferred stock. 

Sun Sun Co. 's net income climbed 18% to $85 million, or 80 cents a share, from $72 million, or 67 cents a share.
Revenue increased 11%, to $2.73 billion from $2.46 billion. 

Sun said some of the growth reflects higher earnings in the oil sands operation of Suncor, a majority-owned Canadian subsidiary.
Chairman Robert McClements Jr. said the synthetic crude oil production from the facility rose even as the price for that oil increased.
Overseas exploration and production results also improved because of additional output from the North Sea Magnus Field, a portion of which was acquired by Sun earlier this year.
Results declined, however, in Sun's refining and marketing and coal businesses. 

Shell Oil 

Profits of Shell, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, tumbled $24 million, or 6.6%, to $340 million, despite a gain of $30 million from an insurance settlement.
President Frank Richardson attributed the decline to lower natural gas prices, which countered higher earnings from the crude oil sector of Shell's exploration and production operation.
Shaving away some of the gain in that unit was a decline in U.S. oil production to 502,000 barrels of oil a day during the quarter from 527,000 barrels a day last year. 

Shell's chemical earnings fell by $67 million, to $137 million, reflecting lower margins and less demand for commodity chemicals. 

Mobil 

Net income at Mobil Corp. slipped 4.5% to $532 million, or $1.30 a share, from $557 million, or $1.36 a share.
Revenue declined $518 million, to $13.63 billion. 

Earnings included a one-time gain of $192 million on a property transaction in Hong Kong.
Exploration and production profits slumped $40 million due to a provision for restructuring costs.
The restructuring will take place over a two-year period and will involve the transfer and layoff of employees in U.S. operations to reduce costs and focus efforts in other areas. 

Last year, third-quarter earnings included a $157 million gain from foreign tax rate changes and a loss from a $65 million write-off of reserves. 

Chevron 

Chevron's net income fell 0.7%, to $417 million, or $1.22 a share, from $420 million, or $1.23 a share.
Results included a $37 million gain from the sale of rights from Chevron's investment in Amax Inc., and a loss of $30 million from the sale of California oil and gas properties.
Revenue rose 11%, to $8 billion from $7.2 billion. 

Chevron said higher crude oil prices boosted profits from production operations, but margins in refining and marketing declined.
Profits from U.S. exploration and production operations totaled $58 million, after the property sale loss, compared with a year-earlier $44 million loss that included a $16 million reorganization charge. 

Refining and marketing operations earned $130 million in the quarter this year, compared with earnings of $186 million a year earlier that included $18 million in charges for environmental programs.
Foreign earnings fell to $180 million from $182 million that included a $48 million gain from lower Canadian and Australian taxes.
Chemical profits fell to $78 million from $98 million.
