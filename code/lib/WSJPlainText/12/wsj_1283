Eaton Corp. had a 26% drop in third-quarter profit mainly because of lower sales of truck parts, its largest and most profitable single business. 

Sales of medium and heavy-duty trucks continue to lag previous-year rates, leading Eaton to expect fourth-quarter net income to fall below year-earlier levels, said Stephen R. Hardis, vice chairman and chief financial and administrative officer.
He declined to make a specific earnings estimate. 

Third-quarter net was $40 million, or $1.04 a share, from $54.4 million, or $1.47 a share, a year ago.
Sales rose 2.8% to $864.1 million, from $840.4 million. 

The quarter net was below analyst expectations mainly because truck-parts sales didn't rebound in September from the summer doldrums as they usually do, said Patrick E. Sheridan, analyst with McDonald & Co. Mr. Sheridan, who had been expecting quarter profit of about $1.25 a share, says he is reducing his estimate for the year to the area of $5.70 a share, from his previous estimate of $6.10. 

Eli Lustgarten of PaineWebber Inc., who a couple of weeks ago reduced his 1989 estimate to $5.70 a share because of the weakening truck market, says he will make another cut to about $5.50 a share in light of the third-quarter report.
He said Eaton's quarter profit margin on controls was lower than he anticipated. 

Eaton said sales of truck axles, transmissions and other parts fell 7.2% to $295 million.
Sales of parts for cars and construction vehicles rose.
Eaton doesn't provide profit figures separately for each category, but operating profit for vehicle parts as a group fell 26% to $51 million on an about 1% drop in sales to $488 million. 

Mr. Hardis said truck-fleet operators appear to be cautious about buying new trucks until they see how the economy behaves.
The truck sales slowdown reflects the general slowing in sales of consumer goods, he said, and the latest reports show a slight improvement rather than any indication of a downward spiral. 

Operating profit from electrical and electronics controls, Eaton's other major business group, fell 11% to $32 million, despite a 7.7% increase in sales to $376 million.
The company attributed the decline to weakness in the commercial-switch market in North America and in the European appliance-controls market. 

For the nine months, net -- including profit from discontinued operations both years and in 1988 an extraordinary charge of $17.7 million related to settlement of a lawsuit -- was $170.6 million, or $4.54 a share, up 5.8% from $161.3 million, or $4.32 a share, a year ago.
Eaton earned from continuing operations $165.1 million, or $4.40 a share, down 7% from $177.5 million, or $4.76 a share, a year earlier. 

Nine-month sales were $2.79 billion, up 8.2% from $2.58 billion a year earlier. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Eaton closed at $57.50 a share, down $2.50.
