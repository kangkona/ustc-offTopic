France's industrial production index for July and August rose 1% from June and was up 4.6% from a year ago, according to seasonally adjusted data from the National Statistics Institute. 

The state agency, which usually publishes the data on monthly basis, but traditionally combines the index for the two summer-holiday months, said the advance was led by output of consumer goods, which rose 3.5% from June and was up 7.2% from a year earlier. 

Semifinished goods turned in a strong showing, with a monthly rise of 2% and a year-on-year advance of 3%.
Food production was ahead 1.7% from June and 5.3% from a year earlier.
Output in the capital-goods sector was ahead 0.9% on a monthly basis and 2.7% year on year. 

These gains were partly offset by output of cars and other consumer durables, which eased 3.9% from June's high level.
The sector was still 8.8% above its output levels from a year earlier, however.
