The stock market went on a dizzying ride as UAL, parent of United Airlines, once again led shares into a breathtaking decline and then an afternoon comeback. 

At the end of it all, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 3.69 to 2659.22.
At one point yesterday morning, the Dow was down 80.53 points.
New York Stock Exchange volume was 237,960,000 shares.
Declining issues swamped advancers, 1,222 to 382. 

Yesterday's sell-off and rebound was a powerful reminder that 11 days after the 190-point plunge on Friday the 13th, the stock market still has a bad case of nerves.
Takeover stock speculation and futures-related program trading drove the industrial average through wide ranges.
And there is more volatility to come. 

"October 13th left us with a cut and exposed nerve," said Jack Solomon, technical analyst for Bear Stearns. "People are fearful and sensitive.
Everybody's finger is one inch closer to the button.
I have never had as many calls as I had this morning.
Volatility is here to stay." 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged about 80 points in slightly more than one hour after the opening bell. 

For many, it began to look like a replay of Oct. 13.
As stocks and stock-index futures fell, a trading limit was hit in the S&P 500 stock futures pit.
Under a post-1987 crash reform, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange wouldn't permit the December S&P futures to fall further than 12 points for a half hour.
That caused a brief period of panic selling of stocks on the Big Board.
But at a critical moment, stock-index arbitrage traders showed their power and control.
They scooped up hundreds of S&P futures when the market needed it most. 

At about 10:40 a.m. EDT, several big buy orders hit the S&P pit simultaneously, lifting the futures up out of the trading limit and eventually into ranges that caused computer-driven program buying of stocks. 

"It is very clear that those buy orders came from people who wanted their franchise protected," said one Chicago-based futures trader. "These guys wanted to do something to show how powerful they are." 

Traders said Goldman Sachs, Shearson Lehman Hutton and Salomon Brothers were the main force behind the futures buying at the pivotal moment.
Shearson Lehman Hutton declined to comment.
Officials at Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers were unavailable for comment. 

As in the Oct. 13 massacre, yesterday morning's drop was triggered by bad news for speculators in UAL.
A UAL statement after the market closed Monday indicated that the airline's board wanted to keep the company independent, effectively crushing hopes of an immediate buy-out.
Five minutes before the Big Board opened, a preliminary price was flashed for UAL -- somewhere between 135 and 155, a loss of as much as $43 a share from Monday's close. 

UAL finally opened for trading at 10:08 a.m. at 150, down $28.
Floor traders said there was a huge crowd around the Big Board specialist's post where UAL trades. "There was a seething mass of people," said one floor trader. "Then there was a big liquidation of stock" across the board, he added. 

Takeover speculators -- who have already taken a record loss estimated at more than $700 million on UAL -- started selling other stocks as well as S&P futures in an attempt to hedge against a further UAL blood bath.
Shortly after the UAL opening, program traders started selling stocks in the Major Market Index and S&P 500 index.
The 20-stock MMI mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 

By 10:30 a.m. the Dow was down 62.70.
All 20-stocks in the MMI except Exxon, General Motors and Sears were down $1 to $2. 

At 10:33, when the S&P 500 December futures contract crunched to a 12-point loss under the force of sell programs, S&P futures trading was halted and program trades on the Big Board were routed into a special computer that scans for order imbalances.
Under the rules adopted by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the futures contract cannot drop below the limit, but buyers can purchase futures.
At this point, the Dow industrials were down 75.41 points and falling. 

The trading halt in the S&P 500 futures exacerbated selling and confusion, many traders maintain.
But as the fright began to spread through the S&P pit, the big brokerage firms came in and bought futures aggressively. 

"It was whooosh]" said one futures trader.
In five minutes, the Dow industrials climbed almost 30 points.
The big futures buying triggered stock-index buy programs that eventually trimmed the Dow's loss to 31 points by 11 a.m. 

Traders said the futures buying was finely calculated by program traders.
These firms sold stock into the big morning decline, but seeing the velocity of the market's drop, held back on their offsetting purchases of futures until the S&P futures hit the trading limit.
Then they completed the other side of the trade by buying futures, which abruptly halted the stock market's decline as traders began to buy stocks. 

From then on, the Dow industrials held at a loss of 40 to 50 points.
Then, in late-afternoon trading, hundred-thousand-share buy orders for UAL hit the market, including a 200,000-share order through Bear Stearns that seemed to spark UAL's late price surge.
Almost simultaneously, PaineWebber began a very visible buy program for dozens of stocks.
The combined buying rallied the Dow into a small gain, before closing at a slight loss. 

Some institutional traders loved the wild ride. "This is fun," asserted Susan Del Signore, head equity trader at Travelers Investment Management Co.
She said she used the market's wild swings to buy shares cheaply on the sell-off.
On the comeback, Ms. Del Signore unloaded shares she has been aiming to get rid of. 

But traders who risk money handling big blocks of stock were shaken. "This market is eating away my youth," said Chung Lew, head equity trader at Kleinwort Benson North America Inc. "Credibility sounds intangible.
But I think we are losing credibility because when the market does this, it doesn't present itself as a rational investment.
But if you overlook all this, it is a beautiful market for investment still." 

Traders attributed rallies in a number of stocks to a Japanese buy program that PaineWebber carried out as part of a shift in portfolio strategy, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. 

Dow Jones climbed 5 3/4 to 41 on very heavy volume of 786,100 shares.
Analysts said a big Japanese buy order was behind the rise.
A Dow Jones spokesman said there were no corporate developments that would account for the activity.
Other issues said to be included in the buy program were Procter & Gamble, which rose 2 7/8 to 133 1/2; Atlantic Richfield, which gained 2 to 103 3/4, and Rockwell International, which jumped 2 3/4 to 27 1/8.
PaineWebber declined to comment. 

UAL finished at 170, off 8 3/8.
Other airline stocks fell in response to the UAL board's decision to remain independent for now, including USAir Group, which separately reported a third-quarter loss of $1.86 a share compared with a year-ago profit.
USAir fell 2 1/2 to 40. 

AMR, the parent of American Airlines, fell 1 3/4 to 68 7/8 on 2.3 million shares; Delta Air Lines lost 1 1/2 to 66, Southwest Airlines slid 3/4 to 24 1/4 and Midway Airlines dropped 1/4 to 14 7/8.
Texas Air, which owns Continental and Eastern airlines, lost 3/8 to 13 1/8 on the American Stock Exchange. 

Metals stocks also were especially weak, as concerns about the earnings outlook for cyclical companies weighed on the group.
Aluminum Co. of America dropped 1 1/2 to 70 1/4, Phelps Dodge fell 4 to 59 7/8, Asarco lost 1 3/8 to 31 3/4, Reynolds Metals slid 1 3/8 to 50 3/8, Amax dropped 1 1/8 to 21 5/8 and Cyprus Minerals skidded 2 to 26 3/4.
Alcan Aluminium was an exception, as it gained 1 3/8 to 23 on two million shares. 

Goodyear Tire & Rubber tumbled 2 7/8 to 43 7/8.
Its third-quarter earnings were higher than a year ago, but fell short of expectations.
Other stocks in the Dow industrials that failed to benefit from the market's rebound included United Technologies, which dropped 1 to 53 5/8, and Bethle hem Steel, which fell 1 to 16 7/8. 

BankAmerica dropped 1 1/4 to 29 1/2 on 2.3 million shares amid rumors that the earthquake last week in the San Francisco area had caused structural damage to its headquarters building.
The company denied the rumors and noted that it doesn't own the building. 

Stocks of California-based thrifts also were hard hit.
Great Western Financial lost 1 1/8 to 20 1/2 on 1.6 million shares, Golden West Financial dropped 1 1/4 to 28 1/2 and H.F. Ahmanson dipped 5/8 to 21 1/4.

Golden Valley Microwave Foods skidded 3 5/8 to 31 3/4 after warning that its fourth-quarter results could be hurt by "some fairly large international marketing expenses." 

Dividend-related trading swelled volume in two issues: Security Pacific, which fell 7/8 to 44 1/2 and led the Big Board's most actives list on composite volume of 14.8 million shares, and Nipsco Industries, which lost 3/8 to 17 3/8 on 4.4 million shares.
Both stocks have dividend yields of about 5% and will go ex-dividend Wednesday. 

Kellogg surged 4 1/4 to 75.
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette placed the stock on its list of recommended issues.
