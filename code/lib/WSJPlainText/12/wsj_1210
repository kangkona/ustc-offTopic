Fireman's Fund Corp. said third-quarter net income plunged 85% to $7.2 million from last year's $49.1 million, or 99 cents a share, because of ravages of Hurricane Hugo and increased reserves for legal expenses. 

Payout of preferred dividends resulted in a net loss of five cents a share in the most recent quarter.
Revenue edged up 3.4% to $904 million from $874 million in last year's third quarter. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Fireman's closed at $35.50 a share, down 50 cents. 

Impact of the Oct. 17 San Francisco earthquake, which will be recorded in the fourth quarter, isn't expected to exceed $50 million after taxes, the company added. 

For the nine months, the insurance company said net fell 46% to $88.8 million, or $1.54 a share, from $164 million, or $3.16 a share, the previous year.
Revenue slid 7% to $2.6 billion from $2.8 billion a year earlier. 

Fireman's Fund property-liability subsidiaries reported a 120.7% combined underwriting ratio for the nine months, up from 108.4% for the year-ago period. 

Hurricane Hugo accounted for about $36 million in pretax third-quarter losses, net of reinsurance recoveries. 

The company said there was an additional increase in loss and loss-expense reserves of $71 million reflecting "higher than expected" development in claims legal expenses from to prior periods. 

For the third quarter, net premiums were $742 million, up 9.6% from $677 million in last year's quarter, because of the expiration of the National Indemnity quota share reinsurance agreement. 

Net premiums written through Sept. 30 fell 5% to $2.1 billion from $2.2 billion a year ago, because of the writing of fewer policies at flat prices, the company said. 

Third-quarter and nine-month results don't include any provision for premium returns that could be ordered by the California Department of Insurance under Proposition 103.
Fireman's Fund said it has applied for an exemption from these rate rollbacks, and plans to defend its filing in hearings before the department.
