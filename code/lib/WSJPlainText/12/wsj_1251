Fatalities on rural interstates rose 33% between 1986 and last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a report on the impact of the 65 miles-per-hour speed limit on those roads. 

The report to Congress said that fatalities rose 18% in 1987 and 13% in 1988 on rural interstates.
The 1987 highway bill permitted states to raise the speed limit to 65 mph from 55 mph on interstate roads, which are defined as highways that pass through areas with fewer than 50,000 people.
Since 1987, 40 states have increased the speed limit on rural interstates. 

"About one-third of the fatality increase is attributed to greater travel, and about two-thirds is attributed to other factors {primarily to greater speed}," according to NHTSA. 

The report showed that deaths on urban interstate highways rose 7% between 1986 and last year, while fatalities on non-interstate roads were about the same in 1988 as in 1986. 

In states that raised the speed limit on rural interstates, the fatality rate rose about 18% to 1.7 deaths per 100 million miles traveled between 1986 and 1988.
In contrast, the fatality rate in the states that retained the 55 mph limit was 0.9 last year, the same as in 1986.
