Traders called the first day of trading in a new 10-year government of Canada bond futures contract a solid success with an estimated 2,746 contracts, or a face amount of 274.6 million Canadian dollars (US$231.5 million), changing hands. 

"It was fantastic," said Michel Sevigny, director of trading for McNeil Mantha Inc., Montreal.
Mr. Sevigny also traded for his own account Friday in the Montreal Exchange's new futures pit.
He said the market functioned well, with "good volatility and good volume." 

But he and other traders warned the test for the contract will come in the next month. "If we can keep that volume for a week or two, then we'll have a solid base," Mr. Sevigny said. 

The C$100,000 contract is based on a 10-year government of Canada bond with a 9% coupon.
A futures contract obligates the holder to buy or sell a security or commodity at a given price within a specified period.
The new Montreal Exchange contract is the only existing Canada bond futures contract.
