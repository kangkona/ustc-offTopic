South Korean businesses substantially increased their overseas investments during 1989 in efforts to find new export markets, the Bank of Korea said. 

The bank said overseas investment for the first eight months of this year reached $453.8 million invested in 235 projects.
That compared with $180.3 million invested in 149 projects during the whole of 1988, the bank said. 

Among the various projects, Southeast Asia, mainly Indonesia and Thailand, attracted 120 projects worth $148.5 million, the bank said. 

South Korean firms invested $158.4 million in 49 projects in North America and $62.8 million in 25 projects in Latin America, it said. 

Europe attracted 16 investment projects worth $19.4 million, the bank said. 

The government, which must approve overseas investment, has relaxed its regulations, allowing greater overseas investment, the bank noted. 

South Korean businesses increased overseas investments seeking new markets to help offset export losses caused by the rising value of the South Korean won, the bank said.
Most of the investments involved manufacturing and trading companies, it said.
