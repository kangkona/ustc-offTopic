I was very concerned to see a table entitled "The World-Wide Tax Revolution" showing an inaccurate figure for the top rate of personal income tax in the U.K. (editorial page, Aug. 29). 

The past five years have seen a dramatic reduction in U.K. tax rates.
The main rate of corporate tax has been reduced to 35%, which is one of the lowest rates in the industrialized world.
The rate is even lower for small companies with taxable profits of up to #750,000.
There also has been a significant reduction in personal tax rates in this period.
The basic personal tax rate is 25% with a single higher rate of only 40%.
This top rate of 40% is the lowest top rate in the European Community.
