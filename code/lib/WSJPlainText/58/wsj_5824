Sunbelt Nursery Group Inc. said it is offering to purchase shares from stockholders who own fewer than 100. 

The nursery retailer said it will pay $6 a share or the average closing stock price between Sept. 15 and Oct. 30, whichever is higher.
Each shareholder also will receive $15 for selling the stock to the company. 

A Sunbelt spokesman said that about 2,000 to 2,500 of its stockholders own fewer than 100 shares, most of which probably were received when the company was spun off from Pier 1 Imports Inc. in 1985.
The company has about 3.8 million shares outstanding.
