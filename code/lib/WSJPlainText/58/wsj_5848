Consolidated Edison Co. of New York said it would remove all asbestos from steam system manholes by late 1990 following a recent pipe blast here that spewed the cancer-causing substance into the air. 

The utility said it was acting on the recommendation of a team investigating the accident in the Gramercy Park area of Manhattan.
About 1,000 of the 1,700 manholes in the steam system already have been cleared of asbestos since the company stopped using it as an insulator in 1975. 

Con Edison said it usually replaces the asbestos with calcium silicate.
