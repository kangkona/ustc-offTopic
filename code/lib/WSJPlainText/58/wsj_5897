Broken Hill Proprietary Co., an Australian steel, mining and oil company, said its net income rose 12% to 272.6 million Australian dollars (US$211.1 million) for the fiscal first quarter. 

Earnings a share rose 9.2% to 18.9 Australian cents a share from 17.3 Australian cents a share.
Dividend for the quarter ended Aug. 31 was raised to 17.5 Australian cents a share from 15.5 Australian cents a share a year ago. 

Sales and other revenue rose 23% to A$3.42 billion (US$2.65 billion) from A$2.79 billion a year ago. 

BHP directors said the increase in revenue was largely because of higher steel sales and the inclusion of sales by Pacific Resources Inc., a Hawaiian oil refiner that BHP purchased in March. 

Also, a weaker Australian dollar further boosted revenue, they said.
