Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.
A. said it is reorganizing its international commodity trading operations in Paris, two months after being forced to liquidate multimillion dollar soybean futures positions at a loss on the Chicago Board of Trade. 

The Italian conglomerate said it named Romano Venturi, managing director of the company's Ferruzzi Italia unit, head of the new trading operations.
Ferruzzi also said that as part of the restructuring the trading unit would work more closely with Ferruzzi's agricultural businesses, including Central Soya, a U.S. soybean processor it purchased in 1987. 

Ferruzzi confirmed that three officers of Ferruzzi France have announced their resignations as a result of the reorganizations.
The three, as previously reported, are Rolland Gagliardini and Frank Gleeson, the former head of trading and the top trader in Paris, respectively, and Maurice Elbaz, another trader. 

Ferruzzi was at the center of an international trading controversy in July when it lost a showdown with the Board of Trade and was forced to sell off huge futures holdings that called for the delivery of 23 million bushels of soybeans.
Ferruzzi has denied that its traders were trying to manipulate soybean futures and cash prices upward by holding such a large futures position.
