France and other European Community countries are hoping for a breakthrough today on the controversial issue of widening EC Commission powers over corporate mergers. 

Officials said that although a final accord may not come before year end, the 12 EC governments have reached broad agreement on the size of the mergers that would be subject to approval.
Despite reservations on some parts of the plan, a compromise could be reached at today's Council of Ministers meeting, a commission spokesman said. 

The plan, which was first put forth more than 15 years ago, would give the commission power to review and block large transborder mergers.
Currently, the commission can intervene only after the merger has taken place and if a complaint is filed under the Treaty of Rome's antitrust rules. 

Under the compromise pushed by France and the commission, the commission would review mergers of companies with global combined revenue of more than five billion European currency units ($5.27 billion).
That threshold would be reduced to two billion ECUs by the end of 1992.
If two-thirds of the combined revenue is in a single EC country, the country would retain its regulatory powers over the merger, a commission spokesman said. 

The commission would give an initial opinion within one month and issue a definitive decision within two months.
