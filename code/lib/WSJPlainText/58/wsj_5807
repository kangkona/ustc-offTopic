An Arizona Corporation Commission hearing officer issued a scathing recommendation in which he suggested that the commission cut Tucson Electric Power Co. 's request for a rate increase to $57 million from $80.3 million and that the company's request for a 9% fuel surcharge be denied. 

The commission can accept, deny or amend the recommendations. 

Assistant Chief Hearing Officer Jerry Rudibaugh also recommended that a Tucson Electric management audit be conducted, saying that "one theme prevalent throughout the recent history of TEP has been its emphasis on shareholder/management compensation, and disregard for its customers and this regulatory commission." He added that the utility "stretched the regulatory limits as far as possible.
As a result, the company was reluctant to come before the commission for a rate increase until financially it could no longer afford to wait." 

A Tucson Electric spokesman noted that the company has 10 days to respond to the commission, and wouldn't comment further. 

Edward Tirello, a utility analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said that despite the critical language, the officer's recommendation is "not all that bad.
On a relative basis it could have been worse." He noted that although the utility had requested a 22% rate boost, it was bracing itself for only a 9% to 10% increase.
The officer's recommendation would amount to nearly a 12% increase. 

Under the recommendation, the average residential electric bill would increase $5.35 a month.
