Boeing Co. is in negotiations with the Turkish government to build between 50 and 100 Chinook helicopters in that country, the Puget Sound (Wash.) Business Journal reported. 

The newest version of the Chinook, the CH-47D, costs about $15 million each, giving the total deal a potential value of $750 million or more.
The U.S. Army has purchased 472 of the twin-rotor helicopters, or about half the world fleet, during the past two decades.
But as the cost of the Chinook has risen, the Army has been refurbishing its existing helicopters rather than purchasing new ones, and the aerospace firm has had to look elsewhere for buyers. 

The talks were disclosed by Turkish Ambassador Nuzhet Kandemir, who was in Seattle earlier this month for a trade conference.
Burl Zorn, Boeing Helicopters' area-sales director for the Middle East, also confirmed that the Turkish government had inquired about building the helicopters under some form of co-production agreement, the newspaper said.
Boeing already has an agreement under which F-16 fighter planes are being built in Turkey. 

A version of the Chinook is being built in Japan under a co-production agreement, but it is limited to the Japanese market.
However, Mr. Kandemir said he hopes any agreement with Boeing would allow Turkey to eventually export Chinooks built there, the newspaper said.
