Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney has ordered the Pentagon to develop plans to strengthen the U.S. military presence in the Caribbean Sea and along the nation's southern border to curb cocaine smuggling. 

Noting that Congress and President Bush have given his department the lead role in interdicting illegal drug shipments, Mr. Cheney told his top commanders to develop plans by Oct. 15 to carry out the new missions. 

Mr. Cheney also asked the military to accelerate training and other assistance to military and police forces in Latin America. 

Mr. Cheney said he hoped the moves would "immediately complicate the challenge of getting illegal drugs into America -- increasing the cost and the risk of drug smuggling." 

At a Pentagon briefing, Mr. Cheney said the plans will be carried out under President Bush's guideline that no U.S. troops will accompany Latin American forces on military operations.
U.S. troops, he said, will be restricted to training and technical aid, such as improving communications. 

While there have been reports that some U.S. military officials were reluctant to take on the anti-drug mission, Mr. Cheney said, "I haven't found that to be the case." 

The cost of the new Pentagon effort, he said, won't be determined until the plans are analyzed and approved.
