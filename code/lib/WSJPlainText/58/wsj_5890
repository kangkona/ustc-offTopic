The Bush administration is taking flak over its decision to hold down the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. this coming year for budgetary reasons. "I resent the implication," Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger said Friday, "that we have some heartless, niggardly, conservative approach to this problem.
But there are limits on the numbers we can take." If the problem is simply the estimated $7,000 per refugee processing costs, why not loan the refugees the money to get across the first hump?
Considering how many deadbeats the U.S. loans money to already, refugees seeking freedom and work surely would be the one group that would pay America back quickly and cheerfully.
