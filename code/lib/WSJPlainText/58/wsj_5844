Amcor Ltd., a paper and packaging concern, said it is buying three Australian corrugated cardboard box plants from Smorgon Consolidated Industries, a closely held concern. 

The price wasn't disclosed. 

Garry Ringwood, general manager of Amcor's APM Packaging division, said the three new plants will lift Amcor's production to about 315,000 metric tons of corrugated cardboard a year from around 250,000 currently. 

Two of the plants are in Melbourne and the other is in Sydney.
