Rockwell International Corp. said its Collins Defense Communications unit will cut back production operations at its facility here over the next six to nine months as contracts are completed or consolidated into other locations. 

The production operations, which currently employ 500 people, will be cut back to 200 employees and restructured to provide systems integration and engineering development support to the unit's other operations in Richardson.
Collins Defense employs more than 1,900 persons at its command and control systems programs facility here.
