Italy's foreign trade balance showed a surplus of 1.704 trillion lire ($1.2 billion) in July, up from a surplus of 1.050 trillion lire a year earlier, Istat said. 

The state statistical office said the July surplus compared with a deficit of 941 billion lire in June. 

While the trade balance for July improved, the trade account for the year's first seven months still deteriorated sharply.
Istat said the trade deficit for the first seven months of 1989 widened to 12.464 trillion lire from 7.403 trillion lire a year ago. 

Istat said the trade statistics are provisional and aren't seasonally adjusted.
