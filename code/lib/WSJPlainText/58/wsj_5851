First Union Real Estate Investments said it would post a third-quarter gain of $8.9 million, or 50 cents a share, on the sale of an Atlanta office building. 

The trust earned $5.4 million, or 29 cents a share, in the third quarter last year. 

First Union said proceeds from the sale will be used to improve the company's borrowing position by reducing outstanding short-term debt.
