Air France and Lufthansa of West Germany unveiled a wide-ranging cooperation accord apparently aimed at reinforcing their mutual market positions ahead of Western European airline deregulation. 

In announcing the pact, which they termed a "commercial agreement," the two carriers said they will begin talks with the Spanish state airline Iberia about reaching a similar accord. 

In Brussels, a spokesman for the European Community Commission said the commission "certainly will be looking for notification" of the terms of the agreement "so we'll know for sure whether it raises questions" in the field of EC antitrust law. 

Air France and Lufthansa announced they will look for ways to work together in cargo, pilot training, aircraft acquisitions, marketing, catering and duty-free sales.
Sharing of traffic rights on some joint flights wasn't ruled out, but cross-shareholdings were.
The carriers stressed that the accord "doesn't exclude any alliances with other airlines in the world," and they claimed it will result in benefits for consumers. 

Bernard Attali, Air France chairman, dismissed any potential problems with EC competition law. "It's our right to work with a privileged partner," he said.
Similarly, Lufthansa Chairman Heinz Ruhnau said he doesn't foresee any need to seek the blessing of the EC for such joint activities.
