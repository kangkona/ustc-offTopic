The torrid Mojave sun must have addled Eileen White Read on her visit to the new Patton museum ("The Gallery: Celebrating the Frontier Fable," Leisure & Arts, Aug. 31).
Field Marshal Erwin Rommel was the "Desert Fox," not "Hitler's Desert Rat." Also, Patton's two pistols, a Colt .45 automatic and a .357 Magnum Colt Python revolver, had grips made of ivory, not pearl as described by Ms. Read.
According to Patton, "Only a pimp in a two-bit New Orleans cathouse would carry a pearl-handled pistol."

Patton did not "vanquish" anyone in Africa: The British Eighth Army did it, with only some assistance from American forces. "Desert Rats" refers to the British Eighth Army soldiers, not to the German Afrika Corps.
