Norwest Corp. agreed to acquire First Interstate Corp. of Wisconsin for about $215 million in common stock. 

Under the agreement, the regional bank holding company said, First Interstate holders will receive for each of their common shares, Norwest common valued at $25.50.
The exchange ratio may vary from 1.103 to 1.166 of Norwest shares for each First Interstate share, depending on the value of Norwest shares during a specified period. 

In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, First Interstate of Wisconsin shares jumped $5.50 to close at $23 a share, while Norwest shares rose 25 cents to $22.50 each in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

A Norwest spokesman said the company expects to issue about 9.6 million common shares to complete the transaction, although the precise number can't yet be determined.
Norwest has about 93 million common shares outstanding. 

First Interstate, based in Kohler, Wis., has assets of $1.7 billion, compared with Norwest's $23 billion in assets.
The Wisconsin bank had 1988 earnings of $13.2 million, or $1.55 a share. 

Norwest said the merger, which will be carried out on a "pooling-of-interest" basis, is expected to have a "very minimal" dilution in per-share earnings for 1990 and will be "anti-dilutive" by 1991, the company said. 

The transaction, which the companies expect to close in early 1990, is subject to, among other things, the approval of First Interstate shareholders.
Norwest will need the approval of its shareholders to issue additional common shares, and regulators must approve the merger. 

Norwest, a large bank holding company in the Midwest, already owns a bank in La Crosse, Wis., as well as several consumer finance and mortgage offices in the state.
