NRM Energy Co. L.P., buffeted by depressed gas prices, announced payment on some of its preferred units but suspended distribution on others. 

Distribution on the oil and gas company's $2.60 senior cumulative convertible preferred depositary units will be payable Nov. 15 to unit holders of record Sept. 29, at the rate of 65 cents per unit.
But distribution has been suspended on NRM's $2 convertible acquisition preferred units, which are cumulative and bear interest at one percentage point above the prime rate. 

NRM earlier reported a deterioration in financial results.
For the first six months of 1989, it posted a loss of $36.7 million, widened from a year-earlier loss of $11.4 million.
Revenue for the first half fell to $34.6 million from $42.2 million. 

In addition, an NRM spokeswoman said the company is "in the throes of determining a restructuring" and the suspension is part of its strategy to become a publicly traded corporation. 

Proxy materials will be mailed to unit holders in October, she added, with restructuring to be completed by year end.
