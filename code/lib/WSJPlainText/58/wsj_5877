A federal appeals court in New Orleans threw out a federal natural-gas-pricing regulation, a move that could lead to refunds of as much as $100 million for gas customers nationwide. 

Under the 1986 regulation, Order 451, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission allowed producers to bring contracts governing certain low-priced gas to pipelines for renegotiation at a higher price.
The gas was called shut-in gas because its price was so low that the producers weren't making it available under the contracts. 

In a limited number of cases, the pipelines could bring certain high-priced contracts to the negotiations with the aim of lowering the price.
If the negotiations fell through, the producers could abandon the contracts.
The commission said 1,600 contracts were renegotiated under the order. 

The appeals court ruled that Order 451 exceeded FERC's authority.
The ruling by a three-judge panel has no dissenting opinion, although one judge reserved the right to file a concurring or dissenting opinion. 

Martha Hesse, chairwoman of the commission, said she would probably recommend that the commission appeal the case to the Supreme Court.
Private groups estimated that if the high court upholds the ruling, the commission will probably require producers to return the higher prices to consumers through refunds totaling up to $100 million. 

The ruling, written by Judge Sam Johnson, came in a case brought by Mobil Oil Exploration & Producing Southeast Inc., a unit of Mobil Corp., and various other groups, including the American Gas Association and the Citizen/Labor Energy Coalition.
Edwin Rothschild, assistant director of the coalition, called the ruling "a great victory for consumers." 

Michael Baly, executive vice president of the American Gas Association, said the group is "pleased" that the court agreed with its argument "that Congress didn't give FERC the authority to raise old gas prices." 

Mobil spokesmen couldn't be reached for comment.
