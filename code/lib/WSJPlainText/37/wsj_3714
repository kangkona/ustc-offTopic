Speculation that British Aerospace PLC is considering a takeover of Britain's troubled Ferranti International Signal PLC helped brake a fall in the electronics company's shares. 

Ferranti resumed trading yesterday on London's Stock Exchange, after a three-week trading suspension and company disclosures of alleged accounting fraud at a U.S. unit. 

Ferranti shares ended at 55 pence (89 cents) each -- a less-than-expected decline of 25% from the pre-suspension price.
Volume was 115 million shares, more than 15 times normal levels. 

On Friday, Ferranti said it expects to write off assets of #185 million ($298.5 million) after tax because of what it called "serious fraud" at a U.S. division.
A unit of International Signal & Control PLC, of Lancaster, Pa., with which Ferranti merged last year, reported #215 million in non-existent contracts, Ferranti said. 

British Aerospace was widely rumored as a buyer of Ferranti shares yesterday in anticipation of a bid, but a spokeswoman for the aviation concern declined to comment.
A spokesman for London-based Hoare Govett Ltd. denied a market rumor that it bought 20 million Ferranti shares, or a 2.6% stake, for British Aerospace. 

A Ferranti spokesman declined to comment on whether his company is discussing a possible partnership or merger with British Aerospace.
