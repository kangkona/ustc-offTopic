An effort to write the fairness doctrine into federal law passed a key test as the House voted to keep the provision in a pending deficit-reduction measure. 

The 261-162 vote ensures that the fairness doctrine will remain part of the House bill, which is expected to be passed as soon as tomorrow.
But there is growing debate in the Senate on whether to include the provision in its version of the legislation. 

The Federal Communications Commission, which created the doctrine 40 years ago, abolished it in 1987.
Another attempt to restore the doctrine by statute was vetoed by President Reagan. 

The doctrine required broadcasters who aired controversial news and public affairs programs to provide time for opposing viewpoints.
The FCC argued that it didn't pass constitutional muster and had a chilling effect on material broadcasters were willing to use.
