A bankruptcy judge approved Eastern Airlines' request to withdraw $75 million held in escrow, but the airline's creditors committee imposed some conditions on the withdrawal. 

The Texas Air unit has said it needs the cash to pay for continuing operations as it beefs up service and pays for fourth-quarter expenses.
But its creditors committee agreed to the withdrawal only after Eastern pledged to deposit other cash it may receive into an escrow account. 

Eastern stands to gain $30 million from a public offering by sister carrier Continental Airlines.
And it has asked to replace $20 million of collateral on directors' and officers' liability with asset security.
If Eastern receives those funds, the money would have to be deposited in the escrow account.
