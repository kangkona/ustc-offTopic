Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. estimates claims from Hurricane Hugo, which ripped through the Carolinas nearly two weeks ago, will result in a pretax charge of $35 million to $40 million against third-quarter earnings. 

In the year-earlier third quarter the company earned $49 million, or $1.02 a share. 

The company said the charge would be net of reinsurance recoveries.
