Canada's largest regional airline broke an agreement with one of the country's dominant carriers and outlined an aggressive plan to strike out on its own. 

Inter-Canadian Airlines unilaterally terminated an agreement with its commercial partner and minority holder, Canadian Airlines International Ltd., a unit of PWA Corp., Calgary.
The agreement, which barred Inter-Canadian from flying between Montreal and Toronto, Canada's busiest air route, still had 18 years left to run. 

Montreal-based Inter-Canadian said it will change its name to Intair and plans to operate 40 flights daily by the end of the month on the Montreal-Toronto route.
Inter-Canadian said it also intends to seek routes to U.S. destinations and to expand service in Ontario.
The airline said it currently operates about 1,100 flights a week and will maintain service to all existing destinations. 

Michel Leblanc, president and chief executive officer, said the airline will seek a major financial institution or a major U.S. or European airline as a minority partner to replace PWA. 

Mr. Leblanc said Inter-Canadian's flights will be listed in AMR Corp. 's Sabre computer reservation system but said this doesn't necessarily indicate AMR's American Airlines unit is Inter-Canadian's most likely new partner.
American Airlines officials have said in the past that they're interested in the Canadian market.
An American Airlines spokeswoman declined to comment. 

Privately held Inter-Canadian said its three main holders are negotiating with PWA to acquire its 31% stake in the regional airline. 

PWA was surprised by Inter-Canadian's announcement.
Rhys Eaton, president and chief executive officer, said PWA hasn't yet agreed to terminate the commercial agreement nor to sell its stake back to Inter-Canadian's owners.
