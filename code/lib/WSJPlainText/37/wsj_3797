French construction group Bouygues S.A. turned its diversification strategy to the food sector by announcing the acquisition of 50.3% of Grands Moulins de Paris S.A. for about one billion French francs ($156.9 million). 

Bouygues said it plans to offer 1,400 francs a share for the remainder of the flour, frozen baked goods and animal foods concern and 950 francs each for its share-purchase warrants.
A Bouygues official estimated that this could cost another one billion francs if all Grands Moulins holders decide to sell. 

The acquisition represents a new direction in a diversification that has taken Bouygues from the building industry into television and offshore oil in recent years.
It also appears to solve problems that arose at Grands Moulins last week when some members of the controlling Vilgrain family said they wanted to sell their holdings.
Trading in its stock was suspended while the other family members sought to put together a new controlling structure.
