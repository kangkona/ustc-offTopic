The Federal Trade Commission says R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. has agreed to settle false advertising charges that it misused a study linking smoking and heart disease. 

The charges stem from a 1985 advertisement in which the company, a unit of New York-based RJR Nabisco Inc., used some of the results of a National Institutes of Health study on smoking and heart disease.
The FTC said Reynolds falsely claimed in its ads that the study showed that smoking isn't as hazardous as the public had been led to believe and that it refuted the theory that smoking causes heart disease. 

The commission also charged that Reynolds failed to disclose in its ad that people who participated in the study who quit smoking had a significantly lower death rate from heart disease than those who continued smoking.
The study was the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial, known as MR FIT, which was funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health. 

Under the proposed settlement, the company agreed to not misrepresent the results of the NIH study in future advertisements.
The commission accepted the agreement by a 3-1 vote, with Chairman Janet Steiger not participating and Commissioner Mary Azcuenaga dissenting. 

Ms. Azcuenaga argued that the consent agreement represents "less relief than the commission ordinarily seeks in a deceptive advertising proceeding and less relief than is justified under the circumstances." 

The Washington, D.C.-based Coalition on Smoking or Health, which asked the FTC to bring the false advertising charges against Reynolds, called the settlement a "major victory." The coalition is made up of the American Cancer Society and the American Heart and Lung Associations. 

In June 1986, when the FTC first issued the complaint, Reynolds defended its ads, calling them public opinion pieces and claiming that the commission's action threatened the right of free speech.
