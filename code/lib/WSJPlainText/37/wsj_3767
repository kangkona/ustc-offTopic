The Federal Trade Commission said that Dr Pepper/Seven Up Cos. signed a consent agreement settling charges related to Dr Pepper's 1984 sale of bottling assets in San Antonio. 

Dr Pepper sold its Dr Pepper and Canada Dry franchises, delivery trucks, vending machines and a warehouse in San Antonio for $14.5 million to Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of the Southwest.
The FTC charged in a 1988 complaint that the sale reduced competition in the 10-county area. 

An FTC complaint againt Coca-Cola Bottling still is pending. 

Under the agreement, Dr Pepper agreed that it wouldn't interfere with any FTC action against Coca-Cola Bottling, including that calling for Coca-Cola Bottling to sell assets or cease and desist from bottling or distributing products. 

Dr Pepper said it didn't have any comment.
