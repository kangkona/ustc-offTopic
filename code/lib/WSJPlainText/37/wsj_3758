Humana Inc., Louisville, Ky., expects to report net income for the year ended Aug. 31 of about $2.55 a share, compared with $2.30 a share, or $227.1 million, in fiscal 1988, David A. Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, told investment analysts in Louisville. 

The health care company will report results for fiscal 1989 in two weeks, the company said.
Mr. Jones made no estimate of revenue. 

Humana's group health division, which had a pretax operating loss of $37 million in 1988, completed fiscal 1989 with a profit and had its best results of the year in the fourth quarter, Mr. Jones said.
