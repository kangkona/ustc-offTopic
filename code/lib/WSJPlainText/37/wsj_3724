Dallas, Atlanta and Kansas City, Mo., are the best metropolitan areas in America for U.S. businesses, according to rankings in a Fortune magazine survey. 

The business biweekly said it ranked the top 10 of the nation's largest metropolitan areas based on such factors as labor force, cost of doing business, economic base, infrastructure and quality of life. 

Dallas-Fort Worth emerged on top based on its 28% commercial real estate vacancy rate, large pool of "talented workers," surging population and active night life. 

"The so-called Metroplex, embracing the suburbs and the area between the cities, is today's dream location for business, largely because of surplus office and factory space in the wake of the oil bust," Fortune said. 

Fortune said No. 2 Atlanta rated highly because of its appearance, low salaries and other business costs, and because it has available land for expansion.
Drawbacks included a high cost of living and high crime rate. 

Kansas City scored for its fountains, museums, Frank Lloyd Wright houses and midtown Country Club Plaza shopping area, as well as good center city housing and an ample supply of technical and professional labor. 

The rest of Fortune's top 10: Los Angeles, Baltimore, New York, California's Bay Area, Pittsburgh, Portland, Ore., and Minneapolis-St.
