Millipore Corp. said William L. Shippey relinquished the job of chief operating officer and assumed his previously held post as president of the company's Waters Chromatography division. 

Mr. Shippey, who became chief operating officer three years ago, will remain executive vice president of the company. 

As president of the Waters division, Mr. Shippey, 47 years old, succeeds Chane Graziano, 51.
The company said Mr. Graziano's role at the company is under discussion. 

A spokesman for the analytical and purification products concern said sales at the Waters division have been "less robust than we would have liked." He said the company saw the "need for a seasoned person" in the division again. 

Waters Chromatography contributes about 40% of the company's annual sales.
In 1988 Millipore had sales of $621.9 million. 

John A. Gilmartin, chairman, president and chief executive officer will assume the duties of chief operating officer. 

Messrs.
Shippey and Graziano couldn't be reached to comment.
