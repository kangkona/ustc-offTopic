A federal judge in Baltimore sentenced Charles Chang, a major figure in the generic-drug scandal at the Food and Drug Administration, to one year in prison and fined him $10,000. 

Mr. Chang, a former FDA supervisory chemist, will be put on a work-release program, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Baltimore.
Last May, Mr. Chang pleaded guilty to two counts of interstate and foreign travel to aid racketeering.
One charge involved his accepting a free, round-the-world trip from a drug industry consultant at the direction of an American Therapeutics Inc. executive.
The other involved his accepting furniture and computer equipment valued at almost $8,000 from the same executive.
The Bohemia, N.Y., generic-drug company has denied any wrongdoing. 

Judge John Hargrove also sentenced Mr. Chang to 1,000 hours of community service and three years' probation. 

The FDA, meanwhile, disclosed that Chicago-based Pharmaceutical Basics Inc. has recalled 16 lots of nystatin tablets used to treat yeast infections in the gastrointestinal tract.
The anti-fungal tablets may not be as potent as they should be, the agency said yesterday.
It was the first recall stemming from the FDA's study of the nation's 30 top-selling generic drugs, although there have been recalls resulting from parallel investigations.
