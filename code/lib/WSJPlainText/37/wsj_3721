Standard & Poor's Corp. said the number of corporate dividend increases dropped in September for the fourth consecutive month and attributed the decline to a slowing in corporate profits. 

The rating agency said 81 dividend increases were reported in September, compared with 87 a year ago. 

S&P's Outlook investment-advisory newsletter said analysts have been slashing 1989 earnings estimates because of the slowing economic growth and other "negative developments," such as increases in bank loan-loss reserves. 

"With the economic expansion reaching the ripe old age of seven, the tendency among companies will be to retain cash for possible future adversity," according to the newsletter.
It sees the number of 1989 dividend increases falling slightly below the four-year high of 1,705 set in 1988. 

The newsletter sees a possible silver lining.
The drop-off in dividend increases may reflect the gains in the stock market as companies feel "less obliged to raise dividends when shareholders see the value of their investments growing with higher share prices."
