Esselte AB may propose paying about $40 a share, or about $180 million, for the 22% of Esselte Business Systems Inc. it doesn't already hold. 

A spokesman declined to elaborate on a statement released late yesterday. 

Esselte Business Systems, which is based in Garden City, N.Y., makes office supplies, graphic arts supplies, retail supplies and business equipment.
It has about 20.5 million shares outstanding.
About 16 million of the shares are owned by Esselte AB, a Solna, Sweden, publisher and cable-television operator. 

In the statement, the subsidiary said it is "engaged in preliminary discussions . . that may lead to a proposal," but it can't give any assurance that a transaction will occur "on these or any other terms." The firm appointed two outside directors to discuss the matter with the parent. 

Trading in Esselte Business Systems shares was halted for the news yesterday at $37.875, up 62.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
