Toro Co. said it reached a definitive agreement to acquire Lawn-Boy Inc., the lawn-mower manufacturing unit of Outboard Marine Corp., for $85 million. 

As a result of the purchase, Toro said it expects earnings for the fiscal year ending July 31, 1990, will fall 20% to 25% to between $16.6 million and $17.9 million.
For fiscal 1989, it earned $22.1 million, or $2.10 a share, on sales of $643.5 million. 

The maker of outdoor-maintenance equipment and irrigation equipment said that one-time cost associated with the integration of Lawn-Boy will hurt earnings for fiscal 1990.
But Toro said that beginning in fiscal 1991, it expects profit to improve significantly by nearly doubling its walk power mower volume without adding related support and overhead costs, and by lower interest cost resulting from a significant positive cash flow. 

Outboard Marine sought buyers for Lawn-Boy and its recently sold Cushman turf-care equipment and industrial-vehicle business in order to focus on its core marine-products business. 

Toro said the purchase price will be adjusted based on the net asset value of Lawn-Boy at the time of the closing.
The transaction is subject to certain conditions, including the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act.
