Tokyo stocks closed lower for the third consecutive day, with the 225-stock Nikkei Index pressured by investment trust fund and arbitrage selling. 

In London, shares were sharply higher as Wall Street's strength helped to overshadow the market's immediate concern with a possible U.K. interest rate increase.
Stock prices also rose on most other exchanges in Europe, Asia and the Pacific. 

Active futures-related selling also was set off as futures prices fell to within 50 or 100 points of the spot index, compared with a normal 300-point differential, according to market analysts. 

The Nikkei Index fell 256.60 to 35366.37.
Volume on the first section was estimated at 750 million shares, compared with 769 million Monday.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers 535-438, with 159 issues unchanged.
The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the first section, which gained 1.36 points Monday, was down 14.78, or 0.55%, at 

In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index fell 13.41 points to 35352.96. 

On Tuesday, Hiroyuki Murai, general manager of the stock trading division at Nikko Securities, said concern over the possibility that West Germany's Bundesbank will decide to raise its discount rate at a council meeting tomorrow put a damper on the market, as did uncertainty about U.S. employment data due to be released Friday. 

Mr. Murai said that although the dollar rebounded to pass the 140-yen level in Tokyo trading yesterday, he isn't concerned about the U.S. currency as long as it stays in the range of 135 yen to 145 yen now considered acceptable to the Japanese market. 

Decliners were found among a wide range of issues, including steels and constructions.
NKK lost 17 yen to 733 yen ($5.25) a share, and Kobe Steel fell 15 to 750.
Ohbayashi was down 40 to 1,680, and Shimizu lost 30 to 2,170. 

Many retail issues encountered profittaking after making sharp gains in September on growing speculation about mergers and acquisitions in the sector. 

Some traders also said speculation was discouraged yesterday by a rumor that a big real estate company that had been considering takeovers of department stores and supermarkets was selling a large number of shares. 

Isetan dropped 200 to 4,750, Ito-Yokado lost 80 to 4,820, and Daiei was down 100 to close at 3,100. 

Heavy electric machinery issues were sold.
Hitachi lost 20 to 1,530, and Toshiba slipped 20 to 1,190. 

Other losers included pharmaceutical and textile shares, but two issues attracted investor interest because of strong earning prospects for new products. 

Sankyo this week introduced Mevalotin, a new type of anti-cholesterol agent.
The company says it expects the product to earn 10 billion yen in the first year and 30 billion yen annually later.
Sankyo was up 40 yesterday at 3,250. 

Kuraray gained 40 to 1,710.
The company received attention for developing a new, highly absorbent material for towels and sport shirts. 

In other market-related news, the Tokyo Stock Exchange reported that the balance of margin buying fell 119.5 billion yen last week to 6.87 trillion yen.

London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, the most widely watched market barometer, finished at 2318.6, up 29.4 points and at its session high.
The narrower Financial Times 30-share index ended 22.4 points higher at 1899.3.
Volume was still modest at 553.8 million shares, although brisker than Monday's 403.8 million. 

Dealers said that even though fears of higher U.K. interest rates are still prevalent, the market was underpinned by the pound's firmness resulting from recent central bank support and by a late flurry of buying for technical reasons. 

The market also gained direction from Ferranti International, a U.K. defense contractor suspended from trading the past three weeks at the company's request. 

Ferranti, which accounted for 21% of the market's turnover with 115 million shares traded, fell in price but fared much better than most commentators had expected.
It ended at 55 pence (89 cents) a share, down 19 from its pre-suspension price, but there had been forecasts of a decline of 30 pence or more. 

London analysts have expected a sharp fall since Ferranti disclosed last Friday that it expects a write-off equal to nearly half its net worth because of what it called "serious fraud" at a unit of Lancaster, Pa.-based International Signal & Control, with which Ferranti merged last year. 

Ferranti's return sparked a rush of rumors including a possible takeover by British Aerospace, which closed 8 lower at 625 on 2.9 million shares.
British Aerospace declined to comment on the rumor.
GEC, also a defense and electronics concern, profited from Ferranti's relatively good showing, closing 6 1/2 higher at 235. 

Elsewhere on the takeover front, Jaguar jumped 26 to 599 on expectations that either Ford Motor or General Motors would announce a firm bid for the luxury auto maker. 

Life insurers continued to be bolstered by news Monday of a #1.1 billion hostile bid for Pearl Group by Australian Mutual Provident Society. 

Pearl rose 7 to 646, Legal & General advanced 8 to 371, and London & Manchester gained 8 to 322. 

Racal issues showed strength after brokerage concern County NatWest Woodmac upgraded earnings estimates, particularly citing its cellular telephone operations.
Racal Electronic rose 10 to 237, while Racal Telecom jumped 8 to 373.
British Telecom was 2 1/2 higher at 272 1/2.
Cable & Wireless rose 6 to 568 in what dealers said was a correction of some excessive selling last week over fears of new tension between China and Taiwan. 

The Anglo-French consortium Eurotunnel still suffered from Monday's announcement that costs of the English Channel Tunnel may be at least #2 billion more than was forecast when digging began 21 months ago.
Eurotunnel lost 50 to 600.
