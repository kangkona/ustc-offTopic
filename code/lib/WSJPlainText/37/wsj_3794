Unocal Inc. said it will close and sell an undetermined number of its service stations and commercial distribution facilities in Oregon and Washington as part of a plan to improve its profitability in the Pacific Northwest. 

Within six months, the Los Angeles oil company said it will withdraw completely from eastern Washington and Oregon and will evaluate its operations in the western portions of the two states.
Disposal of those units to be sold will be completed over the next three years as individual leases expire, Unocal said. 

The company operates 136 service stations and commercial distribution facilities in Washington and 97 stations and 36 commercial sites in Oregon.
About 70% of the facilities are on land owned by Unocal.
