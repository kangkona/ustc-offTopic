Stocks hit record highs in an orderly but powerful rally as investors ignored declines in International Business Machines and other technology issues. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average marched to a 40.84-point gain to a new record close of 2754.56.
Broader measures rose to all-time highs as well: Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 3.84 to 354.71, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index advanced 1.94 to 196.84.
Big Board volume was 182,550,000 shares. 

Traders said a round of foreign buying -- both Japanese and European -- pushed the market higher in morning trading.
Big, well-known stocks, the favorites of overseas customers, clearly led the market. 

Philip Morris added 5 3/8 to 172, Procter & Gamble gained 3 1/8 to 124 5/8, and Boeing advanced 3 1/8 to 59 3/4. 

"If the Japanese are in here, who knows where it can go?" said J. David Mills, senior vice president, Boston Co. Advisers.
He said Japanese investors may consider U.S. stocks cheap and a timely buy, given the dollar's rebound in the past two days. 

Money managers, sensing that foreign demand was picking up, flocked to big stocks in afternoon trading, driving the market higher and triggering stock-index arbitrage buy programs.
In this strategy, traders sell the "expensive" futures and buy the "cheaper" underlying stocks to lock in profits. 

But while many of the stocks among the industrial average performed mightily, IBM dropped lower and lower through the session.
IBM tumbled 2 5/8 to 106, only 4 above the low of 102 on Oct. 19, 1987.
Technical analysts stared in amazement as the market defied IBM's slide. 

"It's a little perverse," said Jack Solomon, technical analyst at Bear Stearns. "People took it as encouraging that the market could rise in the face of a terrible sell-off in technology stocks." 

Other technology stocks left behind in the market's rise included Digital Equipment, which fell 2 1/4 to 88 3/4, and Hewlett-Packard, which fell 1 to 48 1/4.
Cray Research skidded 2 1/4 to 38 after disclosing plans to eliminate about 400 jobs in its Wisconsin manufacturing operations. 

Zenith Electronics fell 1 1/8 to 16 5/8 after soaring 3 1/4 Monday on news of an agreement to sell its computer assets for as much as $635 million to France's Cie. des Machines Bull. 

Other strong blue-chip issues included USX, which gained 1 3/8 to 36 1/4 and topped the Big Board's list of most active issues on composite volume of 5.3 million shares.
There were rumors that investor Carl Icahn was raising his 11.4% interest in the company in anticipation of a stock buy-back.
Traders reasoned that USX would conduct the share repurchase with proceeds from recent asset sales.

Primerica added 3/4 to 28 1/2, Federal National Mortgage Association advanced 1 1/4 to 132 1/4 and Marsh & McLennan climbed 2 1/4 to 75 7/8. 

Interest in the financial group extended to selected issues of insurance companies. 

General Re added 1 7/8 to 86 7/8, American International Group rose 3 to 108, Torchmark climbed 1 5/8 to 49 1/2, Lincoln National rose 2 1/8 to 57 and Aon gained 1 1/4 to 35 7/8.

Bank of Boston, which tumbled 2 5/8 to 24 in active trading, became the latest stock to fall victim to an earnings disappointment.
The company said it expects to post a third-quarter loss of about $125 million, reflecting a $370 million addition to its loan-loss reserves. 

But Tambrands rose 1 1/8 to 74 1/8 even though the company estimated that third-quarter earnings from operations would be 15% to 18% lower than a year earlier, which led analysts at Salomon Brothers and Shearson Lehman Hutton to cut their earnings estimates.
The company is rumored to be a takeover target for Centaur Partners. 

Bristol-Myers gained 1 to 53 1/2 on 1.7 million shares and Squibb rose 2 7/8 to 128 1/2 as shareholders of the drug companies approved their merger plans.

Malcolm I. Glazer, a Rochester, N.Y., investor who previously had made unsuccessful attempts to acquire Conrail and Formica, said he and members of his family hold a combined stake of 6.24% and may seek control. 

Outboard Marine, which agreed to sell its Lawn-Boy unit to Toro for $85 million, climbed 1 1/8 to 31 3/8.
Toro dropped 1 3/8 to 22 5/8; the company forecast that the acquisition would contribute to a 20% to 25% decrease in net income for the fiscal year ending next July. 

The Amex Index posted its biggest advance since Aug. 24 by gaining 3.36 to 393.02.
