The Commerce Department issued a preliminary ruling that residential door locks and parts from Taiwan are being "dumped" in the U.S. 

As a result of the finding, U.S. importers of these locks will be required to put up cash deposits or bonds to cover possible penalty duties on these products.
The duties, which would be designed to eliminate the imported locks' alleged unfair price advantages over comparable U.S. products, could range from 25.4% to 60.8% of the importers' costs, the department announced. 

Such duties won't be imposed, however, unless the Commerce Department reaffirms its finding and the International Trade Commission makes a separate determination that the Taiwanese shipments are injuring a U.S. industry.
Dumping is defined as selling in a foreign market at prices below production costs or prices in the home market. 

The department said last year's imports of residential door locks from Taiwan were valued at $43.6 million.
