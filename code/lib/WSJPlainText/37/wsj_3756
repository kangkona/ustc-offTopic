PageAmerica Group Inc. said it signed a letter of intent to buy certain New York paging operations of Nynex Paging Co., a unit of Nynex Corp. 

The companies said a definitive agreement must be worked out and that Federal Communications Commission approval must be obtained.
The companies declined to estimate the transaction's value. 

Charles Many, president of Nynex Mobile Communications Co., said that "becoming a dominant contender in paging would require major acquisitions and a large commitment of resources.
We've decided to devote these resources to other ventures, including international projects like the German digital cellular license." 

PageAmerica owns and operates radio paging businesses in New York and Chicago with a total of more than 70,000 pagers.
