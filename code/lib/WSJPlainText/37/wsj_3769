The British affiliate of Deloitte, Haskins & Sells has dropped out of the merger between Deloitte and Touche Ross & Co., the two big accounting firms said. 

In a statement, the firms said that "a national merger couldn't be achieved in that country {Great Britain}." However, the member firm of Touche Ross International, the world-wide organization of Touche, in the United Kingdom has agreed to become a member of Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu, the world-wide firm of the merged Deloitte and Touche. 

Reasons weren't given for the merger failure in Britain, and top officials of Deloitte and Touche, both of whom are meeting in Paris, couldn't be reached. 

A spokesman for Deloitte in New York said he didn't know whether this affiliate would remain independent or join another accounting firm.
In the statement, Edward A. Kangas, chief executive of Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu, said that completed mergers of Deloitte and Touche in the U.S., Japan, France and the joining of the single Touche firm in Britain comprise 75% of the total international revenues of both Deloitte and Touche.
