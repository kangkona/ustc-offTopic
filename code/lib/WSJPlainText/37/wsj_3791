Computer maker Pyramid Technology Corp. said it agreed to sell computers to American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and to develop a new computer system with the phone company. 

Pyramid said the AT&T Computer Systems unit of AT&T would gain revenue of $30 million from the machines, versions of Pyramid's MIServer computers, over the next year and about $400 million in revenue over the five-year span of the contract. 

The machines, which sell for around $250,000, are so-called servers used in computer rooms to manage huge computer libraries of data or to act as a "hub" for as many as 1,000 computers.
The machines, which use AT&T's Unix operating-system software and employ so-called reduced instruction set computing technology, are used by the Internal Revenue Service, securities houses and other companies that have large data bases. 

The contract is a big win for Pyramid, which had $80 million in revenue in the year ended Sept. 30, 1988.
The company expects revenue of about $108 million to $112 million this year. 

Edward Scott Jr., Pyramid marketing vice president, wouldn't say how much AT&T will pay Pyramid for the machines.
But an AT&T spokesman said the "value to Pyramid is in the hundreds of millions of dollars over the next five years." 

The announcement was made after the stock market closed, but some word may have trickled out earlier in the day.
Pyramid stock closed up $1.25 at $16 a share on high volume in national over-the-counter trading. 

The stock, which has traded in the range of $13 to $15 over the past 12 trading days, was battered down to $9.75 earlier in the year when Pyramid said its third-quarter profit would be lower than expected because of late product introductions.
