The U.S. and Mexico signed agreements that cover trade, investment, the environment and tourism.
The accords coincide with a state visit here by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 

President Bush said at a White House signing ceremony that the accords "prove the special relationship" between the two nations, a relationship that he said has "never been stronger." 

U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills and Mexican Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche signed an understanding providing for talks between the two countries on trade and investment.
The two nations set a deadline of next summer for announcing initial results of these talks. 

Another accord seeks to strengthen bilateral efforts to boost trade and investment in Mexico by increasing the responsibilities of the two governments' joint promotion committee for investment and trade.
That panel will meet semiannually to strengthen cooperation on trade and investment and to improve the monitoring of investment flows between the two countries, the White House said. 

The two countries also committed themselves to cooperate in addressing air pollution problems in border areas and in Mexico City, and they agreed to increase their cooperation in the area of tourism.
