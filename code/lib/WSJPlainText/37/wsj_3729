Hospital Corp. of America, Nashville, Tenn., said it reached a new agreement in principle to sell its Australian operations to a local Australian buyer, who wasn't identified, at a price in excess of its previously announced agreement in principle with Mayne Nickless Ltd., Melbourne, Australia. 

HCA said the terms of its new agreement call for a purchase price of $68.3 million for its equity interest in the Australian operations and the repayment of certain debt owed to Hospital Corp. by its Australian subsidiary. 

HCA said it terminated its earlier $65.8 million agreement with Mayne Nickless. 

The Australian operations include 10 hospitals, a clinical medical practice and a clinical reference laboratory. 

HCA said completion of the transaction is subject to, among other things, approval by HCA's board and the proposed buyer's receipt of financing.
The company said it expects to complete the transaction in 30 days.
