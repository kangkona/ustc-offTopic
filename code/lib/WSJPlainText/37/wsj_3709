In an expensive attempt to differentiate itself from other cable networks, USA Network has acquired broadcast rights to 26 films from Walt Disney Co. 's Touchstone Pictures. 

USA and Disney declined to disclose financial terms, but industry officials estimated the deal was worth about $52 million, or $2 million a film. 

The agreement marks the first time a movie package will bypass syndication to TV stations and instead go to a basic cable system.
Some of the movies, including "Good Morning, Vietnam," "Three Men and a Baby" and "Big Business," have been shown on the pay-TV service Showtime and will be shown on a broadcast network before being aired on USA. 

But typically ad-supported networks like USA don't get movies until after they've been shown on virtually every other medium, including syndication to TV stations. 

The Touchstone films are expected to be critical in USA Network's plan to have two nights of prime-time movies, perhaps Tuesday and Wednesday.
USA, a joint venture of Paramount Communications Inc. and MCA Inc., already airs made-for-TV films once a month. 

USA Network outbid a group of broadcast stations as well as another pay-cable service for the Touchstone package, said an individual close to the process.
That competitive bidding, an analyst said, diminished the notion that Touchstone couldn't sell the package to a broadcast operator, so instead sold it to USA Network.
