Ford Motor Co. said it is notifying owners of 178,000 of its 1988-model Ford Taurus, Mercury Sable and Lincoln Continental cars about two separate problems unrelated to safety. 

The first affects about 70,000 Taurus, Sable and Continental vehicles equipped with 3.8-liter engines.
Ford said power-steering pump pulleys could separate from the engine, causing a loss of power steering.
The separation could also cause a loss of power to certain other accessories. 

Ford said owners should return the cars to dealers so the pulleys can be replaced.
Ford will contact owners by mail and will cover all costs of parts and labor. 

In a second action, Ford will extend by 24 months the warranty coverage for a part in the air-conditioning system of about 108,000 Taurus and Sable cars equipped with 3.0-liter engines.
The auto maker said the compressor shaft seal could fail, causing the air conditioners in these models to break down.
The normal warranty period for such parts is 12 months or 12,000 miles. 

If owners have a problem with the car, the company will cover the costs of parts and labor.
Owners who have already paid for repairs will be reimbursed.
