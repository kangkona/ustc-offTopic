A group including Special Situation Investment Holdings Ltd., a Washington, D.C., investment firm, said it raised its stake in Prism Entertainment Corp. to 11.9% of the common shares outstanding. 

In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group said it holds 262,500 Prism common shares, including 35,500 shares bought from March 23 to Sept. 28 for $2.625 to $3.50 each. 

No reason was given in the filing for the increase in the group's Prism holdings. 

KuwAm Corp., also of Washington, D.C., is the general partner of Special Situation Investment. 

In Los Angeles, Prism said Special Situation's investment is "strictly passive." Special Situation has been an investor in Prism for about two years, said Earl Rosenstein, Prism's senior vice president and chief financial officer.
