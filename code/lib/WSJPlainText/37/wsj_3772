Southmark Corp., facing a court challenge, said its bankruptcy-law proceedings will move to Dallas from Atlanta. 

The company had sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in Atlanta in July because its legal counsel was there and its chairman and chief executive officer, Arthur G. Weiss, lives there. 

But Consolidated Cos., a former Southmark unit that is operating under bankruptcy-law protection in Dallas, filed a motion last month to move the case, citing bankruptcy laws that require bankruptcy cases of affiliates to be held in the same place.
Southmark initially said it would fight the move and argued that it wasn't affiliated with Consolidated because it gave back its stock in Consolidated before Consolidated filed for protection early this year. 

However, Southmark, a real estate and thrift concern, said it changed its mind after the Atlanta bankruptcy judge last week issued a stay halting any action in the Southmark bankruptcy case until the matter is resolved. 

"It was possible for this case to become bogged down" over where it should be held, delaying an infusion of capital to the company's thrift and tying up other matters, Mr. Weiss said. "We think a fight could have been a disaster, getting us in a position where nothing could be decided." 

As part of agreeing to move the case, Southmark said that previous actions of the Atlanta judge will stand.
For instance, an Atlanta lawyer who was named an examiner to look into allegations of fraud and mismanagement will continue in that role, Southmark said. 

In Dallas, the case will be heard by Judge Steven A. Felsenthal and will remain separate from the Consolidated case.
Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate but is protected from creditors while it tries to work out a plan to pay its debts.
