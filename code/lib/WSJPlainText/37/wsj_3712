President Bush, speaking to the World Bank/IMF annual meeting last week in Washington: 

The Peruvian economist, Hernando de Soto, has helped us understand a worldwide economic phenomenon.
By walking the streets of Lima, not analyzing economic statistics, he found that the poor of Latin America -- who have never read Jefferson or Adam Smith -- ran their affairs democratically, outside the formal economy, organizing their private, parallel economy in a free and unregulated manner. 

De Soto's great contribution has been to point out what, in retrospect, may seem obvious: People everywhere want the same things.
And when left alone by government, people everywhere organize their lives in remarkably similar ways. 

De Soto's prescription offers a clear and promising alternative to economic stagnation in Latin America and other parts of the world.
Governments must bring the "informal" workers into the regular economy -- and then get out of the way and let individual enterprise flourish. 

From a recent Manhattan Institute report to HUD Secretary Jack Kemp by Peter Salins and Gerard Mildner: 

If the federal government is conditioning foreign aid to Hungary and Poland on economic reforms and decontrol of prices, why shouldn't housing assistance to New York City and Washington D.C. be conditioned on housing reform and decontrol of rents?
