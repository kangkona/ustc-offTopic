Sun Microsystems Inc., Mountain View, Calif., indicated that its painful management problems are coming under control, saying it expects to report that it broke even on revenue of $530 million in its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30. 

The company's preliminary estimate is in line with most analysts' projections. 

The fast-growing computer maker stumbled this summer when it introduced a bevy of new products at the same time a new computerized information system sprouted problems.
The company also was hurt by difficulties in predicting demand for its new models. 

As a result, Sun had a loss of $20.3 million on revenue of $431 million for its fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30. 

Sun declined to offer details, but in a statement said the improvement in its operations was mainly a result of "higher unit volumes of new products and, second, expense and headcount controls that have slowed expense growth." 

In national over-the-counter trading, Sun closed yesterday at $15.375 a share, down 50 cents.
