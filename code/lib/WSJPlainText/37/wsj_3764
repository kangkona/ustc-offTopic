Neoax Inc. said it completed the sale of its Superior Air Parts Inc. unit to SP Acquisitions Corp. for about $30 million and will post a fourth-quarter net gain of $6 million from the sale. 

Superior, a supplier of replacement parts for piston aircraft engines, is the third sale of a unit by Neoax's precision component business.
Proceeds from the three sales totaled $200 million, with pretax gains of $83 million.
The company said $77 million of the gains will be included in third-quarter results. 

In the 1988 fourth quarter, the Stamford, Conn.-based company had a loss of $11 million on sales of $100 million. 

Neoax said proceeds from the sales will be used to reduce debt and preferred-stock obligations.
It said the sales will let it concentrate on its core business of providing waste management services to industrial customers. 

SP Acquisitions is a new company formed by HMA Investments Inc.
