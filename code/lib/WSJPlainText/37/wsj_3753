Bristol-Myers Co. and Squibb Corp. said their stockholders approved the merger of the two pharmaceutical firms.
The transaction thus becomes effective today, the companies said. 

Squibb is being merged into Bristol-Myers through a tax-free exchange of 2.4 shares of Bristol-Myers common for each Squibb common share outstanding. 

To facilitate the merger, Bristol-Myers holders also voted to double the authorized common to 1.5 billion shares.
The company is issuing 242 million shares in connection with the merger.
Bristol-Myers has about 288.1 million shares outstanding. 

The new concern, to be known as Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and based in New York, will be the world's second-largest pharmaceutical firm, the companies said.
Richard L. Gelb, who has been chairman and chief executive officer of Bristol-Myers, will continue in those capacities.
Richard M. Furlaud, who has been chairman and chief executive of Squibb, will be president of the combined company with designated responsibility for its pharmaceutical business.
