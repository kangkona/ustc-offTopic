MB Group PLC, a British packaging and building-supplies concern, launched a friendly #337.6 million ($544.7 million) bid for rival British building-materials maker Caradon PLC. 

The bid, widely anticipated in the month since Caradon announced it received a takeover approach, is valued at 550 pence a Caradon share. 

MB's move, which received the recommendation of the Caradon board before its announcement, already has fetched acceptances from shareholders representing 35.8% of Caradon's 61.4 million shares. 

Antony Hichens, Caradon's chairman, said the bid would prove "good not only for our shareholders, but also for employees and management," with the combined businesses "intent on expansion." 

Caradon makes showers and baths, waste and rainwater systems and plastic-timber replacements.
The company estimated its pretax profit for the six months to Oct. 1 at #17 million, a 10% rise from #15.4 million a year ago.
