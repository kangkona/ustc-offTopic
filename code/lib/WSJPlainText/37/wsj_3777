Boston Edison Co., an electric utility, said it reached a tentative agreement with the state of Massachusetts under which it won't request a rate increase for three years and will report a $60 million charge. 

The charge will occur because Boston Edison agreed it won't seek to recover costs incurred during a 32-month shutdown of its Pilgrm Nuclear Power Plant that was criticized by federal regulators. 

The settlement, reached between the utility, the state attorney general's office, the state executive office of energy resources, and several other parties, is subject to approval by the state Department of Public Utilities. 

Boston Edison said the quarter in which the charge is made will depend on when the agreement is approved. 

Under the plan, the Boston-based utility will drop the pending $85.8 million, 8.4% rate increase request and begin a three-year plan to stabilize costs to customers while adjusting revenue by 2% to 2.4% annually over a three-year period.
