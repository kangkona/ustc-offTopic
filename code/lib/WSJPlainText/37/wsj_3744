The Senate agreed to expand Medicaid to cover the treatment of indigent drug addicts and to add 1,000 Federal Bureau of Investigation agents to the war on drugs. 

The provisions, both approved on voice votes, were added to a pending anti-drug measure that was quickly becoming a catchall for lawmakers' pet drug-related projects. 

Currently, Medicaid, which is administered by the states, won't pay for most drug-treatment programs because medical authorities don't agree on the best way to treat most addictions.
The provision, offered by Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D., N.Y.), would expand Medicaid coverage to pay for services provided to recipients who are addicted to drugs and seek treatment. 

Mr. Moynihan estimated that the expansion would cost about $300 million annually.
About 23.2 million people receive Medicaid payments, nearly half of them dependent children under age 21. 

Lawmakers also agreed to an amendment proposed by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden (D., Del.) authorizing $128.5 million in the current fiscal year to pay for 1,000 additional FBI agents assigned to investigate drug trafficking, 350 additional federal prosecutors and staff and 350 Drug Enforcement Administration agents with at least 250 of them assigned to rural areas.
An additional $26 million would go to the federal courts, public defenders and U.S. marshals.
