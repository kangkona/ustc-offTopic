Bonds prices crept higher yesterday, strengthened by a firmer dollar, by increased Japanese buying and by optimism that interest rates may decline. 

The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/2 point, or about $5 for each $1,000 face amount, while its yield slid to 8.17% from 8.21% Monday. 

Trading activity improved yesterday for the first time in two months, a sign that institutional investors are returning to the market after a long hiatus. 

"We saw the first glimmers of retail interest since we got the new supply at the August refunding," said Joseph Liro, a vice president and money market economist at S.G. Warburg Securities & Co.
He said it appears that portfolio managers "may want to get involved one more time before the end of the year." 

Treasury bond prices opened on a positive note during overnight trading in Japan, rising with the dollar as it firmed against most major currencies despite repeated intervention by central banks.
The dollar ended in Tokyo, for example, at 140.65 yen, up from 139.68 in New York late Monday afternoon and 139.39 earlier Monday in Tokyo. 

The dollar's resiliency "made {U.S.} Treasury bonds look a lot more interesting to Japanese investors," said Michael Moore, manager of government trading at Continental Bank, Chicago. 

Traders said prices continued to rise in the U.S. as the dollar established new highs on reports that Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega may have been toppled in an attempted coup d'etat. 

"The unrest in Panama may have triggered a flight to quality, and that helped the dollar, and the dollar helped bonds," said John Lonski, senior economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc. 

Bond prices also were supported by speculation that the Federal Reserve -- which has been unable to control the dollar through intervention alone -- may consider lowering interest rates as a new tactic. 

However, most economists believe that the Fed hasn't any plans to lower rates anytime soon, especially in the face of evidence that the economy is growing at an acceptable pace.
Moreover, Fed officials have made it clear in the past that the dollar shouldn't be a primary focus of monetary policy. 

Still, comments by White House economist Michael Boskin may have added fuel to the speculation about lower interest rates.
Mr. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, told economists in Tokyo that the U.S. economy would return to an annual 3% growth rate in the middle of next year.
Speaking at a meeting hosted by the Japanese Economic Planning Agency, Mr. Boskin based the outlook on lower interest rates, according to a Japanese news service. 

The bond market seemed to shrug off stronger-than-expected economic data.
The Commerce Department reported that new factory orders in August rose 2.9% and that sales of new single-family homes fell 0.4% in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 755,000. 

Based on surveys of economists conducted by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, new single-family homes were expected to have been sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 697,000 in August and factory orders were expected to have gained 2%. 

Treasury Securities 

Treasury securities rose moderately yesterday as the dollar gained strength on foreign exchange markets. 

The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 99 15/32 compared with 98 30/32 Monday.
The latest 10-year notes were quoted at 98 17/32 to yield 8.20% compared with 98 3/32 to yield 8.27% Monday.
The latest two-year notes ended at 100 to yield 8.34% compared with 99 26/32 to yield 8.45%. 

Short-term interest rates fell sharply.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.76% for a bond equivalent yield of 8%, while six-month bills ended with a discount rate of 7.85% for a yield of 8.26%. 

In the agency market, Federal National Mortgage Association issued $700 million of 10-year debentures priced at 99.875 to yield 9.019%. 

Corporate Issues 

Corporate bonds rose about 1/4 higher. 

Among new issues, Illinois Central Railroad Co. tapped the market for $145 million in junk bonds. 

The 12-year senior subordinated debentures were priced at 98.57 to yield 14.375% through Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
The debentures, noncallable for five years, were said to have been oversubscribed with underwriters receiving commitments for the offering before pricing.
Illinois Central was spun off from IC Industries Inc. at the beginning of this year. 

Foreign Bonds 

Japanese government bonds fell as the dollar rose against the yen. 

The dollar ended in Tokyo at 140.65 yen, up from 139.70 yen in New York late Monday and 139.39 yen in Tokyo Monday. 

Japan's benchmark No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 fell 0.38 to end at 95.99, yielding 5.7%. 

But in West Germany and Britain, bonds finished a little higher. 

Mark bonds rose about 0.15 point in trading dominated by professionals. 

Volume was low as retail investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of the Bundesbank's Central Bank Council meeting tomorrow.
Most economists and analysts expect the council to raise West Germany's Lombard and discount rates by half a percentage point or perhaps a full point.
The discount rate is currently 5%.
The Lombard rate, the effective ceiling on overnight bank loans, is 7%. 

Germany's 6 3/4% issue due June 1999 rose 0.197 to finish at 98.25, yielding 6.998%, while the 6 3/4% notes due 1994 rose 0.22 to 98.15 to yield 7.25%. 

In Britain, the government's benchmark 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 rose 3/32 to end at 111 3/4 and yield 10.11%, while the Treasury's 11 3/4% notes due 1991 rose 1/32 to 98 5/8 to yield 12.88%. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities 

Mortgage securities ended 9/32 to 12/32 higher as active issues finished at session highs. 

Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for October delivery ended at 97 4/32, up 3/8, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9% securities were at 96 9/32, up 9/32. 

Dealers said activity was moderate. 

Ginnie Mae 9% securities yielded 9.53% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note held at 1.33 percentage points.
The 10-year note was up about 14/32 at 98 19/32. 

In derivative markets, Federal National Mortgage Association offered a $200 million real estate mortgage investment conduit backed by principal-only mortgage securities through Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. 

Municipals 

Moderating supply continued to prop up prices of municipal bonds, which were 1/4 to 1/2 point higher on the day in late trading. 

Pennsylvania's $550 million tax-anticipation note sale topped the municipal newissue slate yesterday.
Eleven firms submitted bids for the notes, with Goldman, Sachs & Co. ultimately winning the largest share.
Goldman Sachs, bidding alone, was awarded $350 million of the notes. 

The average winning net interest cost for the $550 million Pennsylvania note issue was 6.35%, according to Arthur Heilman, director of Pennsylvania's Bureau of Revenues, Cash Flow and Debt. 

The notes are due June 28, 1990. 

On the long-term side of the market, underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets had the winning bid for $90 million New York State certificates of participation, due 1990 to 1996.
