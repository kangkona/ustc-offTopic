Crazy Eddie Inc. said that it will file a plan of liquidation and that it plans to close its remaining 18 stores. 

The Edison, N.J., electronics retailer, which had filed for court protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, changed its filing to Chapter 7 of the code, which seeks a liquidation. 

The action followed a board meeting Monday evening, a spokeswoman said.
Crazy Eddie previously had said it intended to seek to reorganize around the remaining stores, but the board determined the reorganization wasn't feasible.
The dominant factor, the spokeswoman said, was the inability to obtain sufficient vendor credit to sustain continuing operations. 

As of May 28, Crazy Eddie had a negative net worth of $26.7 million.
The company said that because its liabilities greatly exceed assets, stockholders won't receive any distribution in the liquidation. 

"It's unfortunate to see it happen, but there was significant warning that they had dire financial problems," said James R. Williamson, chief financial officer of Trans World Music Corp., which has leased space in Crazy Eddie stores for the past 18 months.
As a result of Crazy Eddie's decision, Trans World, based in Albany, N.Y., said it would incur an after-tax charge of $540,000, or six cents a share, in the third quarter to write off leases in those stores. 

The spokeswoman said she was "unsure" when Crazy Eddie would permanently close its doors.
Crazy Eddie began with a single store in Brooklyn, N.Y., 19 years ago and blossomed to a peak of 42 outlets. 

A creditors group's attorney, Michael S. Fox of the firm Traub, Bonacquist, Yellen & Fox, said he wouldn't comment on Crazy Eddie's plan "until my clients and I have had a chance to caucus on the matter." 

Crazy Eddie's downward turn began about 2 1/2 years ago when it sought Chapter 11 protection.
