International Business Machines Corp. said it is offering a holiday promotion involving personal computers at the low end and in the middle of its PS/2 line. 

IBM's stock price skidded $2.625 to $106 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, and securities analysts said the rebate program may have made investors nervous about the state of IBM's personal-computer business.
They added, though, that sentiment on IBM has been negative since it announced an earnings disappointment a week ago.
The stock has fallen more than $10 since then. 

The promotion, which runs from Oct. 1 through Jan. 15, will give buyers of certain models five software programs, including money management and game programs, valued at more than $500.
Some buyers who apply for an IBM credit card may also be eligible for as much as $3,500 in credit, with the first payment deferred until February and no interest charge during the promotion.
The computer company also is offering a $200 rebate to buyers of the Model 55SX. 

Matt Fitzsimmons, owner of a large ComputerLand franchise in North White Plains, N.Y., said the rebate on the Model 55SX surprised him, because it's one of his hottest-selling items at the moment.
Still, IBM and other personal-computer makers typically offer promotions around the busy Christmas season.
