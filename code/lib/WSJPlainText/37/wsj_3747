General Electric Capital Corp., a unit of General Electric Co., agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it discriminated against certain credit applicants because of their age, sex and marital status. 

Under the consent order, the company will pay $275,000 in civil penalties and is prohibited from future violations of the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act.
The penalty is the largest the commission has levied in a credit-discrimination case. 

The FTC claims that as part of the company's so-called instant-credit program, it required applicants to be employed full time, which discriminated against people whose income was from part-time work, pensions, public assistance, alimony or child support.
The commission said that excluding those sources of income discriminated against the elderly and divorced women credit applicants. 

GE Capital said the decree didn't constitute an admission of the alleged violations.
It said it signed the decree "to avoid protracted and expensive litigation." A spokeswoman said that in the summer of 1986, GE Capital discontinued the requirement that applicants have full-time jobs to receive accelerated approval under an "instant credit" feature, which permits applicants who meet predetermined credit standards to receive accelerated approval.
