On Wednesday, the market opened bullishly with high turnover, ignoring the volatility in New York stocks.
But losers were spread in a broad range by the end of the session.
A trader said that the more an issue gained recently, the sharper the loss sustained Wednesday. 

A trader at Yamaichi Securities said the market's mood was undercut by the continuing fall of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone shares, which declined to their lowest level since the begining of this year.
NTT lost 30,000 yen to 1,380,000 yen ($9,756). 

Some traders noted individual investors dumped NTT shares amid growing expectation for a division of the company as suggested by a recent government-sponsored panel. 

Dealers said they also took profits to reduce holdings in their own account at the end of the October transaction period. 

Among pharmaceutical shares, Chugai lost 60 yen to 2,290 yen ($16.20), and Mochida fell 150 to 4,290.

London share prices closed modestly higher largely on technical factors, although the market was underpinned near the end of the session by Wall Street's firmer trend.

The 30-share index ended 12.6 points higher at 1751.9.
Volume was thin at 374.6 million shares traded, down from 405.4 million Tuesday. 

Dealers said the market gained some late steam on a flurry of buying by market-makers looking at blue-chip issues and stocks viewed as oversold during the market's recent downtrend. 

Outside what essentially amounted to a bookkeeping exercise, dealers said London dealings were largely dulled by the absence of active interest beyond the market-makers. 

The late buying was drawn into the London market, dealers added, after Wall Street showed signs of stability following its rocky opening. 

Stocks that suffered on the day were those with active U.S. operations, dealers noted.
Among them were B.A.T Industries, which settled 6 pence a share lower at 753 ($12.10).
Hanson, with 15 million shares traded, closed 2.5 lower at 212.5. 

Dealers said the shares were hit by fears of a slowdown in the U.S. economy. 

Cable & Wireless benefited from a market squeeze, bouncing 13 to 498 in moderately active volume. 

Jaguar was boosted 21 to 715 on follow-through buying after Ford Motor's announcement Tuesday that it might be prepared to mount a full bid for the U.K. luxury auto maker.
It was further helped by Ford, which announced after London's close that it had raised its stake to 12% from just under 11% on Tuesday. 

Frankfurt prices closed sharply lower in thin dealings, hurt by the roller-coaster session on Wall Street Tuesday and worries about wage demands by the largest West German trade union.
The German stock index tumbled 26.29 to end at 

"It was dead, listless, depressing and negative," said one trader at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt. "There was little turnover and nothing to stimulate the market." 

Equities tumbled at the opening as Tuesday's gyrations on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered most of an 80-point loss, fueled fears of another stock market crash, brokers said. 

Tough talk from trade union officials at the conference of the powerful IG Metall metals worker union in West Berlin raised the specter of nationwide strikes next spring, they said.
For the 1990 wage negotiations, the IG Metall is demanding a further cut in the German workweek and steep wage increases, which could sharply increase the costs for German industry. 

"All the positive figures on the economy are out already, and people are focusing more on the dangers for next year, mostly the wage talks and the {parliamentary} elections," the U.S. trader said.
The market also shrugged off positive factors, such as higher bond prices and a slowdown in monetary growth in September, traders said. 

They said they expect the bearish mood to persist a while longer, as trading volume is falling toward the end of the year and the market is becoming more volatile. 

In the auto sector, Bayerische Motoren Werke plunged 14.5 marks to 529 marks ($288), Daimler-Benz dropped 10.5 to 700, and Volkswagen slumped 9 to 435.5. 

Continental gave up some of its recent gains, dropping 8 to 338, as rumors of an impending takeover attempt for the tiremaker faded, brokers said.

Other banks were slightly more resilient, with Dresdner Bank shedding 4.8 to 320, and Commerzbank slipping 2.5 to
