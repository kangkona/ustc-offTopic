French chemicals group, Orkem S.A., said Wednesday it has made a bid for control of Coates Brothers PLC, a British manufacturer of inks and polyester resins. 

State-controlled Orkem already owns 40.6% of Coates.
The remainder is held by the public and by family interests, a spokeswoman for the French group said. 

Orkem declined to give details of its offer, saying only that the bid will be submitted for approval by the board of the British company.
