Spiegel Inc., citing continuing improvement in the apparel market, said third-quarter net income jumped 65% from the soft year-earlier period, on an 11% increase in revenue. 

The catalog retailer reported net income of $10.8 million, or 21 cents a share, up sharply from $6.6 million, or 13 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose to $372.1 million from $336.4 million. 

Spiegel said margins improved because its inventory position this year didn't need the costly markdowns required to trim last year's swollen levels.
A spokeswoman said the apparel market troughed in the first half of 1988, then began showing improvement in the second half of last year. "We've seen continued improvement in 1989," she said. 

The year-ago quarter's results were crimped by expenses associated with Spiegel's $260 million acquisition of catalog-clothing-merchandiser Eddie Bauer, Spiegel noted.
In addition, the company said ongoing cost-cutting efforts contributed to the latest period's earnings upturn. 

Spiegel is 84%-controlled by the Otto family of West Germany.
In national over-the-counter trading, the company's shares climbed 37.5 cents to $20.375. 

For the latest nine months, Spiegel's net climbed a solid 47% to $23.8 million, or 46 cents a share, from $16.2 million, or 34 cents.
Unlike the quarter's results, which were based on roughly equal shares outstanding, nine-month per-share figures reflect an increase in average common shares outstanding to 51.9 million from 47 million.
Nine-month revenue was $1.02 billion, up 22% from $841.5 million.
