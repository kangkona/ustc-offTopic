Hughes Aircraft Co., a General Motors Corp. unit, said the Intelsat VI commercial communications satellite is set to be launched Friday. 

The satellite, built by Hughes for the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, is part of a $700 million contract awarded to Hughes in 1982 to develop five of the three-ton satellites.
