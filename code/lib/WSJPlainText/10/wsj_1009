Levi Strauss Associates Inc., the closely held owner of Levi Strauss & Co., said its fiscal third-quarter earnings jumped to $128.6 million from $31.3 million a year earlier, aided by a $69.8 million gain from the sale of stock in a Japanese subsidiary.

The company said its quarterly results are now being publicly filed as the result of the formation earlier this year of employee stock investment plans.
