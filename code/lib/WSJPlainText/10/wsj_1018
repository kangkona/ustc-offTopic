Rupert Murdoch acquired a 25% stake in Grupo Zeta S.A., the leading Spanish magazine and newspaper publisher said. 

The transaction called for Mr. Murdoch's News International PLC, a unit of Australia-based News Corp., to subscribe to a rights issue by Zeta valued at 6.65 billion pesetas ($57 million).
Also participating in the issue was Servifilm Spain Cinematografica S.A.
The film producer, owned by Madrid-based financier Jacques Hachuel, received a 5% stake in the Barcelona-based publishing group. 

The cash injection boosted Zeta's capital more than four-fold, to 8.47 billion pesetas from 1.82 billion pesetas, greatly enhancing the group's ability to make investments, Zeta officials said.
Following its failure last month to win a license for one of Spain's first three private television stations, Zeta is seeking investment opportunities in communications and publishing. 

With annual sales of about 30 billion pesetas, Zeta publishes over a dozen magazines, including the popular Tiempo, Interviu and Panorama, and three regional dailies.
Chairman Antonio Asensio will retain a 70% share in Zeta.
