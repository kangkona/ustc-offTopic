Birmingham Steel Corp. said that its Emeryville, Calif., minimill sustained only minor damage from last week's earthquake. 

Steelmaking resumed Oct. 18, but the company expects production to be hampered in the next few months by traffic disruptions around the plant and outages for repair to gas and electric power systems.
