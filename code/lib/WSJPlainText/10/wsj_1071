Ryder System Inc. posted a third-quarter net loss of $27.6 million, because of an expected $57 million after-tax charge and continued weakness in the company's truck-rental business. 

The loss, which is 38 cents a share, is the transportation services concern's first quarterly setback in more than a decade and compares with net income of $55.3 million, or 68 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
The previous year's third quarter included gains on the sale of aircraft by the company's Aviation Leasing & Services Division.
Revenue was flat at $1.3 billion. 

The latest quarter's after-tax charge -- which is 75 cents a share -- was related to adjustments to reserves for workers' compensation claims; reductions in vehicle fleets, staff and facilities; and writedowns of assets.
Although Ryder didn't break out the charge, analysts estimated that the majority of the $57 million was linked to workers' compensation reserves and anticipated losses on the disposal of trucks. 

Many analysts said they weren't surprised that problems in many of Ryder's lines of business continued to plague the company. "It pretty much confirms what we had been expecting," said Anthony Hatch, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Ryder closed at $22.25, down 37.5 cents. 

M. Anthony Burns, Ryder's chairman and chief executive officer, said: "We're constantly trying to find ways to regain the earnings momentum.
But we're still at the beginning stages of some of these changes." He said the fourth quarter will be "challenging," and maintained his conservative forecast that 1990 "won't be a barn burner." 

In the nine months, net income fell 79% to $31.1 million, or 33 cents a share, from $149.3 million, or $1.82 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose slightly to $3.8 billion from $3.7 billion.
