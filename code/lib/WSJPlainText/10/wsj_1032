Beghin-Say S.A. said that it plans to sell its remaining paper operations by the end of January as part of a drive to refocus on the food sector and lower its debt. 

The French unit of Ferruzzi Agricola Finanziaria also disclosed a 40% rise in its consolidated net profit for the first half of 1989, excluding nonrecurring items and after payments to minority interests. 

Beghin-Say said the sale will be done in two parts and will raise a total of 2.025 billion francs ($325 million).
This will include the sale of its interest in the joint venture Beghin Corbehem to Feldemuehle AG.
The West German paper company entered the venture in April 1988 by acquiring a 50% stake, also from Beghin-Say. 

The other part of the transaction will see Beghin-Say sell its 50% stake in its Kaysersberg paper affiliate to an unspecified unit of the petrochemical group Montedison S.p.
A., which is also controlled by Ferruzzi. 

And in a separate transaction, Beghin-Say will sell its remaining 25% interest in A.T.B., a holding company for international trading assets, to an unspecified unit of Ferruzzi for 258 million francs.
