The White House called on Congress to attach the proposed capital-gains tax cut to its final deficit-reduction bill, but lawmakers seem likely to balk at the idea. 

Earlier this month, the White House endorsed stripping the controversial tax measure from the bill so that Congress could pass quickly a "clean" bill containing only provisions specifically designed to meet federal budget targets under the Gramm-Rudman act. 

But now that Congress has missed the legal deadline for meeting the Gramm-Rudman targets, the White House said it has returned to its original view that a capital-gains cut should be part of the deficit-reduction bill, on which Congress continues to work. "If that doesn't happen, then we press forward on another vehicle and a separate vote," said press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. 

On Capitol Hill, though, there doesn't seem to be sufficient sentiment to pair capital gains and the deficit-reduction bill.
Texas Rep. William Archer, the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee said, "I don't see how we have the votes" to place a capital-gains tax cut there. 

Meanwhile, President Bush stepped up his personal lobbying for the capital-gains tax cut.
The White House said he plans to hold a series of private White House meetings, mostly with Senate Democrats, to try to persuade lawmakers to fall in line behind the tax cut. 

The first meeting yesterday was with 10 Senate Democrats who have expressed an interest in cutting the tax.
According to some who attended, the senators argued that the president should give the Democratic leaders in Congress a victory of their own to compensate them for allowing the president to win on the controversial capital-gains issue.
Issues discussed in this context were an increase in the minimum wage and an increase in child-care spending.
The president was said to have been noncommittal.
