Genentech Inc. said third-quarter profit more than doubled to $11.4 million, or 13 cents a share, from a depressed 1988 third-quarter performance of $5.3 million, or six cents a share. 

Revenue rose 23% to $100 million from $81.6 million.
Net product sales accounted for $76 million, up from $57.5 million a year earlier. 

Sales of the heart drug TPA were $43.6 million, better than last year's depressed third period when the company sold just $29.1 million of the drug.
But TPA sales fell below levels for this year's first and second quarter sales of $48 million, cooling investors.
Genentech stock fell 12.5 cents in trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange to $20.125. 

In the nine months, net income slid 21% to $28.4 million, or 33 cents a share, from $36 million, or 42 cents a share.
Revenues climbed 18% to $289 million from $245.3 million. 

"We continue to be on target for . . . increasing ÕTPAå sales 20% to 25% this year," said founder and Chief Executive Officer Robert Swanson.
But some analysts remain sour on the company. 

"TPA sales are down quarter to quarter.
Expenses are flat and that's a good sign.
There's contract revenue from {limited research and development} partnerships.
But I still think the fundamentals are poor," said Denise Gilbert, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. 

Genentech faces competition in the cardiac-drug market from SmithKline Beecham PLC's heart drug Eminase, expected to receive market approval shortly.
And Genentech isn't likely to have any new products ready for market until at least 1992, Ms. Gilbert added. "The company's stock is trading at 40 times next year's numbers, and that's too much," she said. 

On the plus side, Genentech is benefiting from a lower tax rate due to its research outlays, giving a boost to earnings, she said.
