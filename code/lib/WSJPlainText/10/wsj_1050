StatesWest Airlines, Phoenix, Ariz., said it sent a more detailed merger proposal to much-larger Mesa Airlines. 

Farmington, N.M.-based Mesa has consistently rejected StatesWest's offers, and early this week said its board wouldn't give the proposal further consideration, calling it "vague and ill-defined" because it didn't describe the source of funds or the specific terms of StatesWest securities which were part of the offer. 

The new letter purports to do this, saying that in addition to $7 a share in cash, StatesWest would offer one share of new 6% convertible preferred stock of StatesWest it values at $3 a share.
It also said the cash portion of the transaction would be financed with StatesWest's own cash and short-term investments, plus debt and other financing arranged through Hibbard Brown & Co., the company's investment banker. 

In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Mesa closed at $7.25, up 25 cents. 

StatesWest asked Mesa to repond by Oct. 31.
Mesa President Larry Risley said his board had received Stateswest's most recent offer and was reviewing it.
