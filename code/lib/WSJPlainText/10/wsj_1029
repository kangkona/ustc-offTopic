Bay Financial Corp., Boston, which has been reporting big losses and warning of a possible bankruptcy-law filing, said it was sued by a holder. 

The real estate investment trust said the "purported class action suit," seeks "damages and other remedies under federal securities law and state law." Gerald E. Wilson, corporate secretary and legal counsel, said the company wouldn't disclose further details.
He declined to name the shareholder, the plaintiff's lawyer or the court where the lawsuit was filed. 

Bay, which has substantial investments in the floundering Massachusetts market, reported a loss of $62 million, or $15.97 a share, for the fiscal year ended June 30.
It has said it might seek bankruptcy-court protection from creditor lawsuits if it can't renegotiate its borrowings. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Bay closed at $2.625, down 25 cents.
