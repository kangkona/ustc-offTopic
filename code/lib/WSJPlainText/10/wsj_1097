Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., buoyed by improved operating profit in its tire segment, reported that third-quarter net income rose 11% to $70.5 million, or $1.22 a share. 

In the year-ago period, Goodyear had net of $63.5 million, or $1.11 a share. 

Sales rose slightly to $2.68 billion, from $2.66 billion. 

Analysts had mixed responses to the results.
Donald DeScenza, an independent analyst in New Canaan, Conn., said he was "impressed with the company's performance." He said results were better than he'd expected and indicate that Goodyear is in the midst of a turnaround from a string of lackluster quarters that have plagued the company for a year. 

However, Harry Millis, an analyst at McDonald & Co., Cleveland, said Goodyear's results "fell at the bottom" of his range of estimates.
Excluding an increase in the tax rate and the effects of foreign currency translations, Mr. Millis said the company's results "were still a little disappointing." 

Goodyear's stock, which has been weak in recent weeks, fell $2.875 yesterday to close at $43.875 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

The Akron, Ohio-based company said pretax operating income in its tire segment jumped about 31% to $196.2 million from $150.2 million a year earlier, reflecting improvements in raw material costs, sales of replacement tires and pricing. 

McDonald's Mr. Millis said Goodyear appeared to have held or gained some market share in the U.S. for the first time since the second quarter of 1988. 

But Goodyear said total U.S. tire unit sales were off about 2%.
Total tire segment sales were up only about 1% to $2.2 billion, and the company said it reduced manufacturing levels at some of its U.S. tire plants because of inventory adjustments and slackened production by auto makers. 

In the latest quarter, Goodyear's tax rate was 51% compared with 41% a year earlier.
As a result, total tax outlays were $73.5 million, compared with $44.1 million the year earlier. 

For the nine months, profit skidded about 35%, reflecting charges taken in this year's second quarter and the effect of translations of weaker foreign currencies into the stronger U.S. dollar. 

Net was $192.1 million, or $3.33 a share, compared with net of $293.7 million, or $5.13 a share, the year earlier. 

The latest nine months included charges of $95 million related to the company's South African subsidiary and unused pipe sold by its crude oil pipeline unit. 

Sales rose nearly 2% to $8.13 billion from $7.98 billion.
