Dun & Bradstreet Corp. said business failures fell 17.8% to 11,586 in the third quarter from 14,099 in the year-earlier period. 

In the first nine months of this year, business failures dropped 15.6% to 37,820 from 44,796. 

Except for a few spots, notably Georgia, Virginia and Michigan, failures declined almost across the board, according to the business information services company.
D&B defines a business failure as a company that closes with losses to creditors. 

The current decline in failures continues a trend begun in late 1987, D&B said.
The drop accelerated in this year's third quarter, underscoring an overall lack of stress in the U.S. economy, the company said. 

Failures in seven of nine regional areas fell more than 10% in the nine months.
The South Atlantic States were the only region to report an increase in bankruptcies, up 5.3% to 5,791 from 5,502.
This occurred partly because of more competition as the number of new businesses surged. 

The only industry sector to report more business failures for the nine months was the finance, insurance and real-estate sector, where bankruptcies grew 8.1% to 2,046 from 1,892.
The troubled savings-and-loan industry and subsequent stress in real-estate businesses fueled bankruptcies in this sector, D&B said.
