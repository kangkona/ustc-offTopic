Environmental Control Group Inc. said it expects to report "minimal" earnings or a loss for the third quarter. 

The environmental services company said that the discontinuation of unsuccessful product lines and an increase in baddebt reserves probably will result in charges of $2.5 million to $4 million, most of which will be taken against third-quarter results. 

In the year-ago quarter, the company reported earnings of $2.2 million, or 35 cents a share.
