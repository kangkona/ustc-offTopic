Businessland Inc. said it purchased a major regional computer retailer, Data Systems Computer Centre Inc., Springfield, New Jersey.
Terms weren't disclosed. 

The purchase strengthens San Jose, Calif.-based Businessland's links to the large corporations who are among the biggest buyers of computers.
Data Systems has five retail stores in the northeast, but specializes in selling personal computers made by International Business Machines Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. to banks, brokerage firms and other big businesses based in the New York metropolitan area. 

John Fitzsimmons, chief executive officer of Data Systems, said the company was profitable and expected sales of nearly $100 million this year.
He said Businessland, which operates stores in 50 U.S. metropolitan areas, planned to absorb his firm's operations.
