A group including New York investors Douglas A. Kass and Anthony Pedone holds the equivalent of a 12.6% stake in H.H. Robertson Co. 's common shares outstanding, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Officials of Pittsburgh-based H.H. Robertson, which makes steel roofs, store fronts and building parts, declined comment.
As reported last month, Mr. Kass said he was interested in making an offer to buy H.H. Robertson for $13 a share. 

In the SEC filing, the Kass-Pedone group said it intends to acquire additional H.H. Robertson shares "with a view towards a possible change in control of the company." It has not, however, made a formal proposal. 

The group also is engaged in talks with third parties regarding obtaining financing to buy more shares, but no agreements have yet been reached, the filing said. 

The group controls 795,900 H.H. Robertson common shares, assuming exercise of an option it acquired from Executive Life Insurance Co. to buy 497,400 shares.
Its stake includes 106,100 shares bought in the open market from Aug. 30 to Oct. 18 for $10.375 to $12.125 a share. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, H.H. Robertson closed at $11.625, up 62.5 cents.
