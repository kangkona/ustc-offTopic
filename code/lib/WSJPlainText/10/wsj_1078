Italian car manufacturer Fiat said it isn't interested in partnership or industrial cooperation with Swedish auto and aerospace group Saab-Scania AB, which faces heavy losses in its car division. 

Fiat said it's only interested in technical cooperation with Saab. 

"We know that Saab is looking for a partner for industrial and financial cooperation," Fiat said. "But that partner isn't Fiat." 

The Italian auto maker confirmed that it was discussing technical cooperation with Saab, but declined to comment on rumors that it was planning to buy Saab's car division. 

Fiat's rejection of partnership with Saab means that the Swedish company, which announced last Friday that its pretax profit for the first eight months plummeted 49%, will have to look for a partner among other car manufacturers as both Ford Motor Corp. and Fiat have turned down the offer. 

News reports said yesterday that Saab is trying to start negotiations with French automakers Peugeot and Renault.
