A round of futures-related program selling near the close sent the stock market lower in otherwise directionless trading. 

Nervousness that the market hasn't seen the last of its recent volatility kept trading at a moderate pace, as did anticipation of a report on the economy's third-quarter performance. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which plunged more than 80 points in early trading Tuesday and then recovered nearly all of its losses by the close, fell 5.94 to 2653.28 in the latest session. 

The average drifted in a trading range of about 30 points throughout the day.
The lower boundary was established just after the opening in a brief round of selling; the upper boundary was set at midday as scattered bargain-hunting pushed prices higher. 

Buying interest in Du Pont, which declared a stock split and a dividend boost, and certain other blue-chip issues gave the industrial average a better performance than broader indexes. 

Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index dropped 1.20 to 342.50; the decline was the equivalent of a nine-point setback in the 30-stock average.
The Dow Jones Equity Market Index fell 1.16 to 320.94 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index slid 0.53 to 189.52. 

But advancing issues topped decliners by 784 to 700 on the Big Board despite the late sell programs, resulting from stock-index arbitrage.
The programs occurred against the backdrop of a late pullback in UAL, which had held at slightly lower levels through most of the session amid optimism that another bidder might surface. 

Traders said program activity wasn't in evidence through most of the session, however, and Big Board volume dropped to 155,650,000 shares from about 238 million Tuesday as concerns about the potential for additional sharp swings in the market kept other trading in check. 

"People are sort of nervous to do anything in the market now.
Our phones are quiet around here," said Don R. Hays, director of investment strategy at Wheat First Butcher & Singer Inc., Richmond, Va. 

The gross national product report, due to be released before today's opening, is expected to show that the economy continued to expand in the third quarter at a moderate pace.
The consensus of economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report calls for a 2.5% annual growth rate for GNP during the quarter. 

Du Pont, which announced plans for a 3-for-1 stock split and raised its quarterly dividend by 14%, jumped 2 1/2 to 117 3/8.
The company also posted third-quarter earnings that were in line with analysts' forecasts.

Insurance stocks moved higher in the wake of a strong third-quarter earnings report from Chubb, coming on the heels of speculation that last week's devastating earthquake in the San Francisco area would lead to higher premium rates. 

Chubb, whose net income for the quarter exceeded most analysts' expectations, rallied 3 3/4 to 86 1/2.
Aetna Life & Casualty gained 1 3/8 to 61 1/8, Cigna advanced 7/8 to 64 3/4, Travelers added 1/2 to 40 3/8 and American International Group rose 3 1/8 to 107 3/4.

Coniston said it would pursue "various financing alternatives." 

UAL stock declined by 9 to 161 after nobody surfaced to claim credit for aggressive buying Tuesday by Bear Stearns that sent UAL stock up 35 points in a matter of hours.
Tuesday's rumored buyer, Coniston Partners, wouldn't comment on speculation that Coniston, which battled the UAL board in 1987, might challenge the board's decision Monday to remain independent.
