U.S. Memories Inc., the venture that seeks to crack Japan's domination of the memory-chip market, said it has chosen four potential sites for its operations after a fierce bidding war by 15 states. 

U.S. Memories said it will begin visits during the next several weeks to sites in Austin, Texas; Colorado Springs, Colo.; Middletown, N.Y.; and Phoenix, Ariz.
Sanford Kane, president, said the finalists were chosen from among 57 locations based on financial, business, and quality of life considerations. 

Conspicuous by its absence is California.
San Jose and several other California cities mounted major campaigns during the summer to woo the group, which was founded last June by seven electronics concerns. 

The venture plans to announce a final site by late November.
It expects to begin construction by year end and start shipping four-megabit dynamic random-access memory chips by mid-1991. 

U.S. Memories investors include Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., International Business Machines Corp., Intel Corp., LSI Logic Corp., and National Semiconductor Corp. Mr. Kane said he expects several other companies to join some time after the venture completes a business plan, probably later this week.
