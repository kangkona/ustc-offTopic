Adolph Coors Co. said William K. Coors, chairman, assumed the additional responsibilities of president, succeeding Jeffrey H. Coors. 

Jeffrey Coors, 44 years old, had been president since 1985, when he succeeded his father Joseph in the job.
But the brewer said Jeffrey Coors voluntarily gave up the position to focus more of his energy on Coors Technology Co., a small unit of Coors he has run for several years. 

A Coors spokesman said the company doesn't believe the move will further increase William Coors's influence or reduce the influence of Jeffrey Coors, Peter Coors or Joseph Coors Jr., who run the company's three operating units. 

"It certainly wasn't intended to be a demotion," the spokesman said. "Pete and Jeff and Joe Jr. have taken over the reins and are doing most of the work.
We don't think this will affect that." 

Jeffrey, Peter and Joseph Jr. are brothers.
William Coors is their uncle.
Jeffrey, Peter, Joseph Jr., William and Joseph Sr. constitute the company's board. 

Peter Coors runs the Coors Brewing Co. unit, the nation's fourth-largest brewery that accounted for $1.24 billion of Adolph Coors's $1.52 billion in 1988 sales.
Joseph Jr. runs Coors Ceramics Co., the other operating unit, which had about $150 million in 1988 sales.
