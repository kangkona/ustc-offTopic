Christopher Cox's Oct. 13 editorial-page article "Toward More Crippling Lawsuits . . ." misses the point.
The 1989 Americans With Disabilities Act is about eliminating discriminatory barriers. 

When we look closely at our own history, it is clear that our constitutionally mandated civil rights have evolved not through the goodness of people's hearts but through legislation and constitutional amendments.
This is how American women won the right to vote.
And it is how African-Americans and other minority groups were guaranteed their equal rights as citizens in this nation. 

For the more than 43 million Americans with disabilities, the 1989 Americans With Disabilities Act provides the missing piece.
Disabled Americans have had their civil rights guaranteed in all federally funded programs since Section 504 was passed as a part of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act.
The 1989 act simply extends these guarantees to the private sector.
Those who fear a plethora of suits paralyzing our legal system need only look at the record on the Rehabilitation Act.
Without legal recourse, there are no guarantees of civil rights for anyone.
