Investors who received Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's latest stock commentary may be left with blank expressions. 

The first 10 pages of the 76-page Weekly Portfolio Perspective are completely blank, except for the page numbers.
Rather than printing devils, Shearson puts all the blame on the unpredictable stock market.
The plunge made Shearson's market commentary instantly out of date. 

In fact, last Friday's 190.58-point tumble in the stock market caught many people and businesses by surprise, not the least of them brokerage firms such as Shearson that print their weekly market commentaries on Fridays for dissemination the following week.
Shearson, a 62%-owned unit of American Express Co., didn't have enough time to update its market commentary so, "We decided to kill our strategy pieces," says Jack Rivkin, the head of Shearson's research department. 

The first thought some investors had was that a red-faced Shearson must have been wildly bullish on stocks in its original commentary, and that's why it purged its pages.
Investors recalled that Shearson last week had been advising that "the market is still exhibiting all the signs of a further advance." Many other brokerage firms had similarly bullish views. 

But Mr. Rivkin insists that the 10 pages weren't pulled because they were too bullish.
Instead, he says, "they were cautious, and that wasn't the message we wanted to deliver" on Monday. 

As Mr. Rivkin explains it, "We were raising some caution flags about rate rises in Europe and concerns about the LBO market.
And by late Friday afternoon, actually after the close, we decided that was the wrong tone to take.
With the market down, we wanted to tell people to put their orders in on the opening." 

Both before and after the Friday plunge, Shearson has maintained a recommended portfolio weighting of 65% stocks, 20% bonds and 15% cash.
