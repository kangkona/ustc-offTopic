American Brands Inc. said third-quarter net income rose 13%, reflecting strong gains in its tobacco and distilled spirits businesses. 

The company, which also has businesses in life insurance, office products and hardware, and home-improvement products, said net income rose to $166.4 million, or $1.71 a share, from $146.8 million, or $1.53 a share, a year earlier.
Year-earlier results for the quarter and the nine months were restated to reflect a change in accounting standards. 

Revenue declined 2%, to $3.06 billion from $3.13 billion, because of the sale of Southland Life in March, and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar on overseas results. 

Operating profit for world-wide tobacco products rose 10% to $247.6 million.
For distilled spirits, operating profit rose 36%, to $24.8 million. 

In the first nine months, net rose 1.5%, to $458.8 million, or $4.76 a share, from $452 million, or $4.50 a share, a year earlier.
The year-earlier period included $40.1 million, or 41 cents a share, from discontinued operations.
Revenue rose to $9.03 billion from $8.98 billion. 

The average number of shares outstanding rose 2% in the third quarter but was down 4% for the nine months. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, American Brands shares rose $1.75 to $73.
