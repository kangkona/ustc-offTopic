Textron Inc., hampered by a slowdown in its defense sales, reported an 8% decline in per-share earnings on nearly flat revenue for its third quarter. 

The aerospace and financial services concern said net income fell 5% to $59.5 million from $62.8 million.
Revenue of $1.73 billion was almost unchanged from last year's $1.72 billion.
Per-share net of 66 cents, down from 72 cents, fell by more than overall net because of more shares outstanding. 

The company said that improved results in its financial-services sector were negated by increased costs in its government contract business, lower operating earnings in its commercial-products sector and soft automotive markets.
Net was aided by a lower income tax rate.
Profit before taxes fell 17% to $84.4 million from $101.4 million. 

For the nine months, Textron reported net of $182.1 million, or $2.06 a share, on revenue of $5.41 billion.
A year ago, net was $170.4 million, or $1.93 a share, on revenue of $5.3 billion.
The nine-month results included a $9.5 million special charge in 1989 for an arbitration settlement related to past export sales, and $29.7 million in extraordinary charges in 1988 related to a former line of business and early redemption of debt. 

Textron said that nine-months' results don't include earnings of Avdel PLC, a British maker of industrial fasteners, but do include interest costs of $16.4 million on borrowings related to the proposed purchase of Avdel.
A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against the purchase because of Federal Trade Commission concerns that the transaction would reduce competition in the production of two kinds of rivets. 

For the quarter, Textron said aerospace revenue, including Bell helicopter and jet-engine manufacture, declined 9.8% to $755.9 million from $838.3 million, an indication of slowing government defense work.
