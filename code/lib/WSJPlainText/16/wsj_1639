Moody's Investors Service said it lowered its rating on about $75 million of this Chatsworth, Calif., concern's convertible subordinated debentures, due 2012, to Caa from B2.
It said the reduction reflects impaired business prospects and reduced financial flexibility caused by continuing losses at the maker of Winchester disk drives. 

VALLEY National Corp. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered its rating on about $400 million of this bank holding company's senior debt to B2 from Ba3.
Moody's said it expects Valley National, of Phoenix, Ariz., to make substantial further provisions against its real-estate portfolio, and that it continues to suffer from the high cost of carrying nonperforming assets, and from high loan-loss provisions.
