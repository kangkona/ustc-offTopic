Hasbro Inc., the nation's largest toy maker, reported third-quarter earnings increased 73% from a year earlier on a 9.4% sales gain, reflecting improved margins. 

Hasbro said it had net income of $31.3 million, or 53 cents a share, up from $18.1 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier, when it took a pretax charge of $10 million after dropping development of an interactive video entertainment system.
Revenue rose to $403 million from $368.4 million. 

The company cited sales gains at its Milton Bradley and Playskool units and in its international business for the increase in revenue.
Alan G. Hassenfeld, chairman and chief executive, added that Hasbro's new line of battery-powered racing cars, called Record Breakers, and its acquisition of Cabbage Patch Kids, Scrabble and other lines from Coleco Industries Inc. puts the company "in a good position as we enter the Christmas buying season." 

For the first nine months of the year, Hasbro's net income rose 33% to $68.2 million, or $1.15 a share, from $51.3 million, or 88 cents a share, on a 3.1% increase in revenue to $992.7 million from $963 million a year earlier.
