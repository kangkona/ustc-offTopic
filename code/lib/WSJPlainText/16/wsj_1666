Pitney Bowes Inc. directors authorized the company to seek buyers for its Wheeler Group Inc. subsidiary, a direct mail marketer of office supplies. 

Pitney Bowes said the decision was based on a long-term analysis of the compatibility of Wheeler Group's marketing business with other Pitney Bowes operations.
Pitney Bowes acquired the core of what evolved into Wheeler Group in 1979 by buying Dictaphone Corp. 

A spokeswoman wouldn't comment on whether the company had talked with any potential buyers for the New Hartford, Conn., unit, which had 1988 sales of about $75 million.
She said Wheeler Group was profitable but wouldn't give figures. 

The spokeswoman said the company doesn't have a timetable for the sale, adding that the board's decision just starts the search for a buyer. 

Separately, Pitney Bowes said third-quarter net income gained 15% to $62 million, or 78 cents a share, from $54 million, or 68 cents a share, a year ago.
Revenue grew 13% to $734.8 million from $650.9 million. 

The company said the growth was led by its major operations, particularly mailing, shipping, dictating and facsimile businesses.
