Ashland Oil Inc. said it will take after-tax charges of $78 million, or $1.40 a share, in its fiscal fourth quarter, ended Sept. 30. 

Because of the charge, Ashland expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter and "significantly lower results" for fiscal 1989. 

The oil refiner said it will report fiscal fourth quarter and 1989 results next week. 

The company earned $66 million, or $1.19 a share, on revenue of $2.1 billion in the year-ago fourth quarter.
For fiscal 1988, Ashland had net of $224 million, or $4.01 a share, on revenue of $7.8 billion.
Both revenue figures exclude excise taxes. 

The charges consist of: a $25 million after-tax charge to cover cost overruns in Ashland's Riley Consolidated subsidiary; a previously announced $38 million after-tax charge resulting from a $325 million settlement with National Iranian Oil Co. and a $15 million after-tax charge from the previously announced sale of its Ashland Technology Corp. subsidiary.
Ashland expects that sale to be complete next year. 

The charge for the Riley subsidiary is for expected costs to correct problems with certain bed boilers built for utilities.
The charge will be added to $20 million in reserves established a year ago to cover the cost overruns.
