Directors of state-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro approved a two-step capital-boosting transaction and a change in the bank's rules that will help it operate more like a private-sector institution. 

Until now, BNL's top managers and its directors have been appointed by a Treasury decree.
But under the bank's proposed statutes, an assembly of shareholders must approve board members.
The bank's chairman and director general, who also sit on the board, still would be appointed by the Treasury. 

BNL, which is controlled by the Italian Treasury, was rocked by the disclosure last month that its Atlanta branch extended more than $3 billion in unauthorized credits to Iraq.
The ensuing scandal, in which the bank's management resigned, has helped renew calls for privatization, or at least an overhaul, of Italy's banking system, which is about 80% state-controlled. 

In a related move, the bank also proposed that board representation be linked more closely to the bank's new shareholding structure.
BNL called a shareholders' assembly meeting in December to vote on the proposals. 

BNL has about 75,000 nonvoting shares that are listed on the Milan Stock Exchange.
The shares were suspended from trading following disclosure of the Atlanta scandal; Consob, the stock exchange regulatory body, reportedly will decide soon whether to end the trading suspension.
