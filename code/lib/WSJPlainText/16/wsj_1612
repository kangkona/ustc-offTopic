Banc One Corp. said it agreed in principle to buy five branch offices from Trustcorp Inc., Toledo, Ohio, following the planned merger of Trustcorp into Society Corp., Cleveland. 

The five offices in Erie and Ottawa counties in northern Ohio have total assets of about $88 million, Banc One said.
The purchase price will be established after Banc One has an opportunity to study the quality of the assets, Banc One said. 

Society Corp. already has branches in the area, and selling the Trustcorp offices could avoid a problem with regulators over excessive concentration of banking in the two counties after the merger of Trustcorp into Society, according to industry sources.
The merger is scheduled to take place in the 1990 first quarter.
