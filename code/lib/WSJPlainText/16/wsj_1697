Mercury Savings & Loan Association said it retained Merrill Lynch Capital Markets as its lead investment banker to advise it regarding a possible sale or other combination of the Huntington Beach, Calif., thrift. 

Mercury, which has assets of more than $2 billion and 24 branches in California, said the action to improve its regulatory capital position is related directly to new capital requirements mandated by recently adopted federal legislation.
Mercury also said it extended its two-year advisory relationship with Montgomery Securities of San Francisco. 

Mercury's stock closed yesterday at $4.875, unchanged in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
