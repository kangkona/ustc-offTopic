Hit by higher costs and lower sales, Caterpillar Inc. said third-quarter earnings tumbled 43% and full-year earnings will trail last year's results. 

The construction equipment maker said third-quarter profit fell to $108 million, or $1.07 a share, from $190 million, or $1.87 a share, a year earlier.
Sales dropped 6% to $2.58 billion from $2.74 billion, reflecting eight fewer business days in the latest quarter. 

The company, which is in a costly modernization program, said earnings were hurt by higher start-up and new program costs, increased costs of materials, higher wages and an $11 million provision for bad debts in Latin America. 

In announcing a 1989 capital spending plan of $950 million early this year, Caterpillar said full-year earnings would be flat compared with last year's $616 million, or $6.07 a share.
But yesterday, the company said this year's profit will be lower.
It didn't say by how much. 

Suffering from a downturn in heavy truck production that cut orders for its engines, Caterpillar also said it will indefinitely lay off about 325 workers in the Peoria area and temporarily shut its plant in York, Pa., for two weeks in both November and December. 

For the first nine months of the year, Caterpillar said earnings fell 14% to $390 million, or $3.85 a share, from $453 million, or $4.46 a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose to $8.19 billion from $7.65 billion.
