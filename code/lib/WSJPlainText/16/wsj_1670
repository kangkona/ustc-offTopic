Mattel Inc. said third-quarter net income rose 73%, to $38 million, or 76 cents a share, from $21.9 million, or 45 cents a share, a year ago. 

Revenue rose 34% to $410 million from $306.6 million a year earlier. 

"Mattel's world-wide volume has grown 25% in a climate of relatively flat industry sales," said John W. Amerman, chairman.
He said the toy company's "prospects for a strong fourth quarter" are also good. 

Mattel attributed the jump in quarter net to strong world-wide sales of its Barbie doll, Hot Wheels cars, Disney toys and other well-known toy lines.
The company also cited retail trade and consumer demand for new products introduced this year, such as Cherry Merry Muffin and Turtle Tots. 

For the nine months, Mattel net more than doubled to $58.9 million, or $1.19 a share, from $25.4 million, or 53 cents a share, a year ago.
Revenue rose 25%, to $877.6 million, from $702.4 million. 

Mattel said the company's sale of rights to land and buildings at its Hawthorne, Calif., headquarters resulted in a $13 million charge to third-quarter operating profit.
The charge didn't affect net for the quarter as it was offset by tax benefits. 

Mattel has purchased a new headquarters building in El Segundo, Calif., which it will occupy by the end of next year.
