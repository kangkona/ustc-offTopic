Gillette Co. elected Warren E. Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., to its board, increasing the number of directors to 12 from 11. 

Berkshire Hathaway earlier this year bought $600 million of preferred stock in Gillette that is convertible into an 11% stake, and Gillette said at the time that Mr. Buffett would be added to the board. 

Separately, Gillette said its third-quarter earnings rose 2% to $65.2 million, or 57 cents a share, from $63.9 million, or 57 cents a share, in the year-earlier period; per-share earnings remained flat despite an increase in net income in part because the company paid a $10.4 million dividend on the new preferred stock in the period.
Sales rose 9% to $921.6 million from $845.7 million, with sales of the company's international/diversified operations "well above" the year earlier-period. 

For the nine months, Gillette's net income declined 1% to $205.3 million, or $2.02 a share, from $207 million, or $1.82 a share, in the 1988 period.
Sales rose 6% to $2.77 billion from $2.61 billion. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the company closed yesterday at $45.50 a share, up 25 cents.
