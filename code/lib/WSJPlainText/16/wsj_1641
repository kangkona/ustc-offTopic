The University of Toronto stepped deeper into the contest for Connaught BioSciences Inc. by reaching an unusual agreement with Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and Chiron Corp. 

The University said the two companies agreed to spend 25 million Canadian dollars ($21.3 million) over 10 years on research at Canadian universities if they are successful in acquiring the vaccine maker.
It said $10 million would go to the University of Toronto. 

Ciba-Geigy and Chiron have made a joint bid of C$866 million for Connaught, and Institut Merieux S.A. of France has made a rival bid of C$942 million.
The University is seeking an injunction against the Merieux bid, arguing that Connaught's predecessor company agreed in 1972 that Connaught's ownership wouldn't be transferred to foreigners. 

The university implied that it would drop its opposition to foreign ownership if Ciba-Geigy and Chiron are successful with their lower bid.
It said the new agreement would "replace" the old one that forms the basis of its suit against the Merieux takeover. "Notwithstanding foreign ownership of Connaught, this accord would enhance research and development in Canada," said James Keffer, the university's vice president of research. 

Ciba-Geigy is a Swiss pharmaceutical company and Chiron is based in Emeryville, Calif. 

In a statement, Jacques-Francois Martin, director general of Merieux, said the French company is still determined to acquire Connaught.
While he didn't comment directly on the pact between Ciba-Geigy and the university, he said Merieux can transfer new products and technologies to Connaught more rapidly than other companies "not currently producing and marketing vaccines {who} can only promise this for some . . . years in the future." 

In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Connaught closed at $28.625, up $1.25.
