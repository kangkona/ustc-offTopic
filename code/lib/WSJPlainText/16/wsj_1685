Missouri farmer Blake Hurst writing in the fall issue of the Heritage Foundation's Policy Review about the proposed location of a hazardous-waste incinerator in his county: 

Of course I'd rather have a computer software firm in my backyard than a hazardous waste incinerator.
But I'd also rather live next door to an incinerator than to some of the hog farms I've seen (and smelt) in these parts.
An incinerator is also probably better than having nobody next door -- on our farm there are four unoccupied houses.
On my four-mile drive to farm headquarters each morning, I drive by another four empty houses.
A community of abandoned farmsteads, failing businesses, and crumbling roads and bridges is hardly a desirable one. . . . The loss of 40 jobs by a depressed county in rural Missouri is hardly of national importance except for this: If the most environmentally safe way of dealing with a national problem cannot be built in Atchinson County, what hope have we for dealing with the wastes our economy produces?
After all, farmers here work with "hazardous" chemicals every day, many of them the same chemicals that would have been destroyed in the incinerator.
We know they are dangerous, but if handled with care, their benefits far outweigh any risk to the environment.
