Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara said it rescheduled to Nov. 29 a special shareholder meeting to vote on a $75 million stock-for-debt exchange. 

The meeting had been scheduled for Nov. 10 but the company delayed the meeting to allow time for the Securities and Exchange Commission to review the proposal. 

As part of a restructuring announced earlier this year, the company proposed in August to exchange 168 newly issued common shares for each $1,000 face value of debt.
However, that figure could be revised, Financial Corp. said.
Currently, the company has about six million common shares outstanding.
If all the debt was converted, about 13 million new shares would be issued. 

In composite trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Financial Corp. closed at $1.125, unchanged. 

The debt consists of $50 million of 13 3/8% subordinated notes due 1998, and $25 million of 9% convertible subordinated debentures due 2012. 

Financial Corp. also is proposing to exchange each of its 130,000 outstanding shares of cumulative convertible preferred series A stock for two shares of common.
