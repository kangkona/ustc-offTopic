Switzerland's wholesale price index increased 0.3% in September from August, and was up 3.9% from a year ago, marking the first time this year that the index has fallen below 4% on a year-to-year basis, the government reported. 

The government attributed the 0.3% month-to-month rise in the index largely to higher energy prices. 

In August, the index was up 0.2% from the previous month, and was up 4.5% on a year-to-year basis. 

The wholesale price index, based on 1963 as 100, was 180.9 in September.
