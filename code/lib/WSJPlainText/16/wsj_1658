Holiday Corp. said net income jumped 89%, partly on the strength of record operating income in its gaming division. 

Separately, the hotel and gambling giant said it was proceeding with plans to make a tender offer and solicit consents with respect to approximately $1.4 billion of its publicly traded debt. 

That debt is part of the $2.1 billion of Holiday debt that Bass PLC of Britain said it would retire or assume when it agreed to buy the Holiday Inn business in August. 

Holiday said third-quarter earnings rose to $39.8 million, or $1.53 a share, from $21 million, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier.
Results for the quarter included $19.2 million in pretax gains from property transactions, including the sale of one Embassy Suites hotel, and $3.5 million of nonrecurring costs associated with the acquisition of the Holiday Inn business by Bass. 

Holiday said operating income related to gaming increased 4.5% to a record $61.4 million from $58.8 million a year earlier.
The jump reflected record results in Las Vegas, Nev., and Atlantic City, N.J., as well as a full quarter's results from Harrah's Del Rio in Laughlin, Nev. 

Third-quarter revenue rose 2.7% to $433.5 million from $422.1 million. 

For the nine months, earnings fell 2.9% to $99.1 million, or $3.86 a share, from $102.1 million, or $4.10 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue dropped 1.6% to $1.21 billion from $1.23 billion. 

The tender offer and consent solicitation will be made to debtholders in December.
In effect, Holiday is asking holders for permission for Bass to buy their debt. 

Holiday said Salomon Brothers Inc. has been retained to act as the dealer-manager and financial adviser in connection with the offer and solicitation.
The debt issues involved and the proposed consent fees and cash tender offer prices (expressed per $1,000 of principal amount) are as follows: 10 1/2% senior notes due 1994 at 101%; 11% subordinated debt due 1999 at 102%; 9 3/8% notes due 1993 at 100%; and 8 3/8% notes due 1996 at 95.25%. 

Holiday said its 15% notes due 1992 also will be included in the tender offer and consent solicitation at a price to be determined by Holiday prior to the commencement of the offer.
Holiday said it intends to set the price to give noteholders approximately an 8.5% yield to the call date of Aug. 15,
