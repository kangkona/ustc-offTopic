The earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay area isn't likely to result in wholesale downgrading of bond ratings, officials at the two major rating agencies said. 

Standard & Poor's Corp. is reviewing debt issued by 12 California counties, and "there are potential isolated problems," said Hyman Grossman, a managing director.
The agency is preparing a report, to be issued today, on the earthquake's impact on the property- and casualty-insurance industry. 

The only securities so far to be singled out are those issued by Bay View Federal Savings & Loan.
Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it is reviewing, with an eye toward a possible downgrade, the ratings on Bay View Federal bonds, long-term deposits and the preferred-stock rating of its parent company, Bay View Capital Corp. 

As for property and casualty insurers, Moody's said "preliminary estimates suggest that losses should not have a significant impact on most insurers' financial condition," but it "raises concerns about potentially substantial risks" longer-term. 

"Losses from the earthquake are expected to be of similar magnitude to those of Hurricane Hugo," according to Moody's.
