Short interest on the New York Stock Exchange declined for the second consecutive month, this time 4.2%, while the American Stock Exchange reported its third consecutive record month of short interest. 

The Big Board reported that short interest dropped to 523,920,214 shares as of Oct. 13 from 547,347,585 shares in mid-September.
Amex short interest climbed 3% to 53,496,665 shares from 51,911,566 shares. 

For the year-earlier month, the Big Board reported 461,539,056 shares, indicating a 13.5% year-to-year rise, while the Amex reported 36,015,194 shares, a 48% leap. 

Amex short interest has been heading upward since mid-December, with increases in each month since then except at mid-July. 

Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, betting that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender. 

Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet been purchased for return to lenders.
Although a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's price will decline, some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be bought back. 

Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitraging.
The figures occasionally include incomplete transactions in restricted stock. 

The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board short interest ratio slipped to 3.36 from last month's 3.38.
The ratio is the number of trading days, at the exchange's average trading volume, that would be required to convert the total short interest position. 

Some analysts suggest, however, that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because options and other products can be used to hedge short positions. 

Varity Corp. led the Big Board list of largest short volumes with 12,822,563 shares.
