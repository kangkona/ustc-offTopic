I was amused to read your recent news stories on the banking industry's reserve additions and concomitant threats to cease making new loans to less-developed countries.
If the whole story were told, it would read something like this: 

-- During the 1970s the commercial banks lured the country loan business away from the bond markets where the discipline of a prospectus and "Use of Proceeds" confirmation allowed lenders to audit expenditures of old loans before new loans were made. 

-- The reward for that reckless lending was high reported earnings (and management bonuses); the price, a sea of bad loans. 

-- For the past several years, the banks, lacking a private navy to enforce their interests, have been pressuring the U.S. Treasury to underwrite their bad LDC credits. 

-- The Treasury wisely has refused, but has concluded that indirect credit support through various multinational agencies should be made available for a price: either debt reduction or debt-service reduction or new loans (the Brady Plan). 

-- The banks will threaten not to make further loans, but in truth, lacking the capital to write off their mistakes or to build a navy, they have no alternative but to go along.
