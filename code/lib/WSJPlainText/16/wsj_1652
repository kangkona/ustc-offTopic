Amoco Corp. said third-quarter net income plunged 39% to $336 million, or 65 cents a share, as gasoline refining and marketing profits lagged substantially behind last year's record level. 

A charge of $80 million related to projected environmental costs in its refining and marketing operations further depressed results.
A spokesman said Amoco completed an environmental analysis last quarter but that no single clean-up project was responsible. 

In the 1988 third quarter, the Chicago-based oil company earned $552 million, or $1.07 a share.
Revenue in the latest quarter rose 12% to $6.6 billion from $5.91 billion.
Aside from the special charge, Amoco's results were in line with Wall Street estimates.
The company's stock ended at $48.375, up 25 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

Amoco is the first major oil company to report third-quarter results.
Analysts expect others to show a similar pattern.
Generally in the quarter, overproduction of gasoline and higher crude oil prices pressured profitability.
The industry's chemical profits also declined because excess capacity has depressed prices.
Gasoline margins may rebound this quarter, some industry officials say, but they believe chemical margins could worsen. 

American Petrofina Inc., a Dallas-based integrated oil company, yesterday said its third-quarter earnings declined by more than half.
Fina blamed lower chemical prices, reduced gasoline margins and refinery maintenance shutdowns.
It said net income dropped to $15.1 million, or 98 cents a share, from $35.2 million, or $2.66 a share.
Sales rose 2.2% to $711.9 million from $696.1 million. 

Amoco's refining and marketing profit in the quarter fell to $134 million from $319 million.
Chemical earnings declined by one-third to $120 million last year's robust levels. 

Amoco's domestic oil and natural gas operations recorded a profit of $104 million in the quarter compared with a loss of $5 million, "primarily on the strength of higher crude oil prices," said Chairman Richard M. Morrow.
Amoco also sharply boosted natural-gas output, part of it from properties acquired from Tenneco Inc. last year. 

But foreign exploration and production earnings fell sharply, to $12 million from $95 million.
Higher oil prices weren't enough to offset a roughly $20 million charge related to a 10% reduction in Amoco's Canadian work force as well as increased exploration expenses. 

For the nine months, Amoco said that net income fell to $1.29 billion from $1.69 billion but if unusual items are excluded, operations produced essentially flat results.
Revenue rose 12% to $19.93 billion from $17.73 billion.
