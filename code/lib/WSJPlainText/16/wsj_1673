The Federal Trade Commission ruled that five major title-insurance companies illegally fixed prices for title search-and-examination services by participating in joint "rating bureaus" in six states. 

The FTC ordered the companies not to use rating bureaus in those six states.
The commission order named the following companies: Ticor Title Insurance Co. of California, a unit of Los Angeles-based Ticor; Chicago Title Insurance Co. and Safeco Title Insurance Co., units of Chicago Title & Trust Co.; Lawyers Title Insurance Corp., a unit of Richmond, Va.-based Universal Corp.; and Stewart Title Guaranty Co., a unit of Houston-based Stewart Information Services Corp. Chicago Title & Trust acquired Safeco in 1987 and changed the unit's name to Security Union Title Insurance Co. 

The FTC ruled that the companies violated federal antitrust law by fixing rates in the following states: New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Wisconsin, Arizona and Montana.
The FTC first issued an administrative complaint in the case in 1985. 

John Christie, a lawyer here for the two Chicago Title & Trust units accused the FTC of "second-guessing" state-level regulations, with which, he said, his clients had complied. "I expect all the companies to appeal," he added. 

A lawyer for Lawyers Title said that, because the named companies no longer use the type of cooperative rating bureaus attacked by the FTC, the commission's order won't have much practical impact.
Officials for the other named companies didn't return telephone calls seeking comment.
