The government will try to sell all the real estate managed by the Federal Asset Disposition Association in one fell swoop, said William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 

The FADA real-estate package, with an asking price of $428 million, is comprised of 150 properties in Texas, California, Colorado, Arizona and Florida.
It includes apartments, shopping centers, office buildings and undeveloped land. 

Mr. Seidman is chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., established to sell or merge the nation's hundreds of insolvent savings-and-loan associations.
The RTC, created by this year's S&L bailout legislation, is trying to sell FADA's network of offices separately.
FADA, which holds problem assets of thrifts that were closed before the bailout legislation was enacted, is being liquidated. 

The properties held by FADA won't be sold piecemeal, Mr. Seidman said in a speech before Southern Methodist University Business School in Dallas. "You need to buy the entire lot," Mr. Seidman said, "so get out your checkbooks."
