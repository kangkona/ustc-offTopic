Bell Atlantic Corp. and Southern New England Telecommunications posted strong profit gains for the third quarter, while Nynex Corp., Pacific Telesis Group and U S West Inc. reported earnings declines for the period. 

Rate settlements in Minnesota and Colorado depressed U S West's third-quarter profit.
Denver-based U S West said net income dropped 8.9%, noting that the year-ago quarter included the sale of a building by its BetaWest Properties unit. 

Revenue dropped 4.3% to $2.3 billion from $2.4 billion, reflecting declines in its consumer-telephone sector, long-distance carrier business and diversified division.
Revenue from business-telephone operations grew 3.3% to $618.9 million from $599.4 million a year ago. 

New telephone lines posted healthy growth.
Overall they increased 2.8% to 12.1 million, putting U S West over the 12 million mark for the first time.
Business lines increased 3.7% to 3.3 million. 

"On a truly comparable basis, we've seen modest earnings growth this year from the operations of our company," said Jack MacAllister, chairman and chief executive officer. "The major negative factor was the cumulative impact of regulatory activity over the past two years." 

He said the company expects to be "on target" with analysts' projections by year end but conceded that the fourth quarter represents "a significant challenge." 

Expenses in the quarter dropped 11.2% to $664.3 million from $747.7 million a year ago.
Yesterday, U S West shares rose 75 cents to close at $71.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic said net rose 6.5%, aided by strong growth in the network-services business and an increase in the number of new telephone lines. 

Revenue jumped 5.6% to $2.9 billion from $2.8 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Revenue from financial and real-estate services jumped 23% to $177.4 million from $144.1 million a year ago.
Network-access revenue from long-distance telephone companies increased 6.4% to $618.6 million. 

Bell Atlantic added 148,000 new telephone lines in the quarter for a total of 16.9 million. 

The company said per-share earnings were slightly reduced by the sale of 4.1 million shares of treasury stock to the company's newly formed Employee Stock Ownership Plans. 

In composite trading on the Big Board, Bell Atlantic closed at $100.625, up $1.50 a share. 

At Nynex, net slumped 14.8%, primarily because of a continuing strike by 60,000 employees, lower-than-expected profit at its New York Telephone unit and significantly higher taxes and costs. 

State and local taxes increased to $131.3 million from $99.1 million a year ago.
Nynex said expenses rose 4.5% to $2.73 billion from $2.61 billion, a $119 million increase.
Most of the higher costs were associated with acquisitions and growth in nonregulated business units, it added. 

"Our net income isn't where we would want it to be at this point," said William C. Ferguson, chairman and chief executive officer. "This deviation from our past growth patterns is caused largely by lower earnings at New York Telephone." 

Mr. Ferguson said a continued softness in New York City area's economy and increased competition, particularly in the private-line market, took a heavy toll on earnings. 

The three-month-old strike at Nynex seriously hurt the installation of new telephone lines in the quarter.
Nynex said access lines in service at the end of the quarter were off 18,000 from the previous quarter, which reported an increase of 160,000 new access lines. 

Revenue rose to $3.31 billion from $3.18 billion, mostly from acquisition of AGS Computers and robust non-regulated businesses. 

In Big Board composite trading yesterday, Nynex common closed at $81.125, up $1.625. 

Southern New England Telecommunications, which bolstered its marketing efforts for telephone and non-telephone subsidiaries, reported that net increased 8.1%. 

Walter H. Monteith Jr., SNET chairman and chief executive officer, said: "Innovative marketing of our products and services contributed to increase revenue." 

Revenue and sales increased 7.5% to $423.9 million from $394.4 million a year earlier.
Yellow pages advertising sales rose 11.8% to $41.2 million. 

Cost and expenses for the quarter, excluding interest, increased 6.1% to $333.3 million from $314 million the year before. 

SNET common rose $1.25 to $85.50 a share yesterday in composite trading on the Big Board. 

San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis said net declined 12.6%, primarily because of regulatory action.
Revenue was about flat at $2.4 billion. 

Revenue was reduced $33 million by three extraordinary items: a California Public Utilities Commission refund for an American Telephone & Telegraph Co. billing adjustment; a provision for productivity sharing to be paid to customers in 1990 and a one-time accrual for a toll settlement with long-distance telephone companies. 

Excluding the one-time charges, the company would have posted earnings of $298 million, or 73 cents a share.
The company also was hurt by a $289 million rate reduction that went into effect in 1989. 

"This is a good quarter for us in terms of our business fundamentals," said Sam Ginn, chairman and chief executive officer.
Pacific Telesis said new telephone lines increased 4.5% for a total of about $13.5 million for the quarter; toll calls increased 9.6% to 807 million and minutes of telephone usage increased to 9.9 billion. 

In Big Board composite trading yesterday, Pacific Telesis common closed at $45.50, up 87.5 cents.
