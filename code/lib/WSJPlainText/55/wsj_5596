Hyde Athletic Industries Inc. said Silvershoe Acquisition Corp. offered to terminate an agreement to acquire Hyde at $8.50 a share. 

The offer is subject to the understanding that the termination won't prejudice any rights and claims the parties may have with respect to the merger agreement, said Hyde, which is based in Peabody, Mass.
Leonard Fisher, Hyde's chairman and chief executive, said the offer will be presented to the company's board for consideration. 

Hyde previously said that Silvershoe's bank financing commitment appeared to fall short of the amount needed to close the transaction, and a Hyde spokesman said yesterday that Hyde believes that continues to be the case. 

Hyde, maker of Saucony, PF Flyer and other athletic shoes, had 2.8 million shares outstanding on June 30. 

In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Hyde closed at $5.375, down 25 cents.
