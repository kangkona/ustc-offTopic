American Express Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., saying they plan to enter the growing cellular market in Europe, applied for radio telephone licenses in West Germany and the United Kingdom. 

A spokesman for Shearson said market surveys estimate that European subscribers to mobile communications services are expected to reach 16 million by the year 2000, up from 1.8 million today.
The spokesman said Shearson hopes to apply for licenses in other European countries as well. 

A number of groups are competing for a limited number of licenses in various European countries. 

In the application for the German license, Shearson joined with seven other companies to form a consortium named MobiTel.
Other members of MobiTel include four German firms as well as Cellular Communications Inc., Ing.
C. Olivetti S.p.
A. and Bell Canada Enterprises, a subsidiary BCE Inc. 

Nine other consortiums are competing for the license, which is expected to be awarded in December. 

Late last year, Shearson joined with Olivetti and Cellular Communications and formed Eurocell Communications N.V. to apply for new cellular telephone systems in Europe.
Eurocell then joined seven other companies and formed Intouch, a consortium that has applied for a license to operate such systems in the U.K. 

Intouch is one of eight applicants for three possible licenses expected to be awarded by the end of the year.
Other members of Intouch include Contel Cellular Inc., a unit of Contel Corp., Gooding Investments and Murray International. 

The Shearson spokesman said that if the consortium received the licenses, Shearson would commit its own capital to a start-up company.
Consortium members would contribute additional funding and the necessary technology in the new venture.
