The International Civil Aviation Organization said world airline scheduled passenger traffic will double and freight traffic more than double by the year 2000, matching the growth rate of the past ten years. 

ICAO said scheduled passenger traffic is expected to grow at an average rate of 6% annually from 1988 to 2000, compared with 6.1% annually from 1978 to 1988.
ICAO said scheduled freight traffic is expected to grow at an average rate of 7% annually from 1988 to 2000 compared with 7.5% annually from 1978 to 1988.
ICAO didn't provide a forecast for non-scheduled, or charter-type, air traffic. 

ICAO, based in Montreal, is the multilateral agency that governs international air transportation and related matters.
The traffic forecast was prepared for ICAO's 27th assembly session, which opened yesterday. 

The 161 ICAO member states will discuss the traffic forecast, airport congestion, airport and airline security, and drug smuggling during the three-week session. 

ICAO said scheduled passenger traffic was 580.32 billion passenger-miles in 1978, 1,051.52 billion passenger-miles in 1988 and is expected to reach 2,139 billion passenger-miles in 2000.
A passenger-mile is one paying passenger flown one mile. 

ICAO said growth in scheduled passenger and freight traffic will continue to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region, as it was in the 1978-1988 period.
The agency said that by the year 2000 scheduled passenger traffic on airlines based in the Asia-Pacific region will account for 26% of world traffic compared with 18% last year, while the region's airlines will hold a 40% share of scheduled world-freight traffic, surpassing European and North American carriers.
