Moody's Investors Service Inc. confirmed the ratings on $8.8 billion of securities issued by Manufacturers Hanover Corp. as well as the bank holding company's subsidiaries. 

Moody's hadn't been formally reviewing the ratings.
The credit-rating company said, however, that it was prompted to act on the ratings by Manufacturers' plan to recapitalize, including the sale of 4.9% of the parent and 60% of its CIT Group finance subsidiary to Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. of Japan. 

Manufacturers also plans to sell as much as $500 million of equity, and it will boost its reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries. 

Selling the stakes in the parent and CIT "will improve the corporation's financial position," Moody's said.
But it added that when it assigned the current ratings in February 1988, it expected Manufacturers eventually would take this sort of action. 

Also, Manufacturers "may have to further increase its {less-developed-country} reserve . . . which could renew pressure" on its regulatory capital, Moody's said.
The bank's "key-financial indices" -- core earnings, liquidity and asset quality" -- have continued to improve, a trend evident for some time," Moody's said. 

Ratings confirmed include the parent's Baa-3 senior debt, Ba-2 subordinated debt, including Eurobonds, Ba-3 preferred stock and prime-3 commercial paper. 

The single-A-1 senior debt, single-A-2 subordinated debt, and prime-1 short-term debt of CIT Group Holdings remain under a review for possible upgrade that Moody's announced Sept. 13.
