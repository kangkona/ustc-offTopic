American Greetings Corp. reported that profit more than doubled for the fiscal second quarter, as the Cleveland company continues to benefit from last year's restructuring. 

Net in the Aug. 31 quarter rose to $5 million, or 16 cents a share, from $2.3 million, or eight cents a share. 

American Greetings reported its highest second-quarter revenue ever.
Revenue rose 6.5% to $282.7 million from $265.4 million. 

The greeting card company attributed its improved performance to last year's cost-savings measures, including the sale or closing of several subsidiaries.
The company also said its "Couples" card line, introduced in July, had brisk sales. 

American Greetings earned $22.5 million for the first half, or 70 cents a share, on revenue of $576.4 million.
For the like period last year, the company earned $17.8 million, or 56 cents a share, on revenue of $568.6 million. 

Its shares closed yesterday at $30.25, up 12.5 cents, in national over-the-counter trading.
