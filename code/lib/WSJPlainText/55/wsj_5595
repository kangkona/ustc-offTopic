The U.S. sales arm of Honda Motor Co. is raising base prices of its redesigned 1990 Accord models by as much as 5% from a year earlier. 

Honda formally unveiled the new Accord, which is longer, roomier and more powerful than its predecessor.
The Accord accounts for nearly half of Honda's total U.S. sales and is now poised to compete directly with Detroit's mainstream, midsized products both in size and price.
Despite the price rises, the cheapest 1990 Accord will have a base price $449 lower than the cheapest Ford Motor Co. Taurus, the best-selling midsized sedan in the country last year. 

The cheapest Accord, the DX coupe with five-speed manual transmission, will have a 1990 base price of $12,145, up 4.2% from $11,650 a year earlier.
By comparison, the preliminary price for the cheapest 1990 Ford Taurus is $12,594, up 6.9% from 1989.
General Motors Corp. 's Chevrolet Lumina Euro sedan, equipped with an engine comparable in performance to the new Accord's, starts at $14,240, up 3.4% from the car's introductory price this spring. 

Honda boosted prices most sharply on the middle of the Accord model lineup.
The 1990 Accord LX will start at $14,895, up 5% from the year-earlier price of $14,180. 

At the top of the Accord line, Honda essentially consolidated two models into one.
The new Accord EX four-door with four-speed automatic transmission, will start at $17,345.
The EX replaces the 1989 LXi version, which started at $15,920, and the 1989 Accord SEi model, which listed for $18,645 and offered such features as leather seats.
