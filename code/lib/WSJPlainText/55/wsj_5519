The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, under pressure to toughen its market oversight, fined Siegel Trading Co. $100,000 and ordered it to withdraw permanently from exchange membership for alleged fraudulent commodity-options sales practices. 

The Merc action follows a public rebuke by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in June, when the federal regulator accused the Merc of dragging its feet in investigating such practices at a certain firm, which industry lawyers identified as Siegel Trading.
The CFTC said it first brought questionable sales practices at the firm to the Merc's attention in 1985. 

Robert Benedetto, Siegel Trading compliance officer, referred calls about the Merc ruling to the company's outside attorney William Phelan, who couldn't be reached for comment. 

Siegel Trading came under regulatory fire earlier this month when the CFTC filed a complaint in Los Angeles federal court against Siegel and another commodity options trading firm, International Trading Group Ltd.
The CFTC said that since 1984 Siegel earned about $40 million in customer commissions trading commodity options, while its customers had losses of $33.6 million trading those options. 

The Merc alleged that Siegel Trading "favored its own rather than customers' best interests" by making trades in customers' accounts without their approval.
The exchange alleged that Siegel Trading accepted and transmitted customer trades without a predetermined exercise or "strike" price, and that the company then chose an exercise price that resulted in a profit for the firm rather than the customer. 

Siegel Trading agreed to the fine and withdrawal from membership without admitting or denying the exchange allegations.
The company also agreed to keep much stricter records of customer orders, including tape recording all customer solicitations for the next five years.
