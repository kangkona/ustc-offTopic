I.C.H. Corp. said it exchanged 3,398,947 rights issued to it by First Executive Corp. for 5,098,420 warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,549,210 shares of common First Executive stock.
Two warrants are required to purchase each share of common stock. 

The warrants can be exercised between Dec. 4, 1989, and Oct. 9, 1992, at a price per share equal to 150% of the average closing price of the common stock for the 30 consecutive trading days following Oct. 10, 1989, provided that the price per share is between $12.75 and $15.
First Executive stock closed unchanged yesterday at $11 in national over-the-counter trading. 

I.C.H. is an insurance holding company, and First Executive is a Los Angeles-based insurance holding company. 

Separately, First Executive said a shareholder suit was filed in state court in Los Angeles against the company, its chairman, Fred Carr, and six other officers in connection with the insurance concern's rights offering. 

The suit, filed by shareholders Kalman Finkel and Claire Hager of New York, seeks class-action status for shareholders who owned First Executive stock as of May 10, 1989, and alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty in devising the rights offering.
The suit seeks an injunction against the implementation of the plan, plus unspecified damages. 

First Executive said it will vigorously oppose the suit, which it believes is without merit.
