Farmers Group Inc. said a federal judge in Kansas denied an attempt by Sir James Goldsmith to block the Kansas Insurance Department from reviewing his unfriendly #13.4 billion ($20.8 billion) bid for B.A.T Industries PLC, parent of Farmers. 

The Kansas court is the fifth to reject Sir James's request for an injunction, after Idaho, California, Washington and Texas.
Sir James and his Hoylake Investments Ltd. filed lawsuits in federal courts in the nine states where Farmers has operations seeking to block the insurance commissions there from reviewing his offer for B.A.T, a London-based tobacco, retailing, paper and financial-services concern.
Hoylake has appealed the denials in the other states.
The request for an injunction is still pending in Illinois, Ohio, Arizona and Oregon. 

Britain's Takeover Panel last week gave Sir James more time to pursue the bid for B.A.T because of the regulatory delays in the U.S. Without the extension past the earlier Oct. 7 deadline, the bid would have been doomed. 

In an attempt to appease the U.S. regulators, Sir James last month reached an agreement for France's Axa-Midi Assurances to buy Farmers for $4.5 billion if Hoylake acquires B.A.T. 

But a group of California politicians headed by state Sen. Alfred E. Alquist blasted that proposal in a recent letter to California's insurance director, Roxani Gillespie.
The senator said in his letter that the plan would "immediately burden Farmers with $4.5 billion in debt," and he urged the commissioner to give the proposed acquisition "the most thorough possible review." The letter was co-signed by 60 members of the California state legislature. 

Pierre Barberis, deputy chairman of Axa-Midi, maintained yesterday that "There will be absolutely no 'junk' financing used in the acquisition of Farmers . . . {and} there will be no financial constraints imposed by Axa-Midi upon Farmers."
