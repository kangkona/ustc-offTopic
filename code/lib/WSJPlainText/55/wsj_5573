Cox Cable Communications agreed to buy a $15 million equity stake in Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., a video-rental concern, and also signed a letter of intent to operate 100 Blockbuster Video stores as a franchise owner by the end of 1991. 

Cox Cable, a division of closely held Cox Enterprises Inc. in Atlanta, said it agreed to buy one million shares of Blockbuster stock at $15 a share, the closing price last Friday.
The stake represents 1.4% of Blockbuster's 71.5 million shares outstanding.
Cox Cable didn't previously own any Blockbuster stock. 

A spokesman for Cox Cable said the company believes video rentals are an "explosive" market. "It's a business that we've watched for a long time," he said. 

Yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Blockbuster shares rose $1 to close at $16. 

Cox Cable said the 100 Blockbuster stores would be run as an operating unit of the company in Atlanta.
Cox Cable owns and operates 24 cable-TV systems in 17 states, serving more than 1.5 million customers.
Blockbuster operates 869 stores, 485 of which are company owned.
