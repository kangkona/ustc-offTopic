Two days of talks on steel issues ended inconclusively Tuesday, with the U.S. and Japan unable to agree on what Japan's share should be under a revamped quota agreement, Japanese government sources said. 

This session, the third round of discussions, focused on a renewal of the voluntary restraint agreement covering Japanese steel exports to the U.S. 

Sources said U.S. and Japanese officials have agreed to meet in Washington late next week for a fourth round of discussions, prior to the existing agreement's Sept. 30 expiration date. 

Under the expiring format, Japan has a 5.8% share of the 18.4% of the U.S. steel market set aside for foreign companies. 

The meetings follow President Bush's July declaration that Washington is willing to negotiate a 30-month extension of its general voluntary restraint agreement on steel with trading partners. 

Sources disclosed earlier this week that participants are encountering difficulties in nailing down a new quota share for Japan against the backdrop of U.S. pressure for "structural" reforms in Japan's steel industry.
