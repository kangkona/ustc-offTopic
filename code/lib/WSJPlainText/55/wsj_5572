Cable giant Tele-Communications Inc., responding to widespread criticism among lawmakers about poor service and high fees in the deregulated cable TV industry, announced plans for a national customer service program starting next year. 

Denver-based Tele-Communications, which almost never holds news conferences, staged one in Washington yesterday with over 50 executives in attendance, to announce the 20-point program.
The company is the largest cable operator in the U.S., with direct ownership or control of systems serving close to 12 million of the nation's approximately 50 million cable homes. 

Amomng other things, Tele-Communications said it will start giving customers a money-back guarantee for cable service and products.
Last week, the company said it would begin installing advanced terminals in customer homes to allow pay-per-view and other new services.
