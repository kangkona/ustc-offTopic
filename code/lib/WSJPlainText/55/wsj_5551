Hooker Corp. agreed to sell some of its assets for 11.1 million Australian dollars (US$8.6 million), the Australian company's provisional liquidator said. 

The sale accord includes Hooker's sand-mining, quartzite-quarrying and concrete-product-making operations in the states of New South Wales and Victoria.
CSR Ltd. and Pioneer International Ltd. agreed to buy the interests effective Sept. 1, according to a statement from Peat Marwick Hungerfords. 

Hooker, a property and retail concern with U.S. interests, turned itself over to the court-appointed provisional liquidator in July because of a cash shortage.
Hooker owes Australian and international banks about A$1.6 billion.
