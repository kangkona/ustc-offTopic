The European Community Commission proposed levying anti-dumping duties against two Japanese-owned plants making dot matrix computer printers in the U.K. 

The Commission said it proposed duties of 30 European Currency Units (US$31.59) on matrix printers made by NEC Technologies Ltd. and 14 ECUs on Star Micronics Manufacturing Ltd. printers for failing to meet the EC requirement that at least 40% of components come from outside Japan. 

The Commission also cleared seven other plants under investigation. 

EC trade law requires companies that set up manufacturing within the Community to get at least 40% of their materials from outside their home countries in order to avoid anti-dumping duties. 

The EC Commission said its investigation showed that the NEC plant in Telford, U.K., was importing 68% of its materials from Japan and the Star plant was importing 98%.
The investigation was initiated after a complaint by European matrix printer manufacturers last November. 

NEC claims that less than 35% of the materials for the Telford-made printers are Japanese.
More than 50% of the printers' materials come from the EC, it says.
NEC Technologies "fails to understand why the Commission has proposed . . . a duty" when it is aware of its increased use of non-Japanese domponents, the company said in a statement. 

Star Micronics couldn't be reached for comment. 

Brother Industries Ltd., Citizen Manufacturers Ltd., Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., OKI Electric Industry Co., all in the U.K.; Fujitsu Espana SA in Spain; Seikosha (Europe) G.m.b.
H. and TEK Elektronik G.m.b.
H., both in West Germany, were all found to be using less than 60% Japanese-made materials.
