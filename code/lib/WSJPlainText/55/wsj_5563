A federal judge ruled that a former official of collapsed carpet-cleaning company ZZZZ Best Co. must pay a $899,443 penalty on civil insider-trading charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Jerry N. Polevoi pleaded guilty last year to a four-count indictment that included an insider-trading charge, and he is now in federal prison.
A similar ruling in the civil insider-trading case was issued last month against Mr. Polevoi's twin brother, Jack N. Polevoi, a former ZZZZ Best vice president who is also serving time in prison. 

Of the $899,443 payment, $224,860.75 involves repayment of money Mr. Polevoi earned from shorting ZZZZ Best stock when he knew that the company was in financial difficulties and that its chairman, Barry Minkow, was thinking of resigning.
Mr. Minkow was sentenced in March to 25 years in prison and ordered to pay $26 million in restitution for his role in the ZZZZ Best fraud.
The rest of the fine against Mr. Polevoi is a triple penalty to be paid to the government.
