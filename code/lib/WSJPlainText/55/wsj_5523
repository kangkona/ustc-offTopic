.START 

Three Stratus Computer Inc. officials sold shares last month, before the stock went into a tailspin this week on disappointing earnings news, Securities and Exchange Commission filings show. 

Among those selling was Robert Freiburghouse, senior vice president of engineering.
He sold 27% of his stake at the time, 28,938 shares, for $846,000 on Aug. 1, the SEC filings show.
The transaction, which came on top of other sizable sales in March and May, boosted Mr. Freiburghouse's total sales this year to 98,938 shares, or 91% of his Stratus holdings at the beginning of the year, according to the filings. 

Two other Stratus officials, Robert Donahue, the company's controller, and William Thompson, a senior vice president, also sold shares in August.
All three executives sold at $29.25 to $34 a share.
Yesterday, this Marlboro, Mass., maker of minicomputer systems closed at $25.75, down 25 cents, in over-the-counter trading. 

SEC filings show that, since May, an additional seven insiders have sold between 260 and 5,000 shares each, all at prices above the current level. 

Messrs.
Freiburghouse, Donahue and Thompson couldn't be reached to comment.
But Michael McConnell, the company's assistant treasurer, said: "When we reached a conclusion that it was unlikely that we would meet the revenue plan, right away, at that moment, we closed the window {on trading} for all officers and persons who were aware of that." 

Mr. McConnell said the company became aware Thursday that it wouldn't realize third-quarter expectations. "We made every effort to make this information public as soon as it became available to us," he added.
Stratus wouldn't confirm the SEC figures on sales by the 10 executives. 

The price of Stratus stock plummeted $7.25 Monday on more than 10 times normal volume.
The plunge followed a company statement that Stratus expected to report third-quarter net income of 35 cents to 38 cents a share, sharply below analysts' estimates of about 47 cents a share. 

James Tarantino, head of over-the-counter trading at the San Francisco brokerage firm of Hambrecht & Quist, said the earnings announcement came as a surprise to investors.
Buyers aren't coming back in force to snap up Stratus stock at these depressed levels, he said. "People figure, when there's smoke, there's fire." 

Stratus Computer "may be moving into adolescence," said Carol Muratore, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Co.
While it's too early to draw long-term conclusions from the weaker-than-expected quarter, she said Stratus has entered a size range -- between about $300 million and $500 million in annual revenue -- where growth rates can become less predictable. 

According to the SEC filings, the August sale by Mr. Thompson, the senior vice president of marketing, was 3,000 shares, representing 12% of his holdings; he received $102,000 for the shares.
SEC filings also show that Mr. Thompson sold a total of 4,413 shares in two earlier sales this year.
Mr. Donahue, the controller, sold all of his stock, 1,807 shares, for $59,179, or $32.75 a share Aug. 25, according to the filings. 

BIG BEARS SELLING: Seven Bear Stearns & Co. insiders, including the chairman and vice chairman, sold shares of the New York brokerage firm in August. 

Chairman Alan C. Greenberg sold 343,111 shares, or 10% of his stake, for $5.8 million in several sales between Aug. 14 and Aug. 31.
Mr. Greenberg said he sold his shares to pay taxes and to fund charitable contributions. 

The other insiders, he said, sold to diversify their assets. "Some are getting older, and most of us have huge percentages {of our assets} in Bear Stearns stock." 

He was joined by E. John Rosenwald Jr., vice chairman, who sold 27% of his direct holdings, or 675,000 shares.
Mr. Rosenwald, who also holds 544 shares indirectly, received $11.4 million for his shares.
He wasn't available to comment. 

Five other officials sold between 20,000 and 37,500 shares each in August at $16.38 to $17 a share. 

The sales came after two substantial stock distributions to company officials by Bear Stearns earlier this year, a spokeswoman said. 

Bear Stearns closed yesterday at $16, up 12.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

ALL THAT GLITTERS: Insiders have been selling at two gold producers, in some cases benefiting from recent upturns in prices of gold stocks. 

The strongest metals-stock selling was at American Barrick Resources Corp., a Toronto gold producer.
Two senior vice presidents, the treasurer and the chief financial officer all sold shares in August at prices near the 52-week high of $32 Canadian (US$27), SEC filings show. 

Jerry Garbutt, executive vice president and chief financial officer, said the shares sold were acquired in January by exercising options that were part of their total remuneration package. 

There has also been selling at Echo Bay Mines Ltd., an Edmonton, Alberta, gold and silver mining concern.
John Zigarlick Jr., president, sold a total of 19,500 shares Aug. 11 and Aug. 14, some at C$18.88 and the rest at C$19.00, according to SEC filings, leaving him with 45,200 shares.
According to SEC filings, Peter Clarke, senior vice president, operations, sold 10,000 shares, half his holdings, on Aug. 22. 

Neither Mr. Zigarlick nor Mr. Clarke could be reached.
Questions were referred to a spokesman at the company's Denver office, who wasn't available. 

Analysts said that prices of gold stocks have turned up a bit in the past couple of months, although the price of gold itself has been in a decline since late 1987.
American Barrick closed yesterday at $22.375, up 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, and at C$26.50 on the Toronto exchange.
Echo Bay closed yesterday at $15, down 25 cents, on the American Stock Exchange, and at C$17.75 on the Toronto exchange.
