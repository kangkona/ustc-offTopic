Rospatch Corp. said its agreement to sell the company to Atlantis Group Inc. has been terminated. 

It wasn't immediately clear why the agreement fell through.
In a statement, Rospatch, a wood furniture and defense products company, said only that the agreement had "terminated by its own terms." Miami-based Atlantis declined to comment, and Rospatch officials did not return phone calls seeking comment. 

In June the companies signed an agreement in principle calling for Atlantis to pay $23.50 a share, or about $50 million, for the 81% of Rospatch's shares it didn't already own.
The companies were to reach a definitive agreement by Sept. 5. 

Earlier in June, Rospatch agreed to be acquired by National Home Products Inc. of Buffalo, N.Y., for $23.50 a share.
But that deal also failed to materialize, Rospatch said, because National Home Products failed to prove it could raise money for the deal by a specified deadline. 

Atlantis had been trying to acquire Rospatch since last fall, when it made a $23.50-a-share offer but was rebuffed.
In January, Rospatch agreed to discuss an acquisition but called Atlantis's price "inadequate." 

Yesterday Rospatch said that it "would not rule out further acquisition discussions with Atlantis" but that it will also "examine alternative avenues to maximize shareholder value." 

As part of that effort, Rospatch said it will continue its plans to sell its defense products companies.
The company said it anticipates completing the sale of one of the companies for $3.7 million this week, and another for $13 million in cash and $3 million in stock by Oct. 31.
Last week Rospatch said it had agreed in principle to sell a third defense products unit for about $4 million in cash.
