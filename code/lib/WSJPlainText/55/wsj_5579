ConAgra Inc. said it will realign its processed-meats operations, and took a $24.8 million after-tax provision against earnings to cover anticipated costs. 

But while saying that a number of its operating companies would be affected, the Omaha, Neb., company wouldn't give details. "It's simply premature to do that," a spokesman said, indicating that the restructuring would occur in steps. 

ConAgra's processed-meats operation includes its Armour Food Co. unit, which already has undergone a restructuring. 

To cover the expected costs, ConAgra wrote down plant, property and equipment assets and took an additional charge for plant consolidations in the first quarter ended Aug. 27.
Those provisions were more than offset by a $26.9 million gain from settling litigation related to ConAgra's failed effort to acquire Holly Farms Corp. 

For the quarter, ConAgra reported net income of $49.9 million, or 60 cents a share, compared with $38.1 million, or 48 cents a share, a year ago.
Sales rose 43% to $4 billion, from $2.8 billion, mainly reflecting the consolidation of Swift Independence Packing Co. ConAgra bought the remaining 50% of that business in the quarter.
