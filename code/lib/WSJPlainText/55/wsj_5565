Skolniks Inc., Louisville, Ky., said it would take several cost-cutting moves in the face of expected lower earnings for the fourth quarter, ending July 30 and for the fiscal year. 

The chain of bagel bakeries and restaurants said it will save about $500,000 during fiscal 1990 through staff reductions and the elimination of several general and administrative expense items.
The company declined to elaborate. 

In the fourth quarter last year, Skolniks earned $65,137, or three cents a share, on revenue of $2.3 million.
For the year the company earned $600,723, or 33 cents a share, on revenue of $9.1 million. 

In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Skolniks closed at $2.125, unchanged.
