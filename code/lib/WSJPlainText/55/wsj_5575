Kollmorgen Corp. said a lessor of one of the company's facilities obtained a court order temporarily blocking Kollmorgen's acquisition by Vernitron Corp. 

Mall Drive Associates, a New York limited partnership and lessor of a Kollmorgen facility in Commack, N.Y., is seeking to stop the acquisition, claiming it will violate the lease agreement. 

Under the terms of the lease, Kollmorgen is barred from merging or restructuring if the surviving entity has a net worth less than what Kollmorgen had the immediately preceding day, according to Linda Margolin, a lawyer for Mall Drive.
In a complaint filed in a New York state court in Suffolk County, Mall Drive said Vernitron would take on substantial long-term debt to finance the acquisition. 

A spokesman for Kollmorgen, an electronics technology concern, said the claims are meritless.
Vernitron, a closely held industrial electronics firm based in Deer Park, N.Y., reached a definitive agreement in May to acquire Kollmorgen for $25 a share, or about $320 million.
The acquisition had been scheduled to close on or before Sept. 30, the Kollmorgen spokesman said. 

Kollmorgen said that Mall Drive has rejected offers by Vernitron to settle the case.
The court is scheduled to consider Mall Drive's request for a permanent injunction on Monday. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Kollmorgen shares rose $1.125 to close at $23.25.
