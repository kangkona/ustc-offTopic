Lawson Mardon Group Ltd. said it plans to restructure its packaging and printing operations in Ontario and Quebec, including a net reduction of about 9% of its Canadian work force. 

Lawson Mardon said the move will bring greater cost-efficiency, as each plant specializes in a particular line of products. 

Among the various measures, the company will move its Montreal web-printing business to an existing plant in Toronto.
The Toronto-based sheet-fed lithographic carton business will move to London, Ontario. 

A total of 185 to 190 jobs will be cut and 20 jobs created as a result of the changes, out of a total 1,800 Lawson Mardon employees throughout Canada.
