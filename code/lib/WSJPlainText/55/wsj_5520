Apple Computer Inc. said it will unveil two new computers today, its fastest Macintosh computer and its first battery-operated machine. 

The models, which have been expected for months, "basically fill out Apple's product line," said Kimball Brown, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Mr. Brown said the new machines enable Apple to match products that have been offered for some time by Compaq Computer Corp. and other makers of personal computers that aren't compatible with the Macintosh. 

Both computers will be available immediately, Apple said. 

The new Macintosh IIci, Apple's fastest computer, will be offered in several versions, ranging from $6,269 to $8,669, not including monitors and keyboards.
The IIci is similar, but faster than a IIcx model introduced by Apple six months ago. 

The new Macintosh runs some applications as much as 45% faster than the IIcx and offers better video.
The Macintosh portable comes in two versions, priced at $5,799 with one floppy disk drive and $6,499 with a 40 megabyte hard-disk drive. 

At nearly 16 pounds, Apple's new portable has been criticized for its weight, but the company is expected to sell at least 100,000 units in the fiscal year beginning Oct.
