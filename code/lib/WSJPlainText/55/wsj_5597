Avery Inc. said the closing for the sale of its Uniroyal Chemical Holding Co. unit was postponed to Oct. 13 from late September to give the buyers time to complete financing. 

The unit is being purchased by management-led UCC Investors, which has agreed in principle to pay costs caused by the delay, "including any additional taxes the company may incur," Avery said.
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is financial adviser for the buyers. 

Avery has agreed to sell the unit to the management-led group for $227.5 million cash and $12.5 million in securities.
Uniroyal Chemical Holding is the parent of Uniroyal Chemical Co., a maker of pesticides, rubber additives, and other chemical products. 

New York-based Avery has said that, after it sells Uniroyal Chemical, it expects to have $20 million to $25 million in cash and no other material assets or liabilities and plans to use the proceeds to acquire a business.
