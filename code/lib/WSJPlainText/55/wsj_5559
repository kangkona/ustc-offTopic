Vitro S.A. rejected Anchor Glass Container Corp. 's offer to provide it with confidential financial information if Vitro agreed to certain conditions. 

In a letter to Anchor's board yesterday, Vitro rejected Anchor's terms and reiterated its position that its $20-a-share offer for Anchor is "full and fair." Based on 13.9 million common shares outstanding, the offer values Anchor, a Tampa, Fla., glass container maker, at $278 million. 

Vitro, a holding company, dismissed as baseless Anchor's concern that it would use the confidential information against Anchor.
In addition, Vitro said Anchor's refusal to agree not to accept any future offer of less than $20 a share suggested that Anchor was trying to arrange a transaction in which its shareholders "would receive a substantial amount of highly speculative securities." Vitro said it suspected such a transaction would include "breakup fees" intended to penalize Vitro. 

On Monday, Anchor sent a letter saying it would provide Vitro with the confidential data it is providing to other interested parties if Vitro agreed not to acquire Anchor securities except under a tender offer for $20 or more a share. 

"We are absolutely certain that the confidential information would not in any way justify lowering the price of your offer," Anchor's letter said. 

Vitro had refused to sign a confidential agreement with Anchor because it didn't want to agree not to lower its $20-a-share offer. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Anchor closed at $19.25, unchanged.
