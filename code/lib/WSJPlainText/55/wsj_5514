The average value of investment units in 121 publicly offered commodity funds fell 7.4% in August, according to Norwood Securities, which tracks the monthly performance of the funds. 

Jay Klopfenstein, Norwood president, said performances of the funds in August were "the worst since September 1986" when the index fell 9.3%.
He said heavy losses were incurred from foreign-currency futures. 

For the first eight months of 1989, the average fund gained 0.9%.
Public commodity funds are professionally managed pools of money in which limited-partnership units, usually priced at about $1,000 each, are offered to investors.
