Nelson Holdings International Ltd. said its board proposed a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, along with a shareholder-rights plan and other changes designed to discourage "abusive" takeover attempts. 

Nelson said the proposals, which include a requirement that any merger or takeover be approved by holders of at least 80% of its common shares outstanding, will be voted on at a meeting scheduled for Oct. 27. 

The Vancouver motion-picture production and distribution concern said the rights plan and approval provision are aimed at ensuring that holders receive "full valuation" in the event of a takeover.
Nelson said it isn't aware of any plan to acquire the company. 

Separately, a Nelson spokesman said the proposed reverse stock split is designed to encourage trading among institutions that would otherwise be prohibited from trading in so-called penny stocks.
In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Nelson closed at $1, up six cents. 

Nelson has approximately 40 million common shares and 14.6 million convertible preferred shares outstanding. 

Nelson, which has most of its operations in Beverly Hills, Calif., said it may also relocate its head office to Toronto, where most of the company's directors reside.
