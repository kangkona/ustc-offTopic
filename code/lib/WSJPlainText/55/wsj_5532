Microsoft Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. may be slugging it out in court in one of the most bitter copyright battles high technology has ever seen, but that apparently doesn't mean they can't do business together. 

In one of the stranger pairings in the computer business, the two rivals unveiled an agreement yesterday to swap technology on advanced printing fonts.
Apple will design new font technology for use in future versions of Microsoft's OS/2 operating-system software.
Microsoft, Redmond, Wash., will grant Apple a license to use Microsoft printer software in future versions of Apple's LaserWriter printer. 

The move is aimed at reducing confusion in standards for fonts.
Computers currently use a dizzying array of type styles and sizes.
If Microsoft eventually succeeds in creating an industry standard with its OS/2 software, which has been slow to catch on, most desktop computers could someday have identical font capabilities. 

The alliance could be bad news for Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, Calif., which also makes font technology.
Adobe wouldn't comment, but analysts said rumors of an impending Microsoft-Apple hookup had driven Adobe's stock down in recent days.
In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Adobe shares fell 37.5 cents to close at $20.125. 

Many analysts found the news as intriguing for the Apple-Microsoft pairing as for any product it might eventually produce.
Apple, Cupertino, Calif., has sued Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard Co. in federal court here for copyright infringement, claiming their products stole the "look and feel" of Apple's Macintosh computer. 

"They make an odd couple," said Bruce Lupatkin, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist here.
