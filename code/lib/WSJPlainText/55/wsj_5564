Rogers Communications Inc., Toronto, said it plans to split both classes of its common stock, probably on a 7-to-1 basis.
It hopes to bring the price of its widely traded Class B shares down to about 15 Canadian dollars (US$12.66) each. 

The Toronto-based broadcasting and cable television concern said it will seek shareholder approval in November for the stock splits and a consequent change in dividend rights. 

Rogers' Class B, or nonvoting, shares, numbering about 13 million on a fully diluted basis, closed on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday at C$106, up C$2.
There are about eight million Class A shares on a fully diluted basis, of which Edward Rogers, president and chief executive officer, owns about 80%, a company spokesman said.
The Class A shares closed at C$127, down C$2.
