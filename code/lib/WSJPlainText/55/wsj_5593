Amcore Financial Inc. said third-quarter earnings are expected to fall about 13% to $2 million, or 40 cents a share, from $2.3 million, or 45 cents a share. 

The Rockford, Ill., bank holding company also lowered its earnings estimate for the year because growth in loan demand has outpaced the growth in lower-cost deposits, forcing the company to turn to higher-cost sources of financing. 

Carl J. Dargene, president and chief executive officer of Amcore, said it was too early to estimate the results for the year, but said it's clear that Amcore won't meet the targeted per-share earnings of between $1.90 to $1.95 a share.
In 1988, the company earned $9.1 million, or $1.77 a share. 

The earnings also will be hurt by expenses related to decisions to add staff in sales and by new-business development, as well as expenses linked to the completion of a new branch office in Rockford and the relocation of a branch in Pekin, Ill. 

Amcore stock fell 50 cents yesterday to close at $18.50 a share in national over-the-counter trading.
