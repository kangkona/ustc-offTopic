Banking regulators continued their tug-of-war over industry capital standards, as some members of a House banking subcommittee urged a tough standard. 

At a hearing yesterday, Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke defended his proposal that capital be at least 3% of assets, compared with the current 6% minimum.
He characterized a 3% minimum as the "floor" beneath the industry's new standard, in which capital requirements are based on the riskiness of a bank's loans. 

Meanwhile, William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., pushed for a 6% minimum, to better protect the FDIC from bank losses.
The FDIC, which had its first annual loss in 1988, is likely to break even this year and rebound in 1990, he said. 

Rep. Jim Leach (R.,Iowa) was among those who admonished the regulators to adopt the tougher standard, even if much of the industry would currently fail to meet it. "Don't cower to the lowest common denominator," Rep. Leach said. 

Regulators meanwhile, warned of future losses in the Northeast because of falling real-estate prices.
Mr. Clarke said that as a result of the deteriorating real-estate market in the Northeast, one large institution recently ceased making real-estate loans in that area.
