Plains Petroleum Co. said that it might have to pay a $13 million refund to KN Energy Inc. if a recent U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals opinion is upheld. 

Last week, the appeals court overturned a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order which allowed producers like Plains to renegotiate higher prices for natural gas produced from older natural gas wells.
Plains said it and other natural gas producers will appeal the decision. 

After the FERC order was issued in 1986, Plains renegotiated its price with KN, a Lakewood, Colo., energy concern.
As a result, Plains now receives about $1.74 per million British thermal unit, instead of the regulated maximum price of 58 cents per BTU. 

Plain said that if it loses the legal battle, the refund will be a "short-term setback." Under contracts it has with KN, Plains said it would receive a much higher price for gas produced from newer wells if the price paid for the older gas is reduced.
As a result of the decision, Plains said it will increase its drilling program in the Hugoton Field in Kansas, increasing its percentage of new gas produced.
