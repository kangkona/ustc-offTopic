Unemployment Doesn't 

Usually Last Too Long 

MONTHLY unemployment figures give a snapshot of the number of people looking for work, but a new Census Bureau report provides something of a moving picture of the process of being laid off and searching for a new job. 

A survey followed 21.7 million people through a 2 1/2-year period and found that few remained unemployed for long.
Between 1984 and early 1986, more than 98% of layoffs that began in 1984 had ended by the time the survey was completed. 

Of the 26.7 million periods of unemployment tracked, one-third lasted a month or less.
The average duration of layoff was 3.4 months.
White women had the shortest layoffs, averaging 3.2 months; black men had the longest, averaging 4.5 months. 

Most of the people who were out of work had just one jobless spell during the survey period.
Only 20% experienced two or more spells of unemployment.
This 20% accounted for 35% of the total number of layoffs and job searches. 

Periods of unemployment can end in two ways, when the searcher finds a job or withdraws from the labor force.
Seventy-seven percent of men who were unemployed in 1984 eventually found a job, compared with 59% of women. 

Those who withdraw from the labor force aren't necessarily discouraged; many may have reasons for giving up the job search, such as going back to school or having a child.
Those who decide to retire also are counted in this group. 

The Working Disabled 

Face a Growing Pay Gap 

SINCE 1980, earnings of disabled workers have fallen relative to those of other workers, the Census Bureau reports. 

Many people with work disabilities do, in fact, work.
In 1988, 36% of men aged 16 to 64 with a work disability were in the labor force, as were 28% of women with work disabilities.
The labor force participation rate has fallen for disabled men and risen for disabled women since 1981.
The pattern has been parallel for men and women without disabilities. 

Working men who are disabled earned an average of $15,500 in 1987, 36% less than men without a disability, who earned an average of $24,100.
Part of the gap is due to the large share of disabled men who work part time.
If the analysis is limited to people who work full time and year-round, disabled men earned 19% less than men who aren't disabled. 

But in 1980, all working disabled men earned only 23% less than working men without disabilities.
Disabled men are slightly less likely to work full time than they were then, so this may partially explain the growing earnings discrepancy. 

The earnings gap between women with and without disabilities has also increased during those years, although the full-time labor-force rate for disabled women has risen.
The share of disabled women who work full time rose to 13% in 1988 from 11% in 1981.
But disabled women's earnings were 38% lower than those of women without disabilities in 1987, compared with a 31% gap in 1980. 

Women Are Apt to Heed 

'Ounce of Prevention' 

NEARLY ONE out of every three American women takes pretty good care of herself, compared with fewer than one out of five men. 

That's the conclusion of Louis Harris & Associates, which has been surveying Americans about their health practices for Prevention magazine since 1983. 

The 1988 report card of American health shows that 24% of adults practice at least 19 out of 24 preventive health habits measured in the survey.
Those habits include not smoking, controlling weight and stress, getting regular check-ups, maintaining good nutrition, and taking basic safety precautions such as wearing seat belts.
Women are much more likely than men to do 19 or more of these things, 29% vs. 17%. 

Wisdom in health matters also comes with age and education.
Thirty percent of people aged 65 and older take at least 19 of the preventive health steps, compared with 13% of those aged 18 to 29.
Thirty-four percent of college graduates follow at least 19 of the steps, compared with 14% of high school dropouts. 

Of all adults, 55% practice 13 to 18 preventive health habits.
Twenty-two percent practice 12 or fewer. 

Odds and Ends 

SOME 36% of U.S. adults took nonprescription vitamin and mineral supplements in 1986.
A study from the National Center for Health Statistics found that 41% of women took such self-prescribed nutritional supplements, compared with 31% of men. . . . Good news for publishers: 81% of teen-agers read the newspaper at least once a week.
According to a survey by Simmons Market Research Bureau for the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, nearly half of the youngsters in the 12-to-17 age group look at the general news in daily newspapers, and 27% open to the business pages regularly.
