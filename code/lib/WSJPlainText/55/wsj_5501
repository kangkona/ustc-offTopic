Toyota Motor Corp. said fiscal-year net income climbed 11% to 346.26 billion yen ($2.37 billion), or 121.19 yen (83 cents) a share, from 310.95 billion yen, or 116.58 yen a share, the prior year. 

Japan's biggest car maker said consolidated-pretax earnings for the year ended June 30 rose 2.5% to 625.66 billion yen from 610.25 billion yen the previous year owing to vigorous demand in the domestic market, North America and Southeast Asia. 

Sales rose 11% to 8.021 trillion yen ($54.98 billion) from 7.215 trillion yen a year ago. 

For the latest fiscal year, motor-vehicle production totaled 4.1 million units, a 6.1% increase from the previous fiscal year.
Combined motor-vehicle sales, both in the domestic market and overseas, totaled approximately 4.1 million units, up 6.2% from a year ago. 

Toyota officials didn't make predictions for consolidated results for the current fiscal year, adding that accurate estimates were difficult because of uncertain currency movements.
