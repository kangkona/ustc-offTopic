Square D Co. said it expects third-quarter sales and earnings from continuing operations to be about flat with the year-earlier period. 

In the year-earlier quarter, sales from continuing operations were $402.9 million and earnings from continuing operations totaled $1.25 a share, Square D said. 

The Palatine, Ill., maker of electrical and electronic equipment said the "relatively flat" results reflect several factors.
Square D said improved performance in industrial markets will be offset by lower earnings from international operations, a lower-than-planned rate of shipments of higher-margin products and the decision to make an initial contribution of $1.4 million to the new Square D employee stock ownership plan. 

The company also said it has decided not to sell its General Semiconductor Industries subsidiary.
After reviewing several bids for the Tempe, Ariz.-based unit, which makes transient voltage suppressors and systems and high-speed power-switching transistors, Square D said it doesn't believe the bids reflect the value of the business. 

Square D shares closed yesterday at $58.875, off $1.50, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
