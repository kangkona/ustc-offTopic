The United Mine Workers union was ordered to pay $3.4 million to Pittston Co. for being violent on the picket line during its five-month strike. 

Meanwhile, mine workers have taken over a Pittston coal-preparation plant near Dante, Va., halting coal shipments from that site, one of the company's largest.
The UMW members termed the occupation a peaceful sit-in, while company officials say the union members "seized the plant." 

The $3.4 million fine, ordered by Judge Donald McGlothlin, circuit court judge in Russell County, Va., is the first fine to be paid directly to the Greenwich, Conn., company.
However, since the beginning of the strike, the UMW has been ordered to pay nearly $27 million in various fines to the state of Virginia and two southwestern counties. 

The strike follows Pittston's refusal last year to sign the UMW's industrywide labor contract. 

There were about 100 union members and supporters inside the plant, and another 750 outside.
