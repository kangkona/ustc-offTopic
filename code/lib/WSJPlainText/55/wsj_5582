A unit of Lockheed Corp., Calabasas, Calif., said the Labor Department's Occupational Health and Safety Administration proposed an additional $44,200 in civil penalties covering 230 alleged violations of safety and health standards. 

Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co., Burbank, Calif., in July agreed to pay fines to OSHA of $1.5 million, one of the largest penalty sums involved in corporate-settlement agreements with the agency.
The new penalties are the result of a subsequent inspection of facilities not covered in the earlier inspection.
The latest inspection, conducted between March 24 and Aug. 1, covered California manufacturing facilities in Burbank, Palmdale and Santa Clarita.
Lockheed has 15 working days to respond to OSHA. 

Lockheed said OSHA inspectors found most of the alleged violations were corrected, with the rest to be abated shortly. "They said that the number and type of alleged violations found are not uncommon for comprehensive reviews of large manufacturing facilities," Lockheed noted.
