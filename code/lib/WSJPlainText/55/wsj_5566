NL Industries Inc. and NL Chemicals Inc., controlled by Dallas investor Harold Simmons, raised their stake in Georgia Gulf Corp. to 9.99% of the common shares outstanding, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. 

NL Industries and NL Chemical now control 2,320,200 Georgia Gulf common shares, including 250,000 shares bought Sept. 15 and Sept. 18 for $51.875 to $52.50 a share. 

The stock was bought because of market conditions, the filing said.
Additional shares may be bought or sold, depending on market conditions and other factors, the filing said. 

Officials at Atlanta-based Georgia Gulf said they were "aware" that Mr. Simmons had increased his stake, but had no further comment. 

Last month, Mr. Simmons offered to help Georgia Gulf recapitalize or go private in a leveraged buy-out that would pay shareholders $55 a share, or about $1.38 billion.
The offer initially drove the company's stock sharply upward to $58.75 a share. 

Last week, Georgia Gulf rebuffed Mr. Simmons's offer and said it authorized its financial advisers to explore other options, such as a leveraged recapitalization, an acquisition, a joint venture, or the sale of the company. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Georgia Gulf closed at $53.25, up $1.375.
