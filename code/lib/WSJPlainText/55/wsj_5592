Craig Corp. said it will seek shareholder approval at a Nov. 10 special meeting of a newly proposed recapitalization granting holders of existing common stock considerable voting power while creating a new class of common with preferential liquidation rights. 

The company, whose principal investment is in the Stater Brothers Inc. supermarket chain, said it expects to use newly created Class A common stock to raise money for debt repayment and to accelerate the growth of its business through acquisitions. 

Craig stock climbed 75 cents a share yesterday to $42.25 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
The company said stock of record Oct. 6 will be eligible to vote at the special meeting. 

A company spokesman said the proposed changes aren't related to the accumulation of a 9% stake in the company by Yucaipa Capital Partners Limited Partnership.
Yucaipa, based in Claremont, Calif., has said among other things that it might seek control of Craig. 

A spokesman for Yucaipa said the partnership hadn't had time to study Craig's proposal but called the recapitalization appealing "on the surface" because it may enhance the stock's marketability and provide new funds for investment. 

Craig said it will ask holders to approve conversion of existing common stock into new common having 30 votes attached to each share.
That new stock hasn't been given a name, the spokesman said. 

The new Class A stock would be created having only one vote per share but certain preferential liquidation rights.
The company said it is exploring, through Bear, Stearns & Co. a possible private placement of the Class A common stock. 

Craig currently has 2.3 million common shares outstanding, which, as reported, will double Sept. 29 with payment of a 100% stock dividend.
The company spokesman said the amount of Class A stock to be authorized hasn't been decided.
