Four former Cordis Corp. officials were acquitted of federal charges related to the Miami-based company's sale of pacemakers, including conspiracy to hide pacemaker defects. 

Jurors in U.S. District Court in Miami cleared Harold Hershhenson, a former executive vice president; John Pagones, a former vice president; and Stephen Vadas and Dean Ciporkin, who had been engineers with Cordis. 

Earlier this year, Cordis, a maker of medical devices, agreed to plead guilty to felony and misdemeanor charges related to the pacemakers and to pay the government about $5.7 million in fines and other costs.
Cordis sold its pacemaker operations two years ago to Telectronics Holding Ltd. of Australia.
