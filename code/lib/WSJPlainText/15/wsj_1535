U.S. official reserve assets rose $6.05 billion in September, to $68.42 billion, the Treasury Department said. 

The gain compared with a $1.10 billion decline in reserve assets in August to $62.36 billion, the department said. 

U.S. reserve assets consist of foreign currencies, gold, special drawing rights at the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. reserve position -- its ability to draw foreign currencies -- at the IMF. 

The nation's holdings of foreign currencies increased $5.67 billion in September to $39.08 billion, while its gold reserves were virtually unchanged at $11.07 billion. 

U.S. holdings of IMF special drawing rights last month rose $247 million, to $9.49 billion, and its reserve position at the IMF increased $142 million, to $8.79 billion.
