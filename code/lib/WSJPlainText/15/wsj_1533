WEIRTON STEEL Corp. said it completed a $300 million sale of 10-year notes, the final step in the 1984 buy-out of the company from National Steel Corp.
The 10 7/8% notes were priced at 99.5% to yield 10.958% in an offering managed by Bear, Stearns & Co., Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Lazard Freres & Co., the company said.
Weirton, of Weirton, W. Va., said $60.3 million of the proceeds were used to prepay the remaining amounts on the note outstanding to National Intergroup Inc., the parent of National Steel.
Remaining proceeds were used to pay other debt and to finance the company's capital spending program.
