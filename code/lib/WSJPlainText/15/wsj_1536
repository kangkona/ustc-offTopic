Alusuisse of America Inc. plans to sell its Consolidated Aluminum Corp. subsidiary as part of its strategy to focus more on aluminum packaging in the U.S. 

Alusuisse, of New York, declined to say how much it expects to get for the unit; the company has hired First Boston Corp. to help identify bidders.
