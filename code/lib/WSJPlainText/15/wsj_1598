USACafes Limited Partnership said it completed the sale of its Bonanza restaurant franchise system to a subsidiary of Metromedia Co. for $71 million in cash. 

USACafes, which is nearly half-owned by Sam and Charles Wyly of Dallas, said it will distribute proceeds from the sale to unit holders as a liquidating dividend as soon as possible.
The Bonanza franchise system, which generates about $600 million in sales annually, represented substantially all of the partnership's assets. 

The sale of the system has been challenged in a class-action suit on behalf of unit holders filed last week in a Delaware court, USACafes said.
The company said it believes the suit is without merit.
