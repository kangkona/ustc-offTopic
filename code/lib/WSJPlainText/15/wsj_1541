Inmac Corp., a money-losing direct marketer of computer supplies and accessories, said directors suspended payment of its semiannual dividend as too great a drain on funds. 

The company paid five cents a share in April. 

The directors' action, taken Oct. 10 but announced Friday, had little or no effect on the company's stock, which stagnated at $4.75 in light over-the-counter trading. 

Inmac recently disclosed a $12.3 million write-off related to a corporate restructuring that resulted in the company's posting a $6.4 million net loss for the year ended July 29, compared with year-earlier profit of $9.7 million, or $1.02 a share.
Sales rose 12% to $249.5 million from $222.8 million. 

"The board felt that the continued payment of our semiannual dividend was inconsistent with recent operating results," said Kenneth A. Eldred, president and chief executive officer. 

"All our efforts are now focused on improving earnings to the point where we can fund additional new-country development, continue to invest in the business and reinstate the dividend," he added. 

The company offers more than 3,500 parts and supplies directly to microcomputer and minicomputer users through catalog sales.
