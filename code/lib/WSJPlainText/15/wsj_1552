Reflecting the impact of lower semiconductor prices and cuts in defense spending, Texas Instruments Inc. said third-quarter net income fell 31% and sales dropped slightly from a year earlier. 

Net fell to $65 million, or 67 cents a common share, from $93.7 million or $1.03 a share, a year ago.
Sales fell 2.5% to $1.54 billion from $1.58 billion. 

For the nine months, the electronics and defense concern had net of $255.8 million, or $2.70 a share, down 5.6% from $271 million, or $3.01 a share, in the year-ago period.
Sales were $4.66 billion, up 1.3% from $4.6 billion. 

Jerry Junkins, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said sluggish consumer-electronics sales reduced demand for semiconductors.
That, coupled with lower semiconductor prices and higher semiconductor-depreciation expense, contributed to the decline in sales and profit.
In addition, cost increases related to fixed-price defense contracts and a $10 million charge to reduce the work force of Texas Instruments' defense-electronics division also reduced net. 

However, the quarter results included $28 million in royalty income from patent licenses, up from $21 million in the year-earlier period.
The nine months include $125 million of royalty income, up from $98 million last year. 

Mr. Junkins wasn't optimistic about the short-term outlook, hinting that further workforce reductions may be needed. 

"We expect near-term sluggishness in the electronics market," he said, "and we will take ongoing cost-reduction actions as necessary to keep operations aligned with demand." Further, he said, an internal reorganization to combine several divisions into the Information Technology Group is expected to affect fourth-quarter results by an undisclosed amount.
