Whittle Communications Limited Partnership, Knoxville, Tenn., will launch its first media property targeting Hispanic women. 

"La Familia de Hoy," or "Today's Family," will debut this spring and will combine a national bimonthly magazine and TV programming. 

The television element of "La Familia" includes a series of two-minute informational features to air seven days a week on the Spanish-language Univision network, a unit of Univision Holdings Inc., which is 80%-owned by Hallmark Cards Inc. 

The features will focus on "parenting, family health and nutrition, and financial management," and will carry 30 seconds of advertising. 

The magazines, also ad-supported, will be distributed in more than 10,000 doctors' offices, clinics, and health centers in Hispanic and largely Hispanic communities.
