General Electric Co. said it signed a contract with the developers of the Ocean State Power project for the second phase of an independent $400 million power plant, which is being built in Burrillville, R.I. 

GE, along with a division of Ebasco, a subsidiary of Enserch Corp., have been building the first 250-megawatt phase of the project, which they expect to complete in late 1990.
The second portion will be completed the following year.
GE's Power Generation subsidiary will operate and maintain the plant upon its completion.
