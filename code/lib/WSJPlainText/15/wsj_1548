Contel Corp. said third-quarter net income increased 16% to $72 million, or 45 cents a share, from $62 million, or 39 cents a share, as a result of strong growth in telephone-access lines and long-distance minutes of use. 

The telecommunications company's results included a one-time gain of $4 million, or two cents a share, from the sale of Contel Credit, a leasing and financial-services subsidiary. 

Revenue rose 8.3% to $780 million from $720 million. 

Telephone-operations quarterly profit increased 9% to $84 million from $77 million, while federal-systems earnings declined 33% to $4 million from $6 million.
Information systems posted a loss of $8 million, compared with a loss of $9 million a year earlier. 

Customer-access lines increased at an annualized rate of about 4% and minutes of long-distance use rose about 12%.
A 10% gain in operating profit in the quarter was offset by a 21% boost in interest expense, reflecting higher consolidated borrowings and interest rates. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Contel closed at $33.75 a share, down .50 cents.
