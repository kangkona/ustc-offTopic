Hoechst AG said it will stop producing fertilizer in 1990 because of continued losses and a bleak outlook. 

The West German chemical concern said it will close the last remaining fertilizer plant in Oberhausen in the fall of next year. 

Hoechst said the fertilizer market faces overcapacity in Western Europe, rising imports from East bloc countries and overseas, and declining demand.
