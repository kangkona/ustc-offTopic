Daniel J. Terra, a director of First Illinois Corp., said that in August he reduced his stake in First Illinois to 26.48% of the common shares outstanding. 

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Terra said he sold 263,684 First Illinois common shares from Aug. 9 to Aug. 28 for $9.9375 to $10.5625 a share.
As a result of the sales he holds 6,727,042 shares.

He may sell more shares in the open market or in private transactions, but wouldn't rule out changing his intentions and buying shares, the filing said.
