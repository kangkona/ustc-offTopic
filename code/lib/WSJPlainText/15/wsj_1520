The Environmental Protection Agency is getting a lot out of the Superfund program.
Of the $4.4 billion spent so far on the program, 60% is going for administrative costs, management and research, the Office of Technology Assessment just reported.
Only 36 of 1,200 priority cleanup sites have been "decontaminated." Over the next 50 years, $500 billion is earmarked for the program.
At current allocations, that means EPA will be spending $300 billion on itself.
It may not be toxic, but we know where one waste dump is.
