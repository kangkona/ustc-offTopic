The board of this Ponce, Puerto Rico concern voted to suspend payment of its quarterly of 11 cents a share for the third quarter.
The third-largest thrift institution in Puerto Rico also said it expects a return to profitability in the third quarter when it reports operating results this week.
Ponce Federal said the dividend was suspended in anticipation of more stringent capital requirements under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989.
