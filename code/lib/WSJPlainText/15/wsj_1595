Initial claims for regular state unemployment benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 396,000 during the week ended Oct. 7 from 334,000 the previous week, the Labor Department said. 

The number of people receiving regular state benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 decreased to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000, or 2.2% of those covered by unemployment insurance, from 2,205,000 the previous week, when the insured unemployment rate also was 2.2%. 

Counting all state and federal benefit programs, the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 fell to 1,809,300 from 1,838,200 a week earlier.
These figures aren't seasonally adjusted. 

A Labor Department spokesman said the unusually high number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits reflects the impact of Hurricane Hugo on southern states, particularly North Carolina and South Carolina.
The figure also may reflect initial claims filed by striking Nynex Corp. workers who have become eligible for unemployment benefits, the official said.
