Lynch Corp. said its Lynch Telephone Corp. subsidiary completed the acquisition of Western New Mexico Telephone Co. for $20 million plus assumption of $24 million of debt. 

Western New Mexico Telephone, Silver City, had net income of $1.9 million on revenue of about $10 million last year.
It is an independent phone company with a service area of 15,000 square miles in southwest New Mexico.
It is also a partner in the wireline cellular franchise covering most of western New Mexico. 

The transaction represents Lynch's entry into the telephone business.
The company, which has interests in television, trucking services, and glass-making and food-processing equipment, said it plans to make other acquisitions in the telephone industry.
