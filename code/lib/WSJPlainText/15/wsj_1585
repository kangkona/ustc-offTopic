As the sponsor of the "Older Americans Freedom to Work Act," which would repeal the Social Security earnings limit for people aged 65 and older, I applaud your strong endorsement to repeal this Depression-era fossil. 

For every dollar earned over $8,880, Social Security recipients lose 50 cents of their Social Security benefits; it's like a 50% marginal tax.
But the compounded effects of "seniors only" taxes result in truly catastrophic marginal tax rates. 

Imagine a widow who wants to maintain her standard of living at the same level she had before she had to pay the catastrophic surtax.
Although this widow earns only twice the minimum wage, largely due to the earnings limit, she would have to earn an additional $4,930 to offset her catastrophic surtax of $496. 

Eliminating the earnings limit would greatly help seniors and reduce the deficit.
Repeal would generate more in new taxes than the government would lose in increased Social Security benefit payments. 

We now need support from the Democrats on the Rules Committee in order to include earnings-limit reform in the Reconciliation Bill. 

Since all four Republicans on the committee are co-sponsors of my bill, it is the Democrats who will be held fully accountable if an earnings test amendment is not allowed from the floor. 

The time is now to lift the burdensome Social Security earnings limit from the backs of our nation's seniors.
