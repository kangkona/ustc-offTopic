Apple Computer Inc. posted improved fiscal fourth-quarter profit due largely to a $48 million gain on the sale of its stock in Adobe Systems Inc. 

Excluding the gain, the company registered a modest 4.6% increase for the quarter ended Sept. 29 to $113 million, or 87 cents a share, from the year-earlier $107.9 million, or 84 cents a share.
Proceeds of the Adobe sale brought net income in the quarter to $161.1 million, or $1.24 a share. 

Apple shares fell 75 cents in over-the-counter trading to close at $48 a share. 

Fiscal fourth-quarter sales grew about 18% to $1.38 billion from $1.17 billion a year earlier. 

Without the Adobe gain, Apple's full-year operating profit edged up 1.5% to $406 million, or $3.16 a share, from $400.3 million, or $3.08 a share.
Including the Adobe gain, full-year net was $454 million, or $3.53 a share. 

Sales for the year rose nearly 30% to $5.28 billion from $4.07 billion a year earlier.
John Sculley, chairman and chief executive officer, credited the Macintosh SE/30 and IIcx computers, introduced in the winter, for the brightened sales performance. 

Mr. Sculley also indicated that sagging margins, which dogged the company through most of 1989, began to turn up in the fourth quarter as chip prices eased. 

"Adverse pressure on gross margins . . . has subsided," Mr. Sculley said.
Margins in the fiscal fourth quarter perked up, rising to 51% from 49.2% a year earlier.
For all of fiscal 1989, however, the average gross margin was 49%, below the average 1988 gross margin of 51%. 

Lower component costs -- especially for DRAMs, or dynamic random access memory chips -- were cited for the easing of margin pressure on the company, a spokeswoman said. 

Looking ahead to 1990, Mr. Sculley predicted "another year of significant revenue growth," along with improved profitability, as the recovery in gross margins continues into 1990.
