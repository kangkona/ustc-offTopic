The Food and Drug Administration said American Home Products Corp. agreed to recall certain generic drugs that were produced by its Quantum Pharmics unit in Amityville, N.Y. 

Quantum stopped shipping the drugs last month, following a federal investigation regarding information the company supplied to obtain three drug approvals. 

The FDA requested the recall of Quantum's mioxidil tablets, chlorazepate dipotassium tablets and meclofenamate sodium capsules because, it said, the size of the production runs submitted for testing to gain FDA approval was in each case misrepresented as much larger than it actually was. 

American Home Products, based in New York, agreed to recall four other products, trazadone, doxepin, diazepam and lorazapam, because of concerns about data submitted in their original approval applications before the FDA. 

No safety problems with the products are known, the FDA said.
An FDA spokesperson said the drugs are still available under other brand names. 

Last month, American Home Products said it was suspending production and distribution of all 21 of Quantum's generic drug products pending the completion of an exhaustive internal audit.
It also temporarily closed Quantum, because of the internal investigation, as well as the FDA's ongoing inquiry. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, American Home Products rose 75 cents to $105 on Friday.
