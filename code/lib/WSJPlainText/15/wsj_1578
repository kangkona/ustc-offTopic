It was the second anniversary of the 1987 crash, but this time it was different.
Stocks rallied on good earnings reports and on data that showed less inflation than expected. 

Blue chips led the march up in heavy trading.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 39.55 points to 2683.20.
The 30 industrials led the market higher from the opening bell as foreign buyers stepped in.
By afternoon, the broader market joined the advance in full strength.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock Index rose 5.37 to 347.13 and the Nasdaq composite index jumped 7.52 to 470.80.
New York Stock Exchange volume swelled to 198,120,000 shares. 

The industrials were up about 60 points in the afternoon, but cautious investors took profits before the close. 

Traders said a variety of factors triggered the rally.
The consumer price index rose 0.2% in September, while many economists were looking for a 0.4% increase.
Stock-index arbitrage buy programs -- in which traders buy stock against offsetting positions in futures to lock in price differences -- helped the rally's momentum. 

The euphoria was such that investors responded to good earnings reports of companies such as American Express, while ignoring the disappointing profits of companies such as Caterpillar, analysts said. 

Stock-index arbitrage trading was a minor influence in yesterday's rally, traders said.
Institutional buyers were the main force pushing blue chips higher. 

To the amazement of some traders, takeover stocks were climbing again.
Hilton rose 2 7/8 to 100, for example.
Last Friday, takeover traders spilled out of Hilton, knocking the stock down 21 1/2 to 85.
Among other stocks involved in restructurings or rumored to be so: Holiday Corp. gained 1 7/8 to 73 and Honeywell rose 2 7/8 to 81 1/2. 

One floor trader noted in astonishment that nobody seemed to mind the news that British Airways isn't making a special effort to revive the UAL buy-out.
The announcement of the buy-out's troubles triggered the market's nose dive a week ago. 

Takeover enthusiasm may have been renewed when an investor group disclosed yesterday that it had obtained all the financing required to complete its $1.6 billion leveraged buy-out of American Medical International. "That's put some oomph back into this market," said Peter VandenBerg, a vice president of equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton. 

But some traders thought there was less to the rally than met the eye. "There is no strength behind this rally," asserted Chung Lew, head trader at Kleinwort Benson North America. "It's traders squaring positions.
It's not good; the market is setting up for another fall." 

Indeed, many traders said that uncertainty about today's monthly expiration of stocks-index futures and options, and options on individual stocks, prompted a lot of buying by speculative traders who were unwinding positions that were bets on declining stock prices. 

The number of outstanding contracts in the October Major Market Index jumped from 5,273 on Friday to 9,023 on Monday.
The MMI is a 20-stock index that mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Outstanding contracts are those that remain to be liquidated.
By Wednesday, the outstanding October contracts amounted to 8,524, representing about $1.13 billion in stock, noted Donald Selkin, head of stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities, who expects a volatile expiration today. "There has been a tremendous increase" in MMI positions, Mr. Selkin said.

Chemical and six other banks, along with First Boston, are providing the rest of the $1.6 billion. 

Elsewhere on the takeover front, Time Warner advanced 2 5/8 to 136 5/8 and Warner Communications tacked on 7/8 to 63 7/8.

Paramount Communications climbed 1 1/4 to 58 1/2 and MCA rose 1 1/2 to 64; both media companies have long been mentioned as potential acquisition candidates.
