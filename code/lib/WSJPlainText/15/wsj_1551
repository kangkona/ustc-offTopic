Dow Jones & Co. announced Wall Street Journal advertising rates for 1990. 

The rates, which take effect Jan. 2, include a 4% increase for national edition advertising.
The Journal also will offer expanded volume and frequency discounts. 

The increase for national edition advertising is less than the inflation rate and compares with a 6.5% increase in 1989. 

"Newsprint and postage prices this year have not gone up," said Peter R. Kann, president of Dow Jones. "We have invested in improved editorial quality and expanded our quality audience without substantially increasing our costs.
Fundamental fairness and a sense of responsibility lead us to share operating efficiencies with our customers." 

Advertising rates for the Eastern, Midwest, Western and Southwest editions will increase an average 5.5%, and rates for localized advertising editions will increase 7.5%.
Rates for the Wall Street Journal Reports will remain unchanged.
A one-time noncontract full-page advertisement in The Wall Street Journal national edition will cost $99,385. 

Advertising rates for The Wall Street Journal/Europe, published in Brussels and printed in the Netherlands and Switzerland, will increase 9%.
Rates for The Asian Wall Street Journal, published and printed in Hong Kong and also printed in Singapore and Tokyo, will rise 8%.
Rates for The Asian Wall Street Journal Weekly, published in New York for North American readers, will rise 6%. 

Dow Jones also publishes Barron's magazine, other periodicals and community newspapers and operates electronic business information services.
It owns 67% of Telerate Inc., a leading supplier of computerized financial information on global markets.
