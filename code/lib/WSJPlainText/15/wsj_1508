Procter & Gamble Co. and Noxell Corp. said they received early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act regarding the proposed $1.4 billion merger of Noxell into P&G. 

Shareholders of Noxell, of Hunt Valley, Md., will vote on the merger at a special meeting on Nov. 30, the companies said. 

P&G, Cincinnati, agreed to exchange 0.272 share of its common stock for each share of Noxell common and Class B stock, a total of about 11 million P&G shares. 

The transaction would mark the entry of P&G into cosmetics.
The company already markets a wide range of detergents, food, household and health-care products.
