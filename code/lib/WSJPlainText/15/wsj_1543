Lyondell Petrochemical Co. said third-quarter net income fell 54%, to $73 million, or 91 cents a share, from $160 million a year earlier. 

Year-earlier per-share results aren't applicable because the company went public in January.
Revenue rose 7.7% to $1.28 billion from $1.18 billion. 

The petrochemical maker said the biggest reason earnings declined was a loss of production time and the increased costs associated with a temporary maintenance closing and expansion of an olefins plant. 

Like other refiners, Lyondell's margins for chemicals and gasoline were narrower.
While the company said chemical margins continued to worsen this quarter, costs will be lower because the maintenance and expansions are complete. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Lyondell was unchanged at $18.50 a share.
