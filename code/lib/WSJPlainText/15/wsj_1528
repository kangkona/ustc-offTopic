Eagle Financial Corp. and Webster Financial Corp., two Connecticut savings bank-holding companies, agreed to merge in a tax-free stock transaction. 

The new holding company, Webster/Eagle Bancorp Inc., will have about $1.2 billion of assets and 19 banking offices in Connecticut.
Tangible capital will be about $115 million.
The merger is subject to regulatory clearance and a definitive agreement. 

In the merger, each share of Webster, based in Waterbury, will be converted into one share of the new company.
Each share of Eagle, based in Bristol, will become 0.95 share of Webster/Eagle. 

In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Eagle shares rose 12.5 cents to $11.
In national over-the-counter trading, Webster shares fell 25 cents to $12.375. 

Webster has 3.5 million shares outstanding and Eagle 2.6 million.
Their indicated market values thus are about $43.3 million and $28.6 million, respectively. 

Frank J. Pascale, chairman of Eagle, will be chairman of the new firm and James C. Smith, president and chief executive officer of Webster, will take those posts at Webster/Eagle. 

Harold W. Smith Sr., chairman of Webster, will become chairman emeritus and a director of the new company.
Ralph T. Linsley, vice chairman of Eagle, will become vice chairman of Webster/Eagle.
The board will be made up of seven directors of each holding company. 

In an interview, James Smith said the banks' "markets are contiguous and their business philosophies are similar and conservative." Nonperforming loans will make up only about 0.5% of the combined banks' total loans outstanding, he said. 

At June 30, Webster, which owns First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Waterbury, had assets of $699 million.
Eagle, which controls Bristol Federal Savings Bank and First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Torrington, had assets of $469.6 million on that date.
