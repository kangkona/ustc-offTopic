Bank of England Governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton urged banks to be cautious in financing leveraged buy-outs. 

"Caution should . . . be the rule of the day," said Mr. Leigh-Pemberton in a speech to the Association of Corporate Treasurers' annual dinner. "It would be damaging to industry and to the financial sector in general, to say nothing of banks, if prudence does not guide the financing of leveraged transactions." 

His remarks were distributed to the press before Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced his resignation last evening.
Bank of England officials said the central bank had no comment on Mr. Lawson's resignation. 

Mr. Leigh-Pemberton reiterated that the exposure of United Kingdom banks to leveraged deals haven't yet reached "worrying levels." However, in light of the risks involved in such transactions, banks should satisfy themselves that they have the skills to participate in this market and clear policy guidelines on acceptable levels of exposure to such transactions, he said. 

In other comments, he said takeovers may not always be the most efficient way of securing a change of corporate direction or strategy. "A similar result could sometimes be achieved, at less cost, by changing managements," he said.
