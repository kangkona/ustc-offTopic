Hong Kong's main measure of consumer prices rose 10% in September from a year earlier, the government said. 

The Consumer Price Index "A", which measures price changes for the 50% of urban households that spend between 2,000 Hong Kong dollars (US$256.18) and HK$6,499 a month, edged up 1.5% in September from August. 

Index "B", which monitors price changes for the 30% of urban households that spend between HK$6,500 and HK$9,999 a month, rose 9.9% last month from a year earlier and was up 1.3% from the preceding month. 

September's Hang Seng Consumer Price Index, which measures price changes for the 10% of urban households spending HK$10,000 and HK$24,999 a month, was up 11% from a year ago and up 1.3% from August. 

The main factors for the September increase from the previous month were higher prices for services, food and housing.
Prices fell marginally for fuel and electricity.
