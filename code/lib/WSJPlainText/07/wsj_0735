The Financial Accounting Standards Board said it will soon issue a rule requiring disclosure about the financial risk of certain financial instruments. 

But the chief rule-making body for accountants backed off one part of its original proposal made earlier this year that would have required a breakdown of certain balance-sheet items related to off-balance sheet instruments. 

The balance-sheet detail was opposed by many banks and thrifts that felt the cost of supplying such data wasn't worth the value of the disclosures. 

Under the initial proposal, for example, banks would have been required to disclose that portion of allowances for loan losses that reflects specific letters of credit for which customers had defaulted.
The final rule won't require such a breakdown of the allowances for loan losses, which appears on the balance sheet. 

The FASB rule will cover such financial instruments as interest rate swaps, financial guarantees, foward interest rate contracts, loan contracts, loan commitments and options written on securites held.
It will require companies to spell out in more detail collateral polices and concentrations of credit risk for all financial instruments. 

The rule will require companies with financial instruments that have off-balance sheet risks to disclose data about the value and terms of the instruments, any accounting loss that would occur if the outside party involved in the instrument failed to perform, and the company's policy for requiring collateral or other security for the instrument. 

Scott Miller, an FASB project manager, said that a final rule will be issued before year end.
But he noted that the initial effective date of the earlier proposal had been delayed by six months.
The new rule will be effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after June 15,
