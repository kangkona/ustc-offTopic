W.R. Grace & Co. said it formed a new horticultural-products company by combining its soil-nutrients and fertilizers business with Sierra Chemical Co., Milpitas, Calif. 

Grace, a maker of specialty chemicals that already owned about 30% of closely held Sierra, said it owns a 49% stake in the new company.
Grace said it didn't invest any additional capital in the venture, which will be known as Grace-Sierra Horticultural Products Co. 

The business is expected to have sales of about $100 million in 1990, Grace said.
The new company's product lines will be aimed at nurseries, greenhouses and the lawn and garden industry.
