.START 

Ready, Willing and Unable 

I always lift the hood 

When my car doesn't start; 

If gadgets at home don't work 

I coolly take them apart. 

I'll admit there's nothing wrong 

That I ever do find, 

But it's nice when people say 

I appear mechanically inclined. 

-- Joshua Adams. 

Flick Shock 

At the movies today 

In detail you see 

What the prof wouldn't show 

In Physiology Three. 

-- Robert Gordon. 

Candid Comment 

Don't worry; people will learn to read as long as there are TV program listings. 

-- John Drybred.
