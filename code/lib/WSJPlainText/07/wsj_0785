Canadian production of market pulp rose 1% in September from a year earlier as the industry operated at 87% of capacity. 

The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 532,000 metric tons of market pulp in September, compared with 527,000 metric tons a year earlier. 

Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper and other products.
The statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill.
Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp. 

The September 87% operating rate compared with a rate of 101% in August but was unchanged from a year earlier. 

In the first nine months of this year output was 5,377,000 metric tons, down from 5,441,000 metric tons a year earlier.
