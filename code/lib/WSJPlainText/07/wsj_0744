A state appellate court reinstated the 1987 convictions of Pymm Thermometer Corp. and two of its executives on charges of assault for exposing workers to toxic mercury vapors. 

The indictment charged that Pymm operated a machine to crush broken thermometers and recover the mercury in an illegal workroom.
The charges said that one worker suffered permanent brain damage from mercury exposure. 

The judge handling the case in state Supreme Court, a trial court, had tossed out the jury verdicts, ruling that the matter should have been handled under federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules.
But the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court held that federal law didn't pre-empt the states from such a prosecution. 

Elizabeth Holtzman, district attorney for Brooklyn, N.Y., said, "The appellate division has agreed with our view that despite federal worker-safety laws, state prosecutors have the power to protect working people." 

Lawyers for the company and executives couldn't be reached for comment. 

The executives face five to 15 years in prison and fines of $5,000 or double the profit made by failing to comply with the rules.
The company could be fined a maximum of $10,000, or double the profit.
