SYDNEY-Qintex Australia Ltd., under pressure from bank lenders, has called in accounting firm Peat Marwick Hungerfords to help oversee asset sales and restructure the resorts and media company. 

Analysts said the move could presage even harsher action by the banks.
But any move by the banks to take over Qintex Australia's management could threaten its ability to operate its national television network under Australian broadcast license rules.
That, in turn, could substantially reduce the value of the television assets. 

The appointment of Peat Marwick, which has a unit that specializes in advising troubled companies, came about as a result of a round of meetings held by Qintex Australia Chairman Christopher Skase with bank creditors. 

Yesterday, Mr. Skase said the company is "solvent and with the continued support of its bankers is able to meet its financial commitments." 

Qintex Australia is a unit of Qintex Ltd.
The Qintex group's problems began in earnest in March, when Mr. Skase agreed to buy MGM/UA Communications Co.
But the transaction faltered in September, when Qintex Australia was forced to increase its offer to US$1.5 billion following a counterbid from Rupert Murdoch; the deal fell apart altogether earlier this month. 

Qintex Australia owes creditors around A$1.2 billion.
Last Friday, Qintex Entertainment Inc., its 43%-owned U.S. TV production and distribution affiliate, filed for Chapter 11 protection.
