Shell Canada Ltd. said it plans to build a lubricants blending and packaging plant at Brockville, Ontario, with start-up scheduled for 1992. 

A spokesman said the plant, which will replace older lubricant and grease manufacturing plants in Montreal and Toronto, will cost about 50 million Canadian dollars (US$42.5 million) to build.
Brockville is about 100 miles east of Toronto. 

Shell Canada, an oil and gas producer and marketer, is a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, an Anglo-Dutch concern.
