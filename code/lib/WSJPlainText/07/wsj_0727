S.A. Brewing Holdings Ltd. began laying the groundwork to launch a rival offer for Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. 's Australian brewing operations. 

Such an offer could torpedo a plan by Lion Nathan Ltd. of New Zealand to acquire half the brewing interests.
But it would probably increase the amount of cash that debt-ridden Bond Corp. would earn from the transaction. 

Australia's National Companies and Securities Commission said it will allow S.A. Brewing to acquire an option on as much as 20% of Bell Resources Ltd., a unit of Bond Corp. that is in the process of acquiring Bond Corp. 's brewing businesses for 2.5 billion Australian dollars (US$1.93 billion). 

S.A. Brewing, which is 20%-owned by Elders IXL Ltd., Australia's largest brewer, will make a takeover offer for all of Bell Resources if it exercises the option, the corporate regulators said in a statement. 

Bond Corp., a brewing, property, media and resources concern controlled by financier Alan Bond, is selling many of its assets to reduce an A$6.9 billion debt.
