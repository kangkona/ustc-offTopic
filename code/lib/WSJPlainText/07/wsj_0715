West Germany's cost-of-living index rose a preliminary 0.3% in October from September and was up 3.3% from a year earlier, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said. 

The increase follows a monthly rise of 0.2% in September from August. 

Preliminary cost-of-living data for the current month are calculated based on inflation data from the four largest West German states -- Baden-Wuerttemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Bavaria and Hesse.
