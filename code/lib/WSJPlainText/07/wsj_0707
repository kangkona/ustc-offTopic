South Africa's current account surplus swelled to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of between five billion and six billion rand ($1.9 billion and $2.28 billion) in the third quarter, Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals said. 

The surplus was two billion rand in the second quarter and 2.7 billion rand in the first quarter. 

He said this improvement means it is still possible to reach the targeted current account surplus of four billion rand for 1989.
