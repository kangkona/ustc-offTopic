I was impressed by the perceptiveness of your Sept. 12 story "Rural Enterprise: Tough Row To Hoe." 

We lived in rural areas many years, but now live in St. Louis County, Mo.
This morning as I drove the 13 miles to my law office and endured the routine heavy traffic during that twice-daily journey, I thought of how fortunate it was that we made the decision to be residents of an expanding community with so many opportunities and where so much is happening. 

The presence of so many people, cars and competing businesses is evidence of a healthy economy in a place where people want to live. 

I thought back to our time in small, sparsely populated communities.
I remembered how hard it was for an outsider to become accepted by long-established, stake-holding residents, and what pitfalls awaited an original thinker in societies that were long accustomed to unchanging, "safe" ways of thought and action. 

I remembered being fired at age 44, with five children at home, when my views and actions were deemed unsettling by a timid, small-town employer.
How difficult it is for a thinking person to live among societies rooted in the past. 

Now, I revel in the freedom, culture, activity and diversity of this great metropolitan area with its traffic jams and perpetual road-building projects. 

Yet when my youngest child died two years ago, I buried him in the church cemetery of a small Missouri town. 

So after all, even the bitterest critic of rural exclusivity harbors a continuing yearning for those scarce, rural virtues thought to exist amid fields, forests and country lanes.
