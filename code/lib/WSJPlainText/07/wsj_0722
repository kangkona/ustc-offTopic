Calgene Inc. and Gustafson Inc. said they plan a joint project to develop biological products to control such plant diseases as aflatoxin, a potent cancer-causing agent. 

Under the plan, the companies will use Calgene's patented technology to encapsulate microbes such as Bacillus subtilis, a bacterium, to enhance their biological activity against plant diseases. 

Calgene, an agricultural biotechnology concern, said initial work will concentrate on a proprietary strain of Bacillus subtilis which has shown promise for controlling aflatoxin.
The strain was discovered by Morinaga & Co. and licensed to Gustafson, a unit of Uniroyal Chemical Co. 

Aflatoxin is released by molds during grain and seed storage.
The recent appearance of aflatoxin in such foods as corn and peanut butter has sparked public concern and consumer scrutiny of food handling and storage procedures.
