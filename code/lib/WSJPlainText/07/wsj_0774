Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said it expects to report an extraordinary loss of about $122 million in the fourth quarter due to early retirement of debt. 

The cable programmer said the loss will consist primarily of prepayment penalties, and unamortized issue discount and costs related to its just-completed $1.6 billion refinancing of its long-term debt and some preferred stock in one of its subsidiaries. 

A Turner spokesman wouldn't speculate on the extent of the charge's effect on the quarter's earnings, but said the company continues to expect to report a net loss for 1989. 

The company said the repayment or redemption of the long-term debt, and the outstanding Class A cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of Cable News Network, was made possible by an offering of about $750 million of debentures and notes and $900 million in bank borrowings. 

The offering included $550 million of 12% senior subordinated debentures due 2001 and $200 million of zero coupon liquid yield option notes due 2004.
The notes were priced to yield 8% and are convertible into the company's Class B common stock at a price which represents a 15% premium over the market price on Oct. 10, 1989. 

In addition, the company called its 12 7/8% senior subordinated notes due 1994, with an aggregate principal amount of $200 million, for redemption on Dec. 15. 

As a result of the refinancing, the company said the interest on the debt will fall to slightly more than 11% from slightly more than 14%. 

In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Turner's Class A stock closed at $50.50, down 37.5 cents.
