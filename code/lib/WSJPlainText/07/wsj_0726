Eight people, including a supervisor of Security Pacific National Bank's central vault, were arrested in an investigation of an alleged drug money-laundering operation. 

The U.S. Attorney's office filed a criminal complaint against six bank employees charging them with conspiracy in the scheme, which apparently was capable of handling millions of dollars a week by funneling cash through fictitious bank accounts.
Two other men also were charged with participating in the operation. 

The arrests capped a four-month investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Attorney's office and a Security Pacific internal investigation team.
Walter S. Fisher, executive vice president and general auditor of the bank's parent, Security Pacific Corp., said no bank funds were at risk during the investigation. 

Arrested were Jose O. Lopez, 27 years old, of Whittier, Calif., the vault supervisor; Carlos O. Huerta, 29, of La Puente; Luis A. Arroyo, 36, of Los Angeles; Ignacio Rojas Jr., 32, of Baldwin Park; Doris Moreno, 37, of Bell Gardens; and Ana L. Azucena, 27, of Huntington Park.
Geno M. Apicella, 27, of Los Angeles, and Terrell N. Madison, 27, of Hawthorne, were also charged with participating in the conspiracy. 

Each defendant faces a possible sentence of 20 years in prison and $250,000 in fines.
The defendants couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
