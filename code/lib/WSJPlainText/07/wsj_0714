Furukawa Electric Co., one of Japan's leading electric wire and cable manufacturers, said unconsolidated pretax profit in the fiscal first half ended Sept. 30 fell 5.3% to 6.11 billion yen ($43.1 million) from 6.45 billion yen a year earlier. 

Sales increased 11.9% to 279.39 billion yen from 249.68 billion yen.
Net fell 1% to 3.23 billion yen from 3.26 billion yen.
Pershare net fell to 4.97 yen from 5.40 yen. 

The growing sales sustained by domestic demand failed to counter rising material metal costs and declining profitability in overseas construction, Furukawa said. 

Rolled copper product sales were major contributors to overall sales growth.
Sales by category rose 24% to 35.23 billion yen, reflecting increased production in automobile, airconditioner and electric machine industries, which are major users of wire and cable products. 

Sales for electric wires and cables rose 13.2% to 153.93 billion yen.
