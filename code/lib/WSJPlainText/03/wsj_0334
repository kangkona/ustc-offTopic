Marks & Spencer PLC reported a 12% gain in first-half pretax profit, mainly because of improving performances in the U.K. and continental Europe. 

In the six months ended Sept. 30, pretax profit at the British clothing and food retailer rose to #208.7 million ($330.1 million) from #185.5 million a year ago. 

The results surpassed analysts' forecasts, which averaged around #200 million, and Marks & Spencer responded in trading on London's Stock Exchange with an eight pence rise to 188 pence. 

Profit after tax and minority interest but before extraordinary items rose 12% to #135.2 million; per-share earnings rose to five pence from 4.5 pence. 

Marks declared an interim per-share dividend of 1.85 pence, compared with 1.7 pence a year earlier. 

Sales increased 11% to #2.5 billion from #2.25 billion, while operating profit climbed 13% to #225.7 million from #199.8 million. 

Sales in North America and the Far East were inflated by acquisitions, rising 62% to #278 million.
Operating profit dropped 35%, however, to #3.8 million.
Brooks Brothers, which Marks bought last year, saw operating profit drop in half to #5 million.
