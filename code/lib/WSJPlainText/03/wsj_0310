Gillette Co., Boston, said it is planning to restructure its South African subsidiary.
Under the plan, Gillette South Africa will sell manufacturing facilities in Springs, South Africa, and its business in toiletries and plastic bags to Twins Pharmaceuticals Ltd., an affiliate of Anglo American Corp., a South African company. 

Terms were not disclosed.
A final agreement has not been signed, and the moves will not have a material effect on the company, Gillette said.
The company said it is part of a continuing world-wide restructuring in which it has downsized or sold operations in several countries.
Gillette said its continued presence in South Africa "enables it to make meaningful contributions to South African society, to the lives of its employees and to the communities in which it operates." Gillette South Africa employs about 250 people.
About 60% of the work force will continue with Gillette or transfer to Twins Pharmaceuticals, the company said.
