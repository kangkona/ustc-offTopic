Stock prices surged as a multibillion-dollar takeover proposal helped restore market players' confidence about the prospects for further deal-making. 

Paper and forest-products stocks were especially strong, as the offer for Great Northern Nekoosa by Georgia-Pacific triggered speculation that the industry could be in for a wave of merger activity. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 41.60 to 2645.08 even though some late selling caused the market to retreat from session highs.
Trading was moderate, with 176,100,000 shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange. 

Aside from the takeover news, big buy orders were placed for blue-chip shares in afternoon trading.
Traders said the buy programs came from very large institutional accounts that were also active in the stock-index futures markets.
At one point, almost all of the shares in the 20-stock Major Market Index, which mimics the industrial average, were sharply higher. 

Some 1,111 Big Board issues advanced in price and only 448 declined, while broader market averages rose sharply.
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index climbed 5.29 to 340.36, the Dow Jones Equity Market Index added 4.70 to 318.79 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index climbed 2.65 to 

Great Northern surged 20 1/8 to 62 7/8, well above Georgia-Pacific's offering price of $58 a share, amid speculation that other suitors for the company would surface or that the bid would be raised.
Nearly 6.3 million shares, or about 11.5% of the company's shares outstanding, changed hands in Big Board composite trading. 

With stocks having been battered lately because of the collapse of takeover offers for UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, and AMR, the parent of American Airlines, analysts viewed the proposal as a psychological lift for the market. 

The $3.18 billion bid, which had been rumored since last week, "creates a better feeling that there's value in the market at current levels and renews prospects for a hot tape," says A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research Corp. 

Traders and analysts alike said the market's surge also reflected an easing of concerns about volatility because of moves by a number of brokerage firms to curtail or cease stock-index arbitrage.
Much of the instability in stock prices lately has been blamed on arbitrage trading, designed to profit from differences in prices between stocks and index futures. 

"People are looking for an ability to try and read the market, rather than be manipulated," said Dudley A. Eppel, manager of equity trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
He noted that institutional investors showed "pretty general" interest in stocks in the latest session. 

But traders also said arbitrage-related trading contributed to the market's surge, as buy programs boosted prices shortly after the opening and sporadically through the remainder of the session.
