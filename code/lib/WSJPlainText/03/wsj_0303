Earlier this year, President Bush made a final "take-it-or-leave it" offer on the minimum wage: an increase to $4.25 an hour over three years, and only if accompanied by a lower wage for the first six months of a job.
Now, the White House has decided to accept the higher wage over only two years.
The sub-minimum wage would apply only to first-time teen-age workers for 90 days.
The White House had enough votes to sustain a veto but chose to avoid a confrontation.
The only permanent losers will be the 200,000 or so workers everyone agrees will be priced out of a job at the $4.25 rate Congress is likely to approve today.
It is compromises such as this that convince Washington's liberals that if they simply stay the course, this administration will stray from its own course on this and other issues.
