Deere & Co. said it reached a tentative agreement with the machinists' union at its Horicon, Wis., plant, ending a month-old strike by workers at the facility. 

The maker of farm equipment said the three-year labor agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers at John Deere Horicon Works, Deere's primary facility for producing lawn and grounds-care equipment, takes effect immediately and extends through Oct. 1, 1992.
About 1,150 employees are covered by the new agreement, Deere said.
