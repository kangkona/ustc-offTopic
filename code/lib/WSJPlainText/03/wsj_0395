The stock market stumbled after getting off to a strong start and closed mixed in lackluster trading. 

Bargain-hunting and futures-related program buying lifted prices at the outset, but the rise proved short-lived as concerns about this week's economic reports and the potential for further losses in stocks weighed on investors. 

Selected blue-chip issues attracted buying interest, however, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average stayed in positive territory throughout the entire session.
The average, which peaked with a gain of more than 23 points, added 6.76 to 2603.48. 

Broader market averages were little changed.
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index went up 0.01 to 335.07, the Dow Jones Equity Market Index dipped 0.01 to 314.09 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index eased 0.01 to 185.59. 

Activity was fairly brisk at the opening as hopes for a recovery from last week's string of five consecutive losses in the industrial average led some investors into the market.
Program buying related to stock-index arbitrage then surfaced shortly after 10 a.m. EST and carried prices to their session highs. 

But the pace slowed quickly following the round of arbitrage-related buying, involving the sale of index futures contracts and the purchase of stocks, and stayed sluggish through the rest of the session as prices drifted. "People are sitting on their hands," said Bill Langevin, manager of institutional trading at Morgan Keegan & Co., Memphis, Tenn. 

Just 126,630,000 shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with 170.3 million Friday and 135.9 million last Monday.
Declining stocks led advancers on the Big Board, 774 to 684. 

Traders attributed the lackluster activity in part to anticipation of the first pieces of economic data for October: a monthly survey of corporate purchasing managers, due tomorrow, and the employment report, set for Friday. 

Also, a number of analysts believe stocks could fall to the vicinity of their lows during the market's mid-October sell-off before posting any sustainable gains.
The industrial average hit bottom near the 2500 level on both Oct. 13 and Oct. 16. 

The market has begun a process of "trying to find a floor" after its fall, said William M. LeFevre, a market strategist at Advest Inc., Hartford, Conn.
He added that the floor could prove to be well above the recent price lows, depending on whether the economic data ease concerns about slower growth. 

Chevron gained 7/8 to 67 1/4 in Big Board composite trading of 2.1 million shares amid continued speculation that Pennzoil is building a stake in the company.
USA Today reported that an unknown party -- possibly Pennzoil -- acting on its own or with a partner holds between 3.5% and 4.7% of the company's common shares. 

Other strong performers among blue-chip issues included Procter & Gamble, which went up 2 3/8 to 127 3/4; Aluminum Co. of America, up 1 to 69 1/4, and Primerica, up 3/4 to 28 1/4.
Also, Philip Morris gained 3/4 to 42 1/8 on 1.7 million shares. 

UAL Corp. moved up 4 to 175 on reports that Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis has asked United Airlines unions if they're interested in cooperating with him in a new bid for UAL.
But neither the pilots nor the machinists appear interested, and Mr. Davis is barred from making a new bid under terms of an agreement he made with UAL in September, unless UAL accepts an offer below $300 a share. 

International Business Machines fell 3/8 to 99 1/2 as 1.2 million shares changed hands.
Unisys went down 1 to 15 1/4 on 1.3 million shares and Hewlett-Packard skidded 2 3/8 to 47, but Digital Equipment rose 1 3/8 to 90 1/2 and Compaq Computer added 1 to 101 5/8.
Texas Instruments, which re-entered the personal computer market by introducing three portable models, added 1/2 to 31 1/8. 

One series of dividend-related trades accounted for most of the volume in Southern Co., the Big Board's most active issue, which closed down 1/8 to 27 1/4 on 5.2 million shares.
The utility carries an 8% dividend yield and goes ex-dividend today. 

Crossland Savings tumbled 1 1/2 to 3 3/4 in the wake of its management's recommendation to suspend dividends, because of concerns that it may not meet capital requirements under new federal regulations.
The proposed criteria would bar Crossland from including its $380 million of preferred stock as so-called "core capital." 

American Savings Bank, which could face a similar problem with the new capital criteria, dropped 7/8 to 9 5/8.
The company had $173.5 million in preferred stock outstanding as of June 30. 

Meanwhile, the savings-and-loan sector fared better than any other Dow Jones industry group.
H.F. Ahmanson rose 3/8 to 19 1/8, Great Western Financial gained 5/8 to 19 3/4, Golden West Financial added 1/2 to 26 3/8 and CalFed went up 1/2 to 23 1/4. 

Battle Mountain Gold, which reported that third-quarter earnings fell 85% from a year ago, lost 5/8 to 16 1/8.
Other precious-metals stocks finished mixed after rallying late last week; Homestake Mining went down 1/8 to 16 3/4, Newmont Gold added 7/8 to 41 1/4 and ASA Ltd. slid 1/2 to 49 1/8. 

Paramount Communications dropped 1 to 54 3/4 amid rumors that the $3.35 billion sale of its Associates Corp. unit to Ford Motor could be delayed until mid-November.
The company said the sale was "on track" to close by today. 

Nashua jumped 4 1/2 to 33 1/2 despite taking steps to ward off Reiss & Co., a Dutch company that is seeking U.S. antitrust clearance to acquire as much as 25% of its common stock.
Nashua expanded a stock-repurchase program by one million common shares -- about 10.6% of its shares outstanding -- and toughened a takeover defense. 

Unum gained 2 to 43.
The company reported that third-quarter earnings were 34% higher than a year earlier, a sharper rise than analysts had expected.
Telecom USA skidded 4 to 28 1/2.
Its earnings from operations for the third quarter were above the year-ago level, but fell short of analysts' forecasts. 

The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 1.14 to 368.87.
Volume totaled 10,100,000 shares.
