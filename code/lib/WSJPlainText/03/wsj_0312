Trial and Terror 

At times I sequester my mind 

When I must think with precision, 

Detached from all other thoughts 

While trying to reach a decision. 

But often nothing's resolved, 

To my frustration and fury: 

With pros and cons in limbo, 

I feel like a hung jury.

Rodeo applause: broncs cheer.
