The city's Department of Consumer Affairs charged Newmark & Lewis Inc. with failing to deliver on its promise of lowering prices. 

In a civil suit commenced in state Supreme Court in New York, the agency alleged that the consumer-electronics and appliance discount-retailing chain engaged in deceptive advertising by claiming to have "lowered every price on every item" as part of an advertising campaign that began June 1. 

The agency said it monitored Newmark & Lewis's advertised prices before and after the ad campaign, and found that the prices of at least 50 different items either increased or stayed the same. 

In late May, Newmark & Lewis announced a plan to cut prices 5% to 20% and eliminate what it called a "standard discount-retailing practice" of negotiating individual deals with customers. 

The consumer agency also disputed Newmark & Lewis's continuing strategy of advertising "new lower prices" when allgedly there haven't been price reductions since June 1. 

Richard D. Lewis, president of the 47-store chain, defended the company's pricing campaign, saying it didn't use "the misleading expression `reduced from original prices. '" Mr. Lewis said the company marked price tags and advertised at its "lowest possible prices" for all its merchandise to reduce public confusion. 

Mr. Lewis said the company gave the Consumer Affairs department "volumes of documents" to substantiate its statements, and made "every effort to comply" with all the agency's policies. 

In its suit, the consumer agency seeks fines of $1,000 per violation of the city's Consumer Protection Law, costs of investigation, and an injunction to prevent Newmark & Lewis from continuing its allegedly deceptive advertising.
