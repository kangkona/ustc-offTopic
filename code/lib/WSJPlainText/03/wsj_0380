Japan's steel exports fell 12.2% in September from a year earlier and were down 1.1% from the previous month, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation reported. 

September was the 10th consecutive month in which steel exports failed to reach the year-earlier level. 

A federation official attributed the decline to brisk demand from domestic industries backed by continuing economic expansion in Japan. 

Japanese steel companies are apparently focusing on domestic sales, but the official said it doesn't necessarily mean that local sales contracts are increasing that markedly. 

"They are just too busy to meet domestic demand and have little room for overseas shipments," the official said.
