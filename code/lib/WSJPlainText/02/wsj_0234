Metromedia Co. said its Metromedia Long Distance unit has been renamed Metromedia-ITT Long Distance, reflecting acquisitions from ITT Corp., which licenses its name to closely held Metromedia. 

Metromedia said its unit is the fifth-largest provider of long-distance communications service in the U.S., with projected 1989 revenue of more than $550 million. 

Metromedia, headed by John W. Kluge, has interests in telecommunications, robotic painting, computer software, restaurants and entertainment.
