Du Pont Co., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Los Alamos National Laboratory said they signed a three-year, $11 million agreement to collaborate on superconductor research. 

The collaboration will include at least 25 researchers and will be aimed primarily at developing thin films of high-temperature superconductors for use in electronics, the companies said.
The materials, discovered during the past three years, conduct electricity without resistance and promise smaller, faster computers and other new technologies. 

Joint-research programs have proliferated as U.S. companies seek to spread the risks and costs of commercializing new superconductors and to meet the challenges posed by foreign consortia, especially in Japan. 

The latest research pact bolsters Du Pont's growing portfolio of investments in superconductors.
The Wilmington, Del., chemicals concern previously signed research superconductor agreements with Oak Ridge National Laboratory and with Argonne National Laboratory.
Last year, Du Pont agreed to pay $4.5 million for rights to superconductor work at the University of Houston. 

Hewlett-Packard is a Palo Alto, Calif., computer maker.
The Los Alamos laboratory is one of three U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories designed as pilot centers to foster joint industry-government programs to speed the transfer of new superconductors to the marketplace.
