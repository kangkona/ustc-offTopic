Japan's index of leading indicators rose to 63.6 in August, above the so-called boom-or-bust line of 50 for the first time since May, the Economic Planning Agency said. 

The leading index recovered from July's revised level of 36.6 on strong performances in consumer durables and machinery orders, among other factors, according to an agency spokeswoman. 

The index is intended to measure future economic performance.
A figure above 50 indicates the economy is likely to expand; one below 50 indicates a contraction may be ahead.
