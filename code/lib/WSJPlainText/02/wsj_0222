People's Savings Financial Corp. said it will buy back as much as 10% of its 2.4 million shares outstanding because the stock is undervalued. 

The holding company said it has been "unfairly associated" with other banks in New England that have had major loan losses in recent quarters.
The company said its People's Savings Bank unit doesn't have a "large exposure to construction and commercial loans that have caused the loan-loss problems in many of the banks."
