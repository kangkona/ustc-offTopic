Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the ratings on about $3.2 billion of Houston Lighting & Power Co. 's securities because of the company's low levels of interest coverage and internal cash generation. 

Houston Lighting is a unit of Houston Industries Inc., a utility holding company in Houston. 

Downgraded by Moody's were Houston Lighting's first-mortgage bonds and secured pollution-control bonds to single-A-3 from single-A-2; unsecured pollution-control bonds to Baa-1 from single-A-3; preferred stock to single-A-3 from single-A-2; a shelf registration for preferred stock to a preliminary rating of single-A-3 from a preliminary rating of single-A-2; two shelf registrations for collateralized debt securities to a preliminary rating of single-A-3 from a preliminary rating of single-A-2, and the unit's rating for commercial paper to Prime-2 from Prime-1. 

Moody's said Houston Lighting's current situation has some positive aspects, including managing "very well" the construction and commercial operation risks of Units 1 and 2 of the South Texas Project nuclear power plant.
Capital requirements will be declining and no new generating facilities will be required for several years, Moody's said.
