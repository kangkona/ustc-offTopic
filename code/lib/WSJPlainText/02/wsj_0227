Erwin Tomash, the 67-year-old founder of this maker of data communications products and a former chairman and chief executive, resigned as a director.
Dataproducts is fighting a hostile tender offer by DPC Acquisition Partners, a group led by New York-based Crescott Investments Associates.
Under the circumstances, Dataproducts said, Mr. Tomash said he was unable to devote the time required because of other commitments.
Mr. Tomash will remain as a director emeritus.
The company had no comment on whether a replacement would be named.
