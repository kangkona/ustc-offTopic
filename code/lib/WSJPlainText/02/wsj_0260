Panhandle Eastern Corp. said it applied, on behalf of two of its subsidiaries, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for permission to build a 352-mile, $273 million pipeline system from Pittsburg County, Okla., to Independence, Miss. 

The natural gas pipeline concern said the 500 million cubic feet a day capacity pipeline would be built by a proposed joint venture between two Panhandle Eastern units-Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. and Trunkline Gas Co. Texas Eastern Transmission will build and operate the system, which will connect the Arkoma Basin with several interstate pipelines.
