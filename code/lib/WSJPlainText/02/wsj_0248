Your Oct. 2 page-one article on people riding so-called "railbikes" on railroad tracks was a disservice to your readers.
It unfortunately encourages others to engage in a highly dangerous and illegal activity that only a very few are doing now.
And it treats such activities in a frivolous, cavalier fashion, with total indifference to common sense and public safety.
