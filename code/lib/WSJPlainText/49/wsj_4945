PaineWebber Group Inc. said an internal investigation of its dealings with the Department of Housing and Urban Development didn't uncover any misconduct by the company or its employees. 

The financial-services firm focused on the activities of a first vice president, Lance Wilson, a former senior HUD official who is an important figure in the influence-peddling scandal at the federal housing agency. 

The company's investigative report, released Friday, showed that Mr. Wilson lobbied HUD officials for PaineWebber and played an important role in its HUD-related business.
But the company said it had found "no basis for reaching a conclusion" that he sought to improperly influence HUD decision makers. 

There was one caveat to the PaineWebber report: It said Mr. Wilson's expense-account reports showed that from 1986 through last August he had entertained "various HUD officials." In an interview, a company official said the entertainment involved lunches and dinners.
In one case, the official said, Mr. Wilson picked up a $1,089 tab for a July 1986 dinner for a senior HUD official and friend, Deborah Gore Dean, and 13 other people. 

PaineWebber said in its report that it didn't know whether the expenditures were proper, but the company said Mr. Wilson "steadfastly maintained" that he hadn't tried to improperly influence HUD officials.
His attorney, Raymond Banoun, said over the weekend that Mr. Wilson's expenses were proper and had been reviewed by his PaineWebber superiors. 

Nonetheless, a House subcommittee, which will hear testimony from PaineWebber officials on Wednesday, is likely to investigate Mr. Wilson's expenses.
He also is scheduled to testify that same day, but he plans to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. 

Besides working as a PaineWebber investment banker, Mr. Wilson made substantial profits from personal investments in HUD-subsidized apartments. 

Mr. Wilson was the executive assistant to the Reagan administration's HUD secretary, Samuel Pierce, from 1981 to mid1984. 

In its report, PaineWebber listed the HUD-related transactions on which Mr. Wilson worked for the company.
PaineWebber repeatedly said it didn't find any evidence of wrongdoing.
Mr. Wilson, now on a paid leave from PaineWebber, helped the Wall Street firm in a number of areas, including its successful bid last year to become HUD's financial adviser on the sale of loan assets. 

A HUD review panel had recommended another firm, but Mr. Pierce's undersecretary, Carl Covitz, gave the job to PaineWebber.
According to PaineWebber's report, Mr. Wilson said he spoke to three HUD officials before Mr. Covitz made his decision, including Mr. Covitz's top aide.
The company said, however, that the contract was "awarded in an open competitive bidding process" and that it "found no evidence of impropriety." 

Mr. Wilson, the company said, also worked on the PaineWebber team that represented an Arkansas state agency before HUD in the May 1988 acquisition of other HUD loan assets.
In that case, PaineWebber received $5.4 million in underwriting and finder's fees from the state agency, the Arkansas Development Finance Agency.
The Arkansas agency acquired $388.7 million in mortgage loans from a HUD unit, with proceeds from a federally backed bond issue underwritten by PaineWebber. 

The company took pains to note that its large fees were negotiated in "arm's length" transactions with the president of the Arkansas agency, Wooten Epes.
Mr. Epes later went to work as executive vice president of KRC Resources Inc., a consulting firm and a subsidiary of a law firm, Kutak, Rock & Campbell, that acted as PaineWebber's counsel on the bond issue transaction.
Mr. Epes said the Kutak law firm wasn't involved in negotiating PaineWebber's fees.
