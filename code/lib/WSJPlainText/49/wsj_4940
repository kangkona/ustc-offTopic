A group led by Merrill Lynch & Co. is expected to step in for Citicorp Venture Capital as the buyer of the Del Monte canned-foods business from RJR Nabisco Inc. 

An announcement is expected as early as today of the details of the sale, which was revamped after the staff of the Federal Reserve Board balked at allowing the Citicorp unit to lead the purchase.
However, the price of $1.48 billion isn't expected to change. 

Federal banking rules bar banks from holding more than 5% of the voting stock and 25% of the non-voting stock in non-financial companies.
But some banks have participated in leveraged buy-outs under waivers allowing them to buy nearly 50% of small businesses. 

In the current climate in which several leveraged companies have run into trouble, unsettling the entire junk-bond market, the Fed apparently drew the line at allowing the Del Monte unit to qualify as a small business. 

Merrill, which had been advising Citicorp on the proposed purchase, will instead lead a group of buyers in the realigned sale, which will account for about 75% of the Del Monte equity.
Citicorp is expected to take the remaining 25%. 

The Merrill group may include a Japanese company but won't include Merrill's own leveraged buy-out fund, Merrill Lynch Capital Partners.
Merrill may try to round up other equity participants even after the sale announcement. 

If completed, the restructured transaction will be the last major transaction in a plan by RJR to sell $5.5 billion worth of food assets within the first year after its record $25 billion leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. 

RJR already announced an $875 million sale of Del Monte's fresh-fruit business to Polly Peck International PLC. Earlier last summer, it sold several European food businesses for $2.5 billion.
Although the price of the Del Monte canned-foods unit came in slightly less than expected, one reason was that operations in Canada and Latin America weren't included.
