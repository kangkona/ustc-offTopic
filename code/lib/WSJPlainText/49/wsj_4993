Datapoint Corp., in the midst of a power struggle for control of its board, said it had a net loss of $8.9 million in the fourth quarter ended July 29, against year-earlier net income of $2.6 million, or two cents a share. 

The fourth-quarter loss, combined with an even-larger third-period deficit, resulted in a loss for fiscal 1989 of $29.2 million, against year-ago net of $8 million.
Preferred-dividend requirements exceeded fiscal 1988's net. 

Fourth-quarter revenue was $79 million, down 10.3% from the prior year's $88.1 million.
For all of fiscal 1989, revenue totaled $312.5 million, down 5.5% from $330.8 million a year earlier. 

Martin Ackerman, a New York attorney who is seeking control of Datapoint's board through a consent solicitation, said the current losses support his contention that the company has deteriorated since being taken over by corporate raider Asher Edelman.
The company makes data-processing systems. 

Efforts to reach Mr. Edelman for comment weren't successful. 

Datapoint officials blame most of the losses of the past six months on consolidations and streamlining that they estimate will reduce operating costs $20 million annually.
They also say that Datapoint's investment portfolio gained $3.3 million in the past fiscal year. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Datapoint closed at $5.625, up 12.5 cents. 

Mr. Ackerman's bid for control of Datapoint was dealt a severe blow recently when Mr. Edelman bought a block of approximately three million shares, increasing his holdings to 40% from about 10% of the company's common stock outstanding.
Mr. Ackerman controls 4.6% of the company's stock.
