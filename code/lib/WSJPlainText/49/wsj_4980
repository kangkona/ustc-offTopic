Sterling Bancorp, New York, said it will apply additional funds to its reserve for taxes after settling disputes with authorities, which will result in a net charge of $3.2 million against third-quarter earnings. 

Theodore H. Silbert, chairman, wouldn't disclose the amount of its settlement, the company's level of tax reserves or changes in reserves.
He said the company remains "moderately profitable." 

The bank holding company of Sterling National Bank & Trust Co. said it settled disputes with federal, state and city governments for 1977 through 1981, citing expenses of fighting such government claims.
Mr. Silbert attributed the disputes principally to the compounding of interest and divestiture of non-banking subsidiaries prior to 1979. 

In the first six months, the company had a loss of $1.99 million, resulting from the "high prevailing costs" of some short-term debt it was servicing. 

Sterling also increased its board membership to 14 and elected Lillian Berkman and Eugene T. Rossides as directors.
