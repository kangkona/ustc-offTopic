Cooker Restaurant Corp. said its employee stock ownership plan has agreed to buy 1,084,606 shares, or 10% of its common stock, for $3.25 a share, payable over 2 1/2 years without interest. 

Half the shares will be purchased from the company's former president, Philip J. Hickey Jr., who was replaced earlier this month as president after his unsuccessful bid to gain control.
The purchase is part an agreement with Mr. Hickey, who has also agreed to resign from the board. 

The remaining shares will be purchased, as part of a separate agreement, from Gerald A. Hornbeck, vice president of development for Cooker Restaurant.
Mr. Hornbeck will resign as vice president to serve Cooker as a restaurant-development consultant. 

Messrs.
Hickey and Hornbeck have agreed to enter non-competition agreements and a five-year agreement not to acquire an interest in Cooker or to participate in any proxy contest regarding Cooker.
