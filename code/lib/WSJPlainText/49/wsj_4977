Immunex Corp. and Receptech Corp. said they filed a joint registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed initial public offering of 2.5 million units for $30 million, or $12 a unit. 

Under the offering, each unit will hold one share of callable common stock of Receptech, a shell formed by Immunex executives to conduct research on Immunex products, and a warrant to buy one Immunex common stock.
The shares and warrants will trade as one unit through June 30, 1992, at which point they will trade separately. 

Immunex, a biotechnology concern, said the agreement also allows it to buy all Receptech shares issued under the offering before June 30, 1992. 

A company spokesman said such a transaction would depend on the merit of the research conducted by Receptech, formed in August to develop cytokine receptor products for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, emphysema and septic shock. 

Immunex and Receptech said they have given underwriters the option to buy up to 375,000 additional units to cover over-allotments.
Prudential-Bache Capital Funding, New York, and Hambrecht & Quist Inc., San Francisco, are managing underwriters. 

The joint filing follows a series of Immunex announcements last week under which the company will re-acquire the right to manufacture and market promising biological agents for the treatment of cancer and immune dysfunction. 

Immunex, which in the early 1980s licensed away the right to make and sell products it had developed, now has shifted gears and is reclaiming rights to such products in an effort to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company.
