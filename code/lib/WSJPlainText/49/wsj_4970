Standard Federal Bank said it adopted a shareholder-rights plan that allows holders to purchase common stock at half the market price in the event of a takeover attempt. 

Among other things, the rights plan will distribute one right to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of preferred stock for each of its common shares outstanding. 

The plan, which takes effect Oct. 12, may be triggered by a tender offer for at least 20% of the company's common stock, or the actual acquisition of at least 15%. 

In a statement, Thomas R. Ricketts, Standard Federal chairman, said, "The plan is designed to ensure that all of Standard Federal's shareholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover and to discourage abusive takeover techniques.
While not preventing a takeover, the rights should encourage anyone seeking to acquire Standard Federal to negotiate first with Standard Federal's board." 

The rights plan expires Oct. 12, 1999.
