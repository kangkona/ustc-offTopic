Farberware Inc. sued a former employee for allegedly wiretapping the company president and accepting illicit cash payments from vendors. 

The lawsuit, filed last week in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, in December 1988, William Groben, then a vice president, operations, at Farberware, had wiretaps installed in the offices of Peter Cameron, Farberware president. 

Others named in the suit include Mr. Groben's wife and two sons and ten vendors that allegedly made payments to Mr. Groben in exchange for continuing their contracts with the the company and for purchasing goods at excessive prices. 

Alan Kaufman, Mr. Groben's lawyer, said he couldn't comment because he hadn't seen the suit. 

Farberware, a New York-based kitchenware manufacturer, is a subsidiary of Hanson Industries, the U.S. arm of Hanson 

According to the complaint, tapes of Mr. Cameron's telephone calls were mailed to Farberware executives, employees, and competitors in January 1989.
After an investigation by Farberware, Mr. Groben was dismissed, said John S. Martin Jr. of Schulte Roth & Zabel, Farberware's lawyer.
Mr. Martin wouldn't disclose the subject of the conversations or Mr. Groben's alleged motives for making the tapes. 

The defendants have been charged under the controversial Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, under which Farberware is entitled to seek three times the amount of damages it sustained.
The suit alleges that the defendants' activities constituted a pattern of racketeering activity. 

In August the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan filed a criminal complaint against Mr. Groben, charging him with illegal wiretapping.
