Vernitron Corp. indicated it might still seek to acquire Kollmorgen Corp., but not for the cash price of $25 a share it previously offered. 

Vernitron, a closely held industrial electronics company in Deer Park, N.Y., last week withdrew from its $320 million merger agreement with Kollmorgen, citing "adverse changes" in Kollmorgen and other factors it didn't anticipate when it reached a definitive merger agreement in April.
In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Vernitron said it is considering its options regarding Kollmorgen, including another offer of less than $25 a share in cash, securities or a combination of the two. 

Vernitron said it can't propose another transaction until after April 30, 1990, under a standstill provision of the recent merger agreement.
It holds 593,700 shares, or about 5.6%, of Kollmorgen shares.
It said it may buy more shares on the open market or in private transactions, or it may sell some or all of its holding. 

Kollmorgen shares Friday closed at $16.75, down $1.625, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Kollmorgen is a Simsbury, Conn., maker of electronics, industrial and defense products. 

Vernitron also said it is considering its options regarding a bank credit and bridge financing agreements in connection with the recent merger, which was scheduled to be completed by Sept. 30.
Stephen W. Bershad, Vernitron's chairman, wasn't available to comment on the merger withdrawal or the SEC filing.
