First Woburn Bancorp said its net loss of $7.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30 has been revised to $10.6 million. 

The change relates to a revision made to the estimate of federal income tax benefits, the banking concern said. 

"The effect of the correction is that part of the income tax benefit associated with the company's net loss for fiscal 1989 has been delayed.
This benefit will be recognized during future periods, as the company returns to profitability," said Frank J. Porcaro, president. 

In an unrelated event, Vernon W. Parkhurst, the concern's 71-year-old chairman, retired.
The company has no plans to name a successor.
