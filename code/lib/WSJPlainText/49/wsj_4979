Pacific Telesis Group said its board adopted a shareholder rights' plan under which holders will be granted one right for each common share held as of Oct. 

If a bidder buys 20% or more of the telephone company's stock, or if the board finds that a bidder who owns at least 10% of the stock is "adverse" to shareholders' interests, the new rights would allow holders, except the hostile bidder, to buy more stock at half the price at that time. 

As of June 30, Pacific Telesis had 411.5 million common shares outstanding, held by about 1.1 million owners.
