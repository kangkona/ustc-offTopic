U.S. Banknote Co. said the expiration date of its $7-a-share tender offer for International Banknote Co. has been extended to Oct. 13. 

The offer has been extended several times to continue negotiations with the Justice Department over antitrust questions about the proposed merger.
Both companies print stock certificates and currencies. 

U.S. Banknote has offered $7 a share, or $126 million, for as many as 14.9 million shares of International Banknote.
As of Sept. 21, 16 million shares, or about 84% of the common stock outstanding, had been tendered.
