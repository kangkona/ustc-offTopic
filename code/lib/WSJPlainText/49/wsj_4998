Italy's Ferruzzi Group said its trading activities could post a loss of $100 million by the end of 1989 because of the impact of "extraordinary events" on international trading operations. 

Ferruzzi said in a brief statement that the losses would be reflected in the parent company's balance sheet and that financial operations have "largely been completed" to offset the losses. 

Ferruzzi issued the statement in response to a report in an Italian financial newspaper that the trading practices of two senior traders in Ferruzzi's Paris office had cost the group as much as $200 million for operations including, but not limited to, soybean trading. 

The two traders resigned last month, citing "differences over trading strategy." They had been actively involved in Ferruzzi's aggressive trading of soybeans and other commodities.
At the time of the resignations, Ferruzzi announced it had launched a reorganization of its trading operations in the agribusiness sector.
