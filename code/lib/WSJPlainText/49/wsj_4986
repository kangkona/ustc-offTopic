Chiefly because of strong domestic demand, Japan's production of cars, trucks and buses in August increased 13.7% from a year earlier to 890,339 units, a record for the month, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association announced. 

Production dropped in July, by a marginal 0.2%, for the first time in five months. 

The latest total exceeded the previous high for the month of 804,184 units set in August 1987.
