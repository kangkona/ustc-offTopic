Lost Generation? 

Geographical ignorance harms our nation's business, 

For today it's sad to report, 

Yuppie types think the Pacific Rim's found 

On a Chinese basketball court. 

-- Edward F. Dempsey. 

Hand Shaken 

From enthusiastic greeting 

I now cease and desist -- 

That's since a "high five" 

Almost broke my wrist. 

-- Joshua Adams.
