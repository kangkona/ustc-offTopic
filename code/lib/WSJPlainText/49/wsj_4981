Jiffy Lube International Inc. said the closing of its restructuring agreement with Pennzoil Co. will be delayed pending settlement of two class-action lawsuits against Jiffy Lube. 

"Pennzoil has advised the company that it will not close until there is a resolution," said a spokeswoman for Jiffy Lube. 

The restructuring plan, originally scheduled to take effect next Sunday, would give Pennzoil 80% of Jiffy Lube's common stock in exchange for $20 million in cash and a revision of debt outstanding. 

Jiffy Lube said it was continuing "good faith" discussions with Pennzoil for an extension of the deadline.
Jiffy Lube's stock closed at $3, down 12.5 cents, in over-the-counter trading Friday.
