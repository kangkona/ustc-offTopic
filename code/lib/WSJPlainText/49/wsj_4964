Adobe Systems Inc. said its board authorized the purchase of as much as $15 million of its common stock on the open market in periodic purchases. 

The software concern said it was buying the shares because it represents a "sound investment" that will benefit all shareholders.
The company's shares plummeted $3.25 last week to close at $16.50-a drop of 35% from the start of the month.
The stock rose 87.5 cents in over-the-counter trading Friday. 

Adobe's stock declined after Apple Computer Inc., Adobe's largest customer, and Microsoft Inc., the biggest maker of personal-computer software, said they would offer a product that would rival Adobe's PostScript software. 

Adobe said it will use cash on hand to buy the shares, which represent 4.8% of the company's common outstanding at current stock prices.
The company said it anticipates that the shares will be used for employee benefit plans and other purposes.
After the purchases, Adobe will have 19.9 million common shares outstanding. 

Separately, the company said it reached an agreement with the optronics division of Chelmsford, Mass.-based Integraph Corp.
Under the agreement, the division will have licensing rights to PostScript, software that allows rather low-cost document printing on high-resolution typesetters, for use in its products.
Terms weren't disclosed.
