Secomerica Inc., a unit of Tokyo-based Secom Co., said it reached an agreement to acquire home health-care services provider, HMSS Inc., for $50 a share, or about $250 million. 

Secomerica, which said its parent will finance the transaction with cash as well as probably "some borrowings," is expected to begin a tender offer later this week for all HMSS shares outstanding. 

Houston-based HMSS specializes in the in-home administration of intravenous medications, nutrients and fluids, which Secomerica described as "the fastest growing segment" of the entire health-care services industry. 

"There are two very powerful currents driving" the business, Michael S. Kaye, president and chief executive officer of Secomerica, said in an interview. 

The first, he said, is the nationwide effort to cut health-care costs while maintaining quality.
The second is the simple fact that "people feel more comfortable at home," Mr. Kaye said. "Nobody likes to be in an institution.
That's a very powerful theme, and it's gaining even more momentum." 

Indeed, HMSS has grown 60% annually for the past four years.
For the six months ended June 30, the company's net income soared 76.9% to $2.3 million from $1.3 million.
Revenue climbed 59.5% to $23.6 million from $14.8 million. 

Dale Ross, HMSS's president and chief executive, described the arrangement as "an excellent fit," noting that Secomerica already provides commercial and residential security and emergency medical services.
He also said in an interview that HMSS should continue to "significantly outperform the market" over the next few years. 

HMSS's stock will probably be de-listed from the Nasdaq Composite Index within a month or so, when it becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of Secomerica.
In national over-the-counter trading, HMSS shares closed Friday at $34.75 a share, up $1.
