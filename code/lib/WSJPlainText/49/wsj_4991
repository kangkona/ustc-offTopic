Unisys Corp., Blue Bell, Pa., is to announce today that it signed an agreement that will let it market an American Telephone & Telegraph Co. network management system. 

Systems such as the AT&T Accumaster Integrator are needed by corporate customers whose computer and telecommunications networks are becoming so large and complex that they need a system to tie all the pieces together. 

Jerry Caccappolo, a Unisys vice president, said Unisys has developed its own software to manage the various parts of computer and telecommunications networks but needed an integrator that the computer concern could provide to its customers.
He said Unisys decided against developing one on its own because there will be room for very few of these systems in the marketplace.
He said AT&T, International Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. already have staked out the territory.
