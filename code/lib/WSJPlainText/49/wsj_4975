American Healthcare Management Inc. said John A. Bradley, its chairman and chief executive officer, and David A. Huff, its vice chairman and president, resigned effective Sept. 8. 

The hospital management concern said the resignations were part of its internal reorganization plan.
American Healthcare is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, which protects a company from creditors while it tries to work out a plan to pay its debts.
But the company's first plan -- under which it would have been bought by Bain Capital and Merrill Lynch Capital Markets -- collapsed a few weeks ago when operating results continued to deteriorate. 

That left the internal reorganization plan, which a company spokesman said has been approved by American Healthcare debt holders and is scheduled for a court confirmation hearing Oct. 3.
The plan meant replacing Messrs.
Bradley and Huff, who are two of the company's three founders. (The third founder left several years ago.) 

"In Dallas, when you buy a football team or a company, you get to pick your own coach," said Mr. Bradley.
His plans, he added, are "to go fishin'." 

American Healthcare, meanwhile, has appointed its chief financial officer, Mark L. Plaumann, as acting president while it searches for a new chief executive. 

American Healthcare finished the second quarter with a 70% drop in net income to $1.4 million from $4.6 million the year earlier.
The company owns or leases 18 hospitals in 10 states.
