Lotus Development Corp. said it agreed to acquire a 15% interest in Sybase Inc., a closely held developer of database software. 

Terms weren't disclosed.
But industry sources pegged the purchase price at about $25 million.
The agreement also provides for Sybase, of Emeryville, Calif., to sell an additional 10% of the company to Lotus at a future date. 

Frank King, senior vice president of Lotus software products group, will serve on Sybase's board.
The first product of the partnership will be the Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3. 

Lotus, one of the software industry's largest companies, acquired a minority interest in another closely held company, computer software developer Rational Systems Inc., in July. 

David G. Bayer, an analyst with Montgomery Securities Inc., said Sybase's revenue will exceed $55 million this year, and he forecasts further growth in 1990. 

Sybase also has struck cooperative agreements with computer makers Apple Computer Inc. and Next Inc. and with software developers Microsoft Corp. and Ashton-Tate, he said. "This is an extremely important strategic maneuver for Lotus," Mr. Bayer said.
