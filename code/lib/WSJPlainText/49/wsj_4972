Bombay Palace Restaurants Inc. filed under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law because the Internal Revenue Service was planning to seize its restaurants. 

The filing was made in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York on behalf of the parent and 52 subsidiaries, about 46 of which are restaurants.
The filing excludes certain foreign subsidiaries, said Russell W. Rosen, corporate counsel and a director at Bombay Palace, which operates Bombay Palace and Beefsteak Charlie's outlets. 

"We couldn't get out from under the taxes.
The IRS was on our tail and we had to do something," Mr. Rosen said.
Some of the company's problems are market-related, he said, and it has "heavy debt service," some of it tied to the 1987 acquisition of Lifestyle Restaurants Inc., which operated Beefsteak Charlie's restaurants. 

Chapter 11 protects a company from lawsuits by its creditors while it works out a plan to pay its debts.
Bombay Palace is "taking a hard look, a careful look" at its operations and will emerge from Chapter 11 a stronger company, Mr. Rosen said.
It is too early to speculate on what actions the company might take in reorganizing or on how long it might take to file a plan with the court, he added. 

In the filing, Bombay Palace says it has current assets of $7.2 million and current liabilities of $20.8 million.
The company has nearly 4.6 million shares outstanding, of which about 2.1 million, or 45%, are held by Chairman Sant C. Chatwal.
The shares trade over the counter on the pink sheets.
The company has $5.3 million of 8% exchangeable senior debentures and $4.7 million of 13% convertible subordinated debentures outstanding, the filing says.
