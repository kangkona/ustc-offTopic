The trustees of BRNF Liquidating Trust, Wilmington, Del., said Cauff, Lippman & Co. offered $155 million for most of the trust's assets, increasing by $7 million an offer spurned several months ago. 

Under the terms of the offer, Cauff Lippman, a Miami-based aircraft leasing company, would acquire the main asset of BRNF, comprising 20 Boeing 727-200 jet planes leased to Braniff Inc., plus $3.1 million in cash.
Any additional cash would remain in the trust. 

BRNF was created in 1983 when Braniff International Inc. was in bankruptcy-law proceedings, and the lease payments are used to pay creditors.
Braniff Inc. is the Orlando Fla.-based successor to Braniff International.
