K-H Corp., formerly Fruehauf Corp., said it won't pay the regular quarterly in-kind dividend on its $3.68 Series A Cumulative Exchangeable Redeemable Preferred Stock on Saturday. 

The auto-parts maker said because of a "substantial deficiency in book value," it believes Delaware corporate law forbids it from paying a dividend.
This is the second consecutive quarter that K-H hasn't declared and distributed a dividend.
