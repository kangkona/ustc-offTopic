Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said they are adjusting some 1990-model prices. 

Ford lowered final 1990 prices on six slow-selling models and increased prices of some popular cars from previously announced pre-introduction levels.
Separately, Chrysler announced cash rebates on some Jeep and Dodge trucks. 

Ford's biggest price decrease came on the 1990 Ford Festiva L model, which dropped $151 to $6,319 from its $6,470 pre-introduction price.
The Festiva's final price is still 4.1% above the 1989 base price. 

Final prices on the Mercury Cougar and Topaz, along with Ford Thunderbird and Tempo, also fell from the tentative levels announced in the summer.
Buyers who paid the higher pre-introduction prices will get a check from Ford to cover the difference. 

Ford's biggest increase from the preliminary prices came on the Ford Mustang GT convertible, which rose $502 to $18,805, a 7.4% jump from the 1989 base price.
Other cars on which Ford raised final prices included the Mercury Grand Marquis and Ford Taurus. 

Chrysler said it is offering $1,000 rebates on the 1990 Cherokee Laredo and Limited models, 1990 Jeep Wagoneer Limited and Grand Wagoneer and on most of its 1990 Comanches.
The 1990 Cherokee Pioneer and the 1990 Comanche two-wheel-drive short bed will have $500 rebates. 

Chrysler also increased rebates on its 1990 Dodge Ramcharger to $2,000 from $1,500 and on certain 1988 and 1989 Comanches to $1,500 from $750.
The alternative of low-interest financing is unchanged from the program announced Sept. 16.
