Japan's reserves of gold, convertible foreign currencies, and special drawing rights fell by a sharp $2.20 billion in September, to $86.12 billion, the Finance Ministry announced, for the fifth-straight monthly decline. 

The noticeable downturn is being viewed as an indication of the intensity of Bank of Japan intervention for the month, particularly following late September's International Monetary Fund and Group of Seven meeting in Washington.
G-7 nations include the U.S., Japan, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy and Canada. 

It follows on the heels of a $547 million decrease in the country's foreign reserves in August to $88.32 billion.
