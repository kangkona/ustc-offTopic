UGI Corp. said it completed its acquisition of the Utility Propane Co. unit of KCS Group for $21.3 million, plus working capital. 

The Utility Propane business would be wholly owned by UGI's AmeriGas subsidiary.
UGI, a utility, has sold most of AmeriGas's industrial-gas interests and is using proceeds mainly to expand the unit's propane operations. 

Utility Propane serves more than 15,000 retail and wholesale customers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
The transaction is subject to approval by the government and by holders of KCS, of Edison, N.J.
