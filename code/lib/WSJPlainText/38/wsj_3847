Super Club NV is expected to announce this week a definitive agreement to acquire Record Bar Inc., a Durham, N.C.-based retailer of audio and video products. 

Darrell Baldwin, chief executive officer of Super Club North America Corp., a unit of the Antwerp-based video company, said the price would be between $50 million and $100 million.
He wouldn't be specific. 

Record Bar operates 167 stores under the Record Bar and Tracks trade names, primarily in the Southeast and Middle Atlantic states.
The chain is closely held by the family of its chairman, Barrie Bergman, associates and General Atlantic Investments Ltd., a New York investment concern.
Record Bar's annual revenue is about $120 million, Mr. Baldwin said.
