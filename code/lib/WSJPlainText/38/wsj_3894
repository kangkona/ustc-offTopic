Occidental Petroleum Corp. said its domestic oil and gas subsidiary, Oxy USA Inc., sold to Exxon Corp. for about $148 million its interests in several oil and gas wells in Wyoming, Texas, Alabama and New Mexico. 

The largest stake sold was Occidental's 15.7% working interest in the Hartzog Draw property in Campbell County, Wyo. 

Occidental said the sale resulted in a significant gain that will be reflected in its third-quarter earnings.
The gain more than offsets a third-quarter charge incurred by Occidental in connection with an organizational restructuring to lower future operating costs, the company said.
Last month Occidental said it would restructure its flagging domestic oil and gas business, eliminating 900 jobs with the goal of saving $100 million a year. 

An Exxon spokesman said the $148 million purchase will give the company an interest in 2,100 oil and gas wells.
They will provide Exxon with an additional 4,200 barrels a day of oil production and 704 million cubic feet of gas production.
Exxon typically produces 731,000 barrels a day of oil and 1,855 million cubic feet of gas.
