Deere & Co. said 950 unionized workers walked off the job at its plant in Horicon, Wis., after rejecting a proposed contract to replace the one that expired Sunday. 

The Moline, Ill.-based maker of farm-equipment said the strike began when the shift scheduled to report at 11 p.m. Sunday didn't report at the plant, which is the company's primary facility for producing lawn and grounds-care products. 

A spokesman said it was "premature" to try to assess the financial impact of the machinists' union strike.
While declining to provide details of the contract Deere offered, he said the proposed pact "involves no givebacks or takeaways." 

While salaried workers are reporting to work at the facility, Deere said, no production is under way and there are "no immediate plans" to try to resume operations. 

Deere has about 38,800 workers world-wide, the company said.
