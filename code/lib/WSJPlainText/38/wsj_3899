Xyvision Inc., Wakefield, Mass., said it will take a substantial restructuring charge and will post a significant loss for its second quarter ended Saturday. 

The company wouldn't project the amount of the charges or the loss. 

In the year-ago quarter, the company had operating profit of $75,000, or one cent a share.
A tax credit of $24,000 made net income $99,000, or two cents a share.
Revenue was $11 million. 

The computer-integrated publishing systems company said it will cut its 380 person work force by 80 employees as part of a restructuring that will also consolidate the operations of a unit, Xyvision Design Systems Inc. 

The company attributed its expected losses to a softness in the marketplace and the fact that the company's products are in a transition period.
Several new products will be introduced in the spring.
