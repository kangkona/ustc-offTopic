Citadel Holding Corp. said it received regulatory approval to change the name of its Fidelity Federal Savings & Loan Association unit to Fidelity Federal Bank, a Federal Savings Bank. 

Approval came last week from the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, which oversees the savings and loan industry. 

In making the change, Citadel cited competitors that have similarly jettisoned "savings and loan" from their name because of the recent thrift-industry turmoil that has made some depositors skittish.
