Honeywell Inc. said it sold its 50% ownership in HNSX Supercomputers Inc. to joint-venture partner NEC Corp. Terms weren't disclosed. 

The venture was set up in 1986 to market supercomputers in North America but never sold a machine.
NEC said the business would continue with its existing objectives and staff.
Honeywell, which divested itself of its other computer businesses in recent years, said the supercomputer operation no longer fits its strategy. 

HNSX has a lone sales office, in Burlington, Mass. 

The joint venture sought to market machines made by Tokyo-based NEC, but was frustrated partly because of the government's reluctance to buy foreign-made supercomputers, which are regarded as strategic technology.
As a result, Cray Research Inc. has a virtual monopoly on sales to the government as well as about two-thirds of the world-wide market for the large, superfast computers. 

Last year NEC withdrew the proposed sale of a supercomputer to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after objections from the Commerce Department. 

Japanese supercomputer makers also have been hampered by a late entry into parallel processing, a technique whereby supercomputers break up complex problems and work on several aspects simultaneously.
A shortage of applications software also has hampered Japanese efforts to penetrate the U.S. market.
