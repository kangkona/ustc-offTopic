Buell Industries Inc. said it will take a charge in the fourth quarter of about $3.6 million, or $1.58 a share. 

The charge is a result of the recent sale of the company's screw and nut product lines and the layoff of about 175 employees at its plant in Waterbury, Conn., where the company is based. 

The charge will include employee severance costs, estimated future losses of the sold operations that will be phased out over the next few months, consolidation of the company's remaining operations at the Waterbury plant into a smaller area within the plant, and reduction of the carrying value of excess production capacity previously used in its operations. 

For the year-ago fourth quarter, the company earned $425,000, or 19 cents a share.
For the nine months ended July 31, Buell earned $489,000, or 21 cents a share.
