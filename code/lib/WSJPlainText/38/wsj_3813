Ramada Inc. said it wouldn't conclude its much-delayed restructuring this week because of tumult in the junk-bond market, but stressed that the financing troubles don't imperil the restructuring. 

Ramada said the situation in the junk-bond market was causing it to possibly change the terms and types of securities to be offered by Aztar Corp., the new company that will operate Ramada's gambling operations.
Salomon Brothers Inc. was expected to underwrite an offering of high-yield notes: $170 million in first-mortgage notes, $130 million in senior-subordinated reset notes and $100 million in senior-subordinated notes as part of the financing. 

But now, Ramada said it may issue warrants to buy 10% of Aztar's common stock as part of the $230 million of debt securities to be sold as part of the financing.
Financing will still include the $170 million in first-mortgage notes. 

A Ramada spokesman said he couldn't state when the restructuring would be completed. 

Ramada agreed to sell its lodging business to New World Development Co., of Hong Kong, and Prime Motor Inns Inc. of Fairfield, N.J., for $540 million.
The restructuring's final step will be the merger of Ramada and a subsidiary of New World, and the distribution to Ramada shareholders of cash and stock in Aztar.
