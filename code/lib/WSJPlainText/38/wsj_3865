Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said it agreed with Olympia & York Developments Ltd. to restructure and extend to 2004 Drexel's lease of office space at 60 Broad St. in Manhattan, site of the investment banking firm's headquarters.
The old lease would have expired in 1993. 

Drexel, which earlier this year announced a major restructuring, including elimination of its retail operations, said it will consolidate its New York business at the location.
Those operations are now spread over four city locations.
