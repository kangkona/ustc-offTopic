Buffton Corp. said it expects to report a net loss for its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 despite a gain from the sale of a division. 

The company said a pretax operating loss of about $2 million will more than offset a $1.5 million pretax gain from the sale of its Helix Wire unit for $7.3 million.
The avionics, electronics and plastic-products maker attributed much of the loss to problems in the plastic-pipe industry. 

For the year-earlier quarter, Buffton had net income of $905,106, or 22 cents a share, on revenue of $25.6 million. 

In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Buffton closed at $4.50 a share, down 25 cents.
