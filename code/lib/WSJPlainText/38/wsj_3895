Westvaco Corp., New York, said it will spend $400 million for a new paper-making machine and to increase the pulping capacity at its Covington, Va., bleached paperboard mill. 

The paper, packaging and chemicals concern called the planned expenditure the largest single investment in the company's history.
The paper industry generally is expanding in response to rising demand for paper and paperboard, which is being fueled by the U.S.'s continuing overall economic growth. 

The new machine will go on line in June 1992, Westvaco said, and will initially produce 600 tons of paperboard a day.
Paperboard is used for packaging food, beverages, personal-care and other consumer goods.
