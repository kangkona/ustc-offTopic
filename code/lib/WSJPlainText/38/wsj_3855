ICI Americas Inc. said it will invest $100 million in a St. Gabriel, La., plant to produce a substitute for a chemical linked to depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer. 

The company said it expects the plant to begin producing the substitute, generally called HFC 134a, in 1992.
The compound could be used to replace CFC-12, a chlorofluorocarbon currently used as a refrigerant in auto air conditioners and in refrigerators and freezers. 

ICI is the U.S. subsidiary of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, London.
