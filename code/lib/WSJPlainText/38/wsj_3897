HealthVest said it doesn't have enough cash to make about $6.5 million of interest payments due shortly and said it is negotiating with bank and insurance-company lenders to postpone the payments. 

The real-estate investment trust is in a liquidity bind because its Healthcare International Inc. affiliate, which manages many health-care properties that HealthVest owns, has failed to make about $6.2 million in rent and mortgage payments for August, September and October. 

HealthVest said it is negotiating with Healthcare for a 120-day standstill agreement requiring that at least some of the rent and mortgage payments be made during that period and that an interest-bearing note be issued to HealthVest for the remainder.
In addition, Healthcare would reimburse HealthVest for $1.1 million that HealthVest advanced to construction contractors for work on various health-care facilities. 

HealthVest said the standstill agreement will be contingent on Healthcare receiving an equity infusion, a loan or selling assets.
Healthcare, which also is in a severe cash crunch, has been trying to sell assets or find investors to help it out.
