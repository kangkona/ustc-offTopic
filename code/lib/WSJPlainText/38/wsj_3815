Kellogg Co., citing "intense competition" in the U.S. ready-to-eat cereal market, said third-quarter earnings would be below last year's record $145.7 million, or $1.18 a share. 

As a result, stock of the world's largest cereal maker fell $2.25 a share, to close at $71.375, in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
At one point the stock was off more than $3. 

Kellogg said it still expects higher earnings for the year and that it remains optimistic about long-term growth prospects.
Last year, the company had net income of $480.4 million, or $3.90 a share, on sales of $4.3 billion. 

Although it still has about 37% of the domestic cereal market, Kellogg lately has been giving up share to its chief rival, General Mills Inc., which has been better able to capitalize on the oat-bran craze. 

Goldman, Sachs & Co. food analyst Nomi Ghez said Kellogg's earnings projection for the quarter just ended reflects a combination of "very tough competition and some mistakes they made." While General Mills rolled out another Cheerios-brand variety, Kellogg misread the country's appetite for oat-bran, she said. 

"Instead of going after more good-for-you cereals, they decided to go after nostalgia," Ms. Ghez said, noting that Kellogg's big product introduction for the year was to have been the graham-flour-based S.W. Graham cereal.
Moreover, she said, Kellogg "didn't put enough promotional money behind basic products," so has seen declines in such staples as Corn Flakes. 

Following Kellogg's announcement, the analyst reduced her third-quarter estimate to $1 from $1.20.
For the year she estimates earnings of $3.95. 

Last month Kellogg said that its president, Horst W. Schroeder, had suddenly resigned.
He had been widely regarded as the company's next chief executive officer.
