Callahan Mining Corp. said it closed indefinitely its Ropes Gold Mine in Michigan because of ground slippage near the shaft. 

C.D. Snead Jr., Callahan's chairman, said low gold prices and continuing losses at the mine make additional expenses for ground control "difficult to justify" and could also keep the company from reopening the facility even if the slippage problem was corrected.
He said only about a year's production remains in the mine. 

Callahan, which also owns silver mines, had a net loss of $2.5 million for the first six months, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $1.3 million.
