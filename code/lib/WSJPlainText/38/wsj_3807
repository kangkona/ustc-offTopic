The Bush administration is preparing a $200 million loan to help Poland restructure its troubled economy, officials said. 

The loan is part of a White House effort to beef up its aid for the new Polish government and counter criticisms of being too timid in addressing the changes in Eastern Europe.
The loan would be in addition to the $119 million in aid announced by the president during his visit to Poland in July, and the $108 million in food aid that was approved after Solidarity rose to power in August. 

The loan was agreed to by President Bush's economic and foreign-policy advisers in a meeting yesterday, but hasn't yet been approved by the president. 

Administration officials decided to make the loan after seeing the outlines of a tough economic reform plan, which Polish ministers presented to the administration last week.
But the loan will be disbursed only after the Polish government reaches agreement with the International Monetary Fund on an economic plan. 

In addition, the administration is also planning to send a team of "experts" to Poland to help it deal with economic problems.
The team is likely to include Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher. 

The latest move by the Bush administration is partly a bow to political reality.
The Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have approved more than $1 billion in aid, and it seems likely that Congress will give the administration more money than it has sought.
