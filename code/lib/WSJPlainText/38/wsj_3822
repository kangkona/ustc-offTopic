Spending on new construction turned upward in August after two months of decline, but spending for private residential projects dropped slightly, the Commerce Department said. 

Construction spending rose 1.8% in August to an annual rate of $421.8 billion, after dropping 0.6% in July and 0.8% in June.
Most of the increase was for public projects, which aren't as sensitive to national economic trends.
Total outlays were up 3.4% from August 1988.
All the numbers are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations. 

After adjusting for inflation, construction spending grew 0.7% in August after falling 0.9% in July.
Spending was 0.6% below August 1988 after adjusting for inflation. 

Some analysts expect a slight pickup in private residential housing in the current quarter because of declining mortgage rates.
Others say a further spending decline in this category is likely because new projects won't be counted until they are completed, which mightn't be until next year.
Most agree that the overall volume of construction will taper off over the next few years. 

Seasonally adjusted spending on private residential projects declined 0.1% in August to an annual rate of $198.9 billion, after a 0.2% rise in July. 

Public construction spending grew 5.3% in August to an annual rate of $86 billion.
But much of that spending was for federal highway projects, which "need to be done and can't wait," said Richard Peach, deputy chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. 

Here are the Commerce Department's figures for construction spending in billions of dollars at seasonally adjusted annual rates.
