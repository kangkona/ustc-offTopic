Intel Corp. will build a $400 million computer-and-semiconductor plant in Ireland, reflecting a move by U.S. companies to position themselves to sell to an increasingly unified Europe. 

Intel said construction will begin immediately in Leixlip, Ireland, on a 150,000-square-foot factory that will make desktop computers next year for sale in Europe.
Intel said it later will expand the 55-acre facility, near Dublin, to include computer-chip fabrication and assembly lines.
Intel said it will spend $400 million over 10 years to fully develop the site. 

Intel had been looking for a European plant site for some time, partly in response to a growing tendency among European customers to buy locally, particularly as the 1992 unification of Western European markets approaches.
Anti-dumping provisions in the European Economic Community require that parts that go into some equipment sold in the region be locally made or face customs duties. 

What's more, 24% of Intel's $2.9 billion in 1988 revenue came from Europe, where sales are growing twice as fast as in the U.S.
The Ireland plant will allow Intel to better serve European customers, the company said. 

Intel also said it needed new production capacity in desktop computers.
So the Ireland plant, which will employ 400 by 1992, won't replace production in its Oregon, Puerto Rico and Singapore computer plants, it said.
The Irish-made machines will go to European vendors, who will sell them under their own labels. 

The Irish plant will be Intel's first in Europe.
Intel joins a move among technology companies to open new operations to Europe.
Many have moved to Ireland, including Apple Computer Inc., Stratus Computer Inc. and Ashton-Tate Corp.
