Peter Rawlins, a senior executive with a Lloyd's of London insurance underwriter, was named chief executive officer of London's Stock Exchange. 

The appointment, rumored for several weeks, comes as the exchange is examining far-reaching changes in its practices and regulations.
But the 38-year-old Mr. Rawlins' appointment isn't expected to stir any radically new strategies for the institution.
Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the exchange, is seen as its guiding force. 

Since 1985, Mr. Rawlins has been a director of Sturge Holdings PLC, an underwriting and stockbrokerage group, as well as managing director of it chief operating subsidiary R.W. Sturge & Co. Prior to holding these posts, Mr. Rawlins was a partner at Arthur Andersen & Co., the large accounting firm. 

Mr. Smith said Mr. Rawlins' knowledge of information technology should be a help in mapping the exchange's future.
Among other things, the exchange is considering changes in its handling of priced buy and sell orders, as well as shifts in rules for reporting large transactions. 

The exchange is being forced to spin off some of its information-services operations and open them up to greater competition.
The exchange is also coming to grips with significant changes in the way securites transactions are executed and settled, and is likely to computerize many functions that have been handled by clerks. 

Mr. Rawlins joins the exchange at a time of considerable internal upheaval, with international financial houses fighting some big British securities firms over equal access to London market facilities. 

Mr. Rawlins succeeds Jeffrey Knight, who held the senior operating post for the past decade, overseeing the Big Bang reforms that deregulated much of the securities business in London.
