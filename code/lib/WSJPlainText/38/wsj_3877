An editorial-page article by Jonathan Skinner, as published last Wednesday, was unclear in citing evidence that advertising for Individual Retirement Accounts was a potent factor in increasing saving.
The author and a colleague found that a third of all IRA households were eligible to contribute $4,000 annually but instead invested precisely $2,000, the limit most frequently advertised.
That limit in fact applied to households with only one income-earner -- thus the conclusion that the ads themselves, a function of the IRA program, were propelling incremental saving.
