New consumer credit extended by finance houses, building societies, other specialist-credit grantors and retailers totaled a seasonally adjusted record #3.99 billion ($6.46 billion) in August, up from #2.23 billion in July and #3.60 billion in August 1988, the British Central Statistical office reported. 

The CSO said the high level of new consumer credit reflects the usual surge in car sales that month, which hit a record one-month high in August.
It also reflects the use of bank credit cards, probably for holiday purposes. 

For the three months ended in August, new consumer-credit extended rose 3% to #10.68 billion from #10.33 billion for the previous three months.
