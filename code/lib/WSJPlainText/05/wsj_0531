Ferro Corp. said it will buy back as many as one million common shares.
The maker of chemical and industrial materials didn't say how much it would pay or when it would make the transactions. 

Ferro also said it would cancel the unused portion of a 1987 buy-back plan for administrative reasons.
The plan calls for the company to buy back 2,250,000 shares, which reflects a 3-for-2 stock split this year.
So far the company had bought back 1.6 million shares. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Ferro closed at $25.25, down 50 cents.
