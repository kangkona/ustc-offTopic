John Lehman's editorial-page article on the Pentagon as a haunted house omits the real roots of its ghost population ("In the Pentagon, the Undead Walk," Oct. 18).
The media's treatment of the Defense Department during the Vietnam War, the Carter administration's denigration of the military, and the public scapegoating of Lt. Col. Oliver North have all served to emasculate the poor souls who live there.
The resulting haunted house tends to reward followership, not leadership, it creates guilt about wearing the uniform, and raises doubt about having the will to fulfill the ghosts' role, i.e., to be able to win if called on. 

Perhaps the Halloween season is a good time for Congress to be looking at funding for some ghostbusting equipment.

Where does Mr. Lehman get off castigating Gen. George Marshall for muscling in on naval prerogatives?
Ever since the days of Alfred Thayer Mahan (U.S. naval officer and naval historian) and Teddy Roosevelt the Navy has been the service most favored by Washington officialdom.
Mr. Lehman overlooks the fact that the Navy possesses its own air force (the carrier fleet) and its own army (the Marines), which in turn has its own air force. 

Of course these turf battles are unseemly, wasteful and potentially dangerous and should be resolved in the interest of national security, but Mr. Lehman seems to be part of the problem rather than part of the answer.

I agree with Mr. Lehman 100%] 

Isn't this the same guy who resigned as Navy secretary because he couldn't get his 1,000-ship Navy? 

I personally do not want to hasten Mr. Lehman's demise, but I can see him figuring prominently in his own article.
