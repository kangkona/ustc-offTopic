Ultimate Corp. signed a letter of intent to market Hewlett-Packard Co. minicomputers, the companies said. 

Ultimate expects the 3 1/2-year agreement to generate $100 million in sales, but it wouldn't estimate profit. 

Under terms of the pact, Ultimate, a computer-systems concern, will market the full line of HP 9000 series 800 multipleuser minicomputers.
Hewlett-Packard is based in Palo Alto, Calif.
