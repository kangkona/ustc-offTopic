CRA Ltd. said it agreed to sell a 40% stake in its Howick coal mine in the state of New South Wales to Mitsubishi Development Pty. of Japan. 

The price wasn't disclosed.
The agreement is subject to government approval. 

RA acquired the Howick coal mine Oct. 20 when it bought British Petroleum Co. 's Australian coal interests for $275 million.
CRA said then that it was looking for a partner for the mine, which produces more than three million metric tons of coal a year. 

CRA is 49%-owned by RTZ Corp. of Britain.
