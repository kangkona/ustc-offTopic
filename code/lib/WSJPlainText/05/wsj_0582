Humana Inc. said it expects to receive about $27 million in federal income-tax refunds and interest from a court ruling on a tax dispute. 

The health-care company said it expects the refund to be included in the first quarter ending Nov. 30.
The refund is about $9 million.
Accrued interest on the refund was about $18 million as of Oct. 25. 

The refund stems from a court ruling that found certain payments by Humana subsidiaries to its insurance subsidiary during fiscal 1977 through 1979 were deductible as premiums for liability insurance.
