Upset over the use of what it says are its exclusive trademarks, Hells Angels Motorcycle Corp. is fighting back -- in court.
Concord New Horizons Corp., creators of a 1988 movie called Nam Angels, used the gang's name and trademarks without authorization, the not-for-profit corporation says in a complaint filed in federal court. 

Nam Angels depicts a group of the cycle gang's members on a mercenary mission to Viet Nam during the war years. 

In addition to being broadcast on cable television, the movie also is being distributed on videocassettes, the suit alleges in seeking unspecified damages.
Also named in the suit is Media Home Entertainment Inc. of Culver City, Calif., its parent, Heron Communications Inc., and Broadstar Television of Los Angeles, holders of the copyright on the movie. 

A Concord spokeswoman called the suit "unfounded" but declined to comment further. 

Besides being upset with the film's use of the Hells Angels name and logos, the Angels are angry with their depiction in the movie. 

"There is absolutely no way our board or membership would have approved the portrayal of the Hells Angels in this movie," said George Christie, president of the club's Ventura chapter. "Portrayal of our members as disloyal to each other is totally contrary to the most important values of our organization -- loyalty and trust." 

Nam Angels shows Angels fighting with each other and also depicts them as showing no remorse when a member is killed.
Both of these actions aren't characteristic of real Hells Angels, Mr. Christie said. 

Hells Angels was formed in 1948 and incorporated in 1966.
In addition to 26 chapters in the U.S., there are 40 chapters in foreign countries.
