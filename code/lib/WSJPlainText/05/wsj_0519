The Belgian consumer price index rose a provisional 0.1% in October from the previous month and was up 3.64% from October 1988, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said. 

The index, which uses a base of 1981 as 100, was calculated at 140.91 points in October, from 140.74 in September. 

Annual inflation rose to 3.64% in October from 3.55% in September. 

Belgium's inflation has been rising steadily for the past year, but the ministry said the latest rise is slower than gains in September and August.
