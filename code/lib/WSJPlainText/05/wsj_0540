General Electric Co. 's rail-car leasing unit completed the $178.5 million purchase of similar businesses from Leucadia National Corp. and Brae Corp., 74%-owned by Leucadia, the sellers said. 

The buyer was GE Capital Railcar Services, Chicago, a major owner of railway equipment and part of the GE Capital operations. 

Leucadia, New York, estimated it had a pre-tax gain on the transaction of $57 million, including its part of Brae's gain.
Because of tax-loss carry-forward, Leucadia said it expects to escape taxes on "a substantial portion of the gain." 

The estimated gain for Brae is $15 million, including a tax credit of $7 million, the sellers said. "The credit for income taxes is a result of having provided deferred income taxes applicable to the sold assets at the higher income tax rates in effect in prior years," the sellers said.
