The current account deficit on France's balance of payments narrowed to 1.48 billion French francs ($236.8 million) in August from a revised 2.1 billion francs in July, the Finance Ministry said. 

Previously, the July figure was estimated at a deficit of 613 million francs. 

Seasonally adjusted figures for August weren't available because of a recent strike that has disrupted the ministry's data collection.
