Karstadt AG said sales for its domestic group rose 4.6% in the first nine months of 1989 from a year earlier. 

The West German retailing group also said that the results of the first three quarters suggest it will meet its profit goal for the year.
Earnings at the department-store division, which generates the bulk of profit, should remain at least stable, while income at the mail-order and tourism units is likely to fall slightly from 1988, the company said. 

Karstadt didn't give any group sales or profit figures for the first nine months.
