A state trial judge in Illinois gave preliminary approval to a proposed settlement of a suit against a Bank of New York Co. unit, Irving Trust Co., over the interest rates on Irving's former One Wall Street Account money-market deposit accounts. 

Judge Albert Green, in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago, also recognized the suit, filed last May by Robert and Cynthia Langendorf, as a class action covering thousands of Irving customers.
The plaintiffs accused Irving of paying less interest than promised in a marketing brochure.
Irving maintained -- and still does -- that its actions were proper under its account agreements with customers. 

Under the proposed settlement, customers with valid claims -- to be submitted by Dec. 15 -- will receive "valuable bank services," such as credit cards with reduced finance charges, for two years.
Larry Drury, attorney for the plaintiffs, valued the settlement at between $6 million and $8 million.
A Bank of New York spokesman in Manhattan, Owen Brady, said, "That's the maximum, outside figure."
