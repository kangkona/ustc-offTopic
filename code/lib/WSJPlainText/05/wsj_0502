American Airlines will expand its trans-Atlantic service 30% beginning next year with six new daily flights between the U.S. and Europe, officials announced yesterday. 

American, a unit of AMR Corp., is the nation's largest airline. 

The new nonstop flights, starting next May, will include Chicago-Warsaw, Chicago-Helsinki, Miami-Madrid, Dallas-Barcelona, a second daily Chicago-Paris flight and a second daily Chicago-Manchester flight, the officials said. 

Chicago has the largest population of citizens of Polish heritage in any city outside Poland. 

With the new service, American will fly 161 flights a week to 17 European cities.
The additions solidify American's position as the third-largest U.S. transatlantic carrier, behind PanAm Corp. 's Pan American World Airways and Trans World Airlines.
