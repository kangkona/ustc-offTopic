Broad Inc. said it doubled its regular quarterly dividend to five cents a share from 2.5 cents on common, and to 4.5 cents a share 2.25 cents on Class B stock, payable Nov. 10 to holders of record Nov. 6. 

The financial services company emerged from the restructuring of Kaufman & Broad, Inc., which spun off its home-building subsidiary into Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. earlier this year and changed its name to Broad Inc. 

For the 10-month fiscal year ended Sept. 30, Chairman Eli Broad said he expected earnings results to approximate analysts' estimates, which the company said have been revised upward to 80 cents a share.
This would compare with an estimated loss of 3 cents a share for the comparable 10 months last year, which included restructuring costs.
