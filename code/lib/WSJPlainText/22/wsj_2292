Vitro S.A. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Anchor Glass Container Corp. for $21.25 a share, or $265 million, in the largest takeover of an American company by a Mexican concern. 

Anchor was relatively unaffected by Friday's market plunge, perhaps because Vitro was bidding for the company.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Anchor closed at $18.375, down $1.375. 

Yesterday's announcement of the accord culminated a two-month long battle for the Tampa, Fla., maker of bottles and other glass containers.
Anchor had been fighting Vitro's earlier $20-a-share tender offer and agreed to the sweetened bid after a special committee of Anchor's board put the company on the block.
Anchor said previously that it held talks with other parties, but no other bids emerged. 

Vitro, which already owns 1,430,000 Anchor shares, agreed to buy the remaining 12,470,000 shares outstanding through THR Corp., an indirect subsidiary of Vitro.
The Monterrey, Mexico, conglomerate also confirmed a previous announcement that it would acquire closely held Latchford Glass Co. of Huntington Park, Calif., in a separate transaction expected to close at the same time as the completion of the Anchor takeover.
The purchase price of the Latchford transaction wasn't disclosed. 

Vitro said Security Pacific National Bank committed $139 million to finance the purchase of Anchor and an affiliate of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. committed $155 million in a bridge loan to finance the Anchor and Latchford acquisitions. 

Ernesto Martens R.,Vitro's chief executive officer, said the company intends to keep Anchor based in Tampa and that the unit would be run independently by U.S. managers. 

Mr. Martens called the takeover a "unique strategic opportunity" for Vitro to become "a world player" in the glass-container industry.
Among other things, Vitro makes glass containers, flat glass and glass-making machinery.
