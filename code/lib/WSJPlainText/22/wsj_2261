J.P. Industries Inc. said it signed a definitive agreement to sell its Builders' Hardware Group to closely held Nalcor Inc. of Beverly Hills, Calif. 

Terms weren't disclosed, but a J.P. Industries spokesman said the amount J.P. Industries will get for the group is "a little better than expected by the marketplace, and the marketplace had been expecting $25 million to $30 million." 

The group consists of Weslock Corp. and JPI Modern Inc. J.P. Industries, which is based in Ann Arbor, Mich., said the sale completes a previously announced program to divest itself of its hardware and plumbing supplies operations.
The company's remaining business is the manufacture and sale of engine and transmissions products for industrial and transportation applications.
