Laidlaw Transportation Ltd. said it raised its stake in ADT Ltd. of Bermuda to 29.4% from 28%. 

A spokesman for Laidlaw declined to disclose the price the Toronto transportation and waste services concern paid for the additional shares, which he said were acquired "over the last couple of weeks." 

The spokesman said Laidlaw wouldn't increase its stake in ADT beyond 30% "without a great deal of thought" because of British takeover regulations that require a company acquiring more than 30% to extend an offer to the rest of the company's shareholders.
ADT, a security services and auctions company, trades on London's Stock Exchange. 

Laidlaw is 47%-controlled by Canadian Pacific Ltd., a Montreal transportation, resources and industrial holding concern.
