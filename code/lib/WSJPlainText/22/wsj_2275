The Communications Workers of America ratified a new regional contract and all but one of the local agreements with Bell Atlantic Corp. 

CWA's New Jersey Commercial local, which represents about 2,500 service representatives and marketing employees, rejected the tentative agreement.
Both the union and the regional telephone company said they were working together to resolve differences. 

The new three-year contracts, which replace ones that expired Aug. 5, cover 41,000 Bell Atlantic employees.
The ratification follows a 23-day strike against the Philadelphia-based company. 

Meanwhile, CWA and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers members remain on strike against Nynex Corp., the New York-based regional phone company.
The unions and the company last week agreed to mediation.
The CWA represents 40,000 Nynex workers and the IBEW represents 20,000 workers.
