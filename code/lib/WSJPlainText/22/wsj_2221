The market upheaval apparently hasn't triggered any cash crunch -- yet. 

Individual investors, investment firms and arbitragers who speculate in the stocks of takeover candidates can suffer liquidity and payment problems when stocks dive; those investors often borrow heavily to buy their holdings and use the stocks as collateral for loans.
But several large banks said yesterday they detected no signs of unusual demand for credit that would signal such difficulties. 

"We're seeing nothing out of the ordinary," said one official at a Top 10 bank. "That's good news, because we all swim in this water." Added another executive at a big bank: "We were all a little goosey over the weekend trying to forecast what would happen {Monday}, but it's been very quiet.
Now, as for tomorrow, hell, who knows?"
