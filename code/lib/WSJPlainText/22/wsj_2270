Maxus Energy Corp., Dallas, said it discovered a new oil field northeast of its previously discovered Intan Field in the southeast Sumatra area of Indonesia. 

Maxus said it didn't run a production test on the three discovery wells it drilled in the field, which is about 1.6 miles from the Intan Field, because the wells are similar to others drilled at its Intan and Widuri fields. 

However, Maxus said it believes the reserves in the field are about 10 million barrels of oil.
The Intan Field has estimated reserves of 50 million barrels and the Widuri Field has estimated reserves of 225 million barrels. 

Maxus, an independent oil and gas concern, is the operator and owns a 56% interest in the new field, called Northeast Intan.
Other interests are owned by BP Petroleum Development (SES) Ltd., C. Itoh Energy Co. Ltd., Deminex Sumatra OEL G.m.b.
H., Hispanoil (Sumatra) Production Ltd., Hudbay Oil (Indonesia) Ltd., Inpex Sumatra Co. Ltd., Lasmo Sumatra Ltd., Sunda Shell, TCR Sumat A.G. and Warrior Oil Co.
The production-sharing contract area is held with Pertamina, the Indonesian state oil company.
