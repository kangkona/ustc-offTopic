Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it reduced its rating on $281 million of senior and subordinated debt of this thrift holding company, to C from Ca, saying it believes bondholders will recover only "negligible principal." The agency said it confirmed American Continental's preferred stock rating at C. American Continental's thrift unit, Los Angeles-based Lincoln Savings & Loan Association, is in receivership and the parent company has filed for protection from creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. 

CENTRUST SAVINGS BANK (Miami) -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded its ratings on the subordinated debt of CenTrust to Caa from B-3.
The rating agency also reduced the ratings for long-term deposits to B-3 from Ba-3 and for preferred stock to Ca from Caa.
The rating agency said about $85 million in securities was affected.
The downgrades were prompted, Moody's said, by the continuing turmoil in the junk bond market and the suspension of dividends on CenTrust's preferred stock.
Moody's also said it believed the proposed sale of 63 CenTrust branches to Great Western Bank could, if completed, endanger the thrift's funding and market position.
