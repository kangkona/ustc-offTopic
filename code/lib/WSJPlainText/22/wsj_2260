Burmah Oil PLC, a British independent oil and specialty chemicals marketing concern, said SHV Holdings N.V. of the Netherlands has built up a 6.7% stake in the company. 

James Alexander, a Burmah spokesman, said SHV had previously owned "a little under 5%" of Burmah for about two years.
The Dutch company hadn't notified Burmah of its reason for increasing the stake, he said. 

SHV, which last year merged its North Sea oil and gas operations with those of Calor Group PLC, has been pegged by speculators as a possible suitor for Burmah Oil in recent weeks.
SHV also owns 40% of Calor. 

Burmah, which owns the Castrol brand of lubricant oils, reported a 17% rise in net income to #43.5 million ($68.3 million) in the first half.
