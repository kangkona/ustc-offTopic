Ambassador Paul Nitze's statement (Notable & Quotable, Sept. 20), "If you have a million people working for you, every bad thing that has one chance in a million of going wrong will go wrong at least once a year," is a pretty negative way of looking at things. 

Isn't it just as fair to say that if you have a million people working for you, every good thing that has one chance in a million of going right will go right at least once a year? 

Don't be such a pessimist, Mr. Ambassador.
