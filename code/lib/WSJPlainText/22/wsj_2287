LAC Minerals Ltd. said it agreed to buy 65% of Denver-based Bond International Gold Inc. for $10 a share, or $373.8 million. 

The stake in the gold-mining company is held by companies controlled by Australian financier Alan Bond, who has been selling assets to reduce debt. 

LAC, a gold-mining company, said the transaction is to close Nov. 21, subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Bond International closed unchanged at $8.75. 

The purchase helps LAC make up for a court decision earlier this year in which it lost a long legal battle with Toronto-based Corona Corp. for control of Canada's richest gold mine.
The Bond International stake would roughly double LAC's gold production and substantially reduce its average cost of producing gold. 

Bond International is expected to produce about 600,000 ounces of gold in the fiscal year ending June 30, of which roughly two-thirds would be attributable to LAC from the date the acquisition is completed.
LAC itself is expected to produce about 400,000 ounces this year. 

Last year, Bond International spent an average $204 to produce an ounce of gold at mines in North and South America and in Australia, significantly lower than LAC's own average cost of $260 an ounce.
Analysts say the real jewel in the Bond International crown is its 83% stake in Chile's El Indio mine, which they say had production costs of below $100 an ounce. 

A LAC spokesman said the company has "enough cash" to pay for the Bond International stake without borrowing. 

The spokesman said LAC has no intentions "right now" to further increase its stake in Bond International.
