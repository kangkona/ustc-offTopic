J.P. Morgan & Co. swung to a loss in the third quarter, while NCNB Corp. reported net income more than doubled, and Security Pacific Corp. net rose 10%. 

J.P. Morgan & Co. 

J.P. Morgan, as expected, posted a $1.82 billion net loss for the quarter, reflecting the New York bank's decision last month to add $2 billion to reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries. 

The reserve addition placed the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. among a few major U.S. banks that have covered nearly all their medium and long-term portfolios to less-developed countries with reserves. 

The latest quarter's loss equals $9.92 a share.
In the year-earlier quarter, Morgan earned $233.6 million, or $1.25 a share. 

George M. Salem, analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., called the results "mildly disappointing." Excluding the $2 billion provision and allowing for the taxes Morgan paid, earnings were about 65 cents a share, Mr. Salem said. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Morgan climbed $1.50 a share to $44.125. 

Net interest income sank 27% in the quarter to $254 million from $347 million.
The interest rate on short-term funds, which banks borrow to finance longer-term loans to customers, was "sharply higher," Morgan said. 

Morgan received $2 million of interest payments on its medium and long-term Brazilian loans; had they been accruing interest, net interest income would have been $35 million higher in the quarter, Morgan said.
Such loans to Argentina also remain classified as non-accruing, costing the bank $10 million of interest income in the third period. 

Income from sources other than interest climbed 12% to $414 million, reflecting higher corporate-finance and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities. "These increases were partly offset by lower trading-related" income, the bank said.
Non-interest expenses grew 16% to $496 million. 

NCNB Corp. 

NCNB Corp. 's net income more than doubled in the period, largely because of continued strong performance by the bank's Texas operations. 

The Charlotte, N.C., company said earnings rose to $143.6 million, or $1.45 a share, from $58.9 million, or 69 cents a share, a year earlier.
The latest quarter included a gain of $56.1 million, or 59 cents a share, related to the purchase of the remaining 51% of NCNB Texas National Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 

The strong performance, however, contrasted with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of NCNB's problem loans, particularly in the Southeast.
In the third quarter, nonperforming assets jumped to $474.1 million, or 1.43% of net loans and leases, from $232.8 million, or 1.13% in the second quarter.
Nonperformers totaled $230.8 million, or 1.27% in the year-ago third quarter.
Included in the increase in the most recent quarter is a $33 million loan, which NCNB said it "expects to be fully repaid, with no loss, early in the fourth quarter." 

The deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of 17% in NCNB's Southeast operations, as well as a 28% growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign.
The higher rates paid on deposits also helped squeeze NCNB's net interest margin in the Southeast to 3.38% from 3.80% a year earlier. 

In Big Board composite trading yesterday, NCNB jumped $3.50 a share, to $51.
Results were released after the market closed. 

NCNB Texas National, formed from the remnants of of the failed First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas, contributed $76.9 million to NCNB's bottom line in the third quarter.
NCNB said its third-quarter results reflect 100% of earnings of the Texas operation since Aug. 1. 

NCNB raised some $1.9 billion in new capital during the quarter to complete the NCNB Texas purchase, and to acquire several small failed thrifts to fill out its regional franchise.
Last week, the banking company said it purchased both Freedom Savings & Loan Association, Tampa, Fla., and University Federal Savings Association of San Antonio, Texas, for $169.4 million. 

In the first nine months, NCNB's net income climbed 65% to $310.9 million, or $3.30 a share, from $188.2 million, or $2.22 a share, a year earlier. 

Security Pacific Corp. 

Security Pacific's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter, but the Los Angeles bank holding company was still able to post a 10% increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans. 

Net rose to $185.1 million, or $1.55 a share, from $167.9 million, or $1.47 a share, a year earlier.
The company said the gain resulted mainly from a $54 million increase in net interest income, reflecting a 33% increase in real estate loans (mainly residential), and a 19% rise in consumer loans.
These high-yielding loans in effect replaced some low-yielding assets such as inter-bank loans, which were allowed to decrease.
As a result, Security Pacific's net interest margin fell only 13 basis points, a more mild decrease than some major banks outside California, which have been reporting more sluggish earnings. 

Security Pacific shares closed at $44.625, down 37.5 cents, in Big Board composite trading. 

The earnings represent a 0.89% return on assets for Security Pacific, and an 18.9% return on equity. 

The loan growth offset continuing real-estate loan losses in the depressed Arizona market.
Security Pacific reported a 33% increase in net credit losses for the quarter, to $109 million from $81.9 million in the year-ago period. 

Nonperforming loans grew slightly to $1.75 billion at Sept. 30, from $1.7 billion a year ago. 

Security Pacific's loan-loss provision was down 22%, or $30.4 million, because it added to its foreign-debt reserve the year before.
Non-interest income fell 6% in the quarter, mainly because of an unusual gain a year earlier from the sale of Hong Kong banking operations.
Non-interest expense grew only 4% in the period. 

For the nine months, net rose 17% to $548.9 million, or $4.67 a share, from $469.4 million, or $4.13 a share, a year earlier.
