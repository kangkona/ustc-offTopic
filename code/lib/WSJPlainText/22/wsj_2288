Dallas investor Harold Simmons says he hasn't decided to sell his Lockheed Corp. shares, after all. 

In a terse news release responding to an article yesterday in The Wall Street Journal, which credited a front-page interview story in the Sunday Los Angeles Daily News, Valhi Inc. said the quotes in the articles "do not accurately reflect Valhi's and Mr. Simmons's intentions" concerning their interests in Lockheed.
Through Valhi and its affiliates, Mr. Simmons holds a 10.43% stake in the aerospace and electronics concern, and his plans concerning Lockheed have been the subject of much speculation among securities analysts. 

In the Daily News story, Mr. Simmons was quoted as saying, among other things: "Actually, I wish I were out of Lockheed.
The defense industry seems to be getting more uncertain all the time.
So I'm a seller.
Put it in big black letters and underline it." 

Yesterday's statement by Valhi said the quotes "take out of context and paraphrase statements made by Mr. Simmons in jest at the conclusion of a lengthy interview." The true position is that Valhi and its affiliates, as they have said in public filings, "may increase, decrease or retain their Lockheed holdings" depending on a number of conditions. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Lockheed shares closed yesterday at $46.25 a share, off $1.75. 

Douglas R. Dowie, Daily News managing editor for news, said "the quotes in the Daily News were in context and were not in jest." The report of the interview, which was recorded, was "absolutely correct," he added. 

A spokesman for Mr. Simmons declined to elaborate on the Valhi statement, and said Mr. Simmons wouldn't be available to answer questions about his remarks to the Daily News.
