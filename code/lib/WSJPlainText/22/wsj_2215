Idle Thought 

To spend a carefree, idle day, 

When duty calls, to pay no heed, 

To while the precious hours away -- 

Character is what you need. 

-- May Richstone. 

Telecussed 

The guy who throws an intercept 

'Cause his receiver slips 

Should somehow be advised that we 

At home can read his lips. 

-- Dick Emmons.
