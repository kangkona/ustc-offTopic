The sudden "flight to quality" that triggered Friday's explosive bond-market rally was reversed yesterday in a "flight from quality" rout. 

The setback, in which Treasury bond prices plummeted, reflected a rebound in the stock market and profit-taking. 

"It was a pretty wild day.
Our markets were closely tied to the stock market," said Joel Kazis, manager of trading at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. "Friday's flight to quality was no longer needed once the stock market found its legs," he said. 

Some fixed-income investors had expected a further drop in stock prices after the nearly 200-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday.
That caused investors to flee stocks and buy high-quality Treasury bonds, which are safer than other types of securities.
But when stocks began to climb instead, prices of Treasury bonds declined. 

Contributing to the selling pressure were dispatches by several investment firms advising clients to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios.
Among the firms were Merrill Lynch & Co. and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 

The bond market seemed to ignore evidence that the Federal Reserve eased credit conditions slightly by allowing the federal funds rate to drift as low as 8 1/2%.
The closely watched rate on federal funds, or overnight loans between banks, slid to about 8 3/4% last week, down from its perceived target level of about 9%.
The rate is considered an early signal of changes in Fed policy.
Traders said yesterday's modest easing didn't stir much enthusiasm because it had been widely expected.
In fact, some economists contend that the latest easing started last week.
Others note that some investors were disappointed because they had expected a more aggressive easing. 

The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, ended about 1 3/4 points lower, or down about $17.50 for each $1,000 face amount.
The reversal was even more evident among shorter-term Treasury securities.
After Treasury bill rates plummeted as much as 0.70 percentage point on Friday, they gave back three-fourths of that amount yesterday.
The bond-equivalent yield on three-month Treasury bills, for example, was quoted late yesterday at 7.72%, compared with 7.16% Friday. 

Investment-grade corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds also fell. 

But prices of junk bonds, which were battered Friday in near standstill trading, rebounded to post small gains after a volatile trading session.
Junk bonds opened as much as four points lower but staged a modest comeback as stock prices firmed.
Some traders said the high-yield market was helped by active institutional buying.
In particular, they said, firms such as First Boston Corp. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels. 

"I think the willingness of securities companies to make markets for high-yield issues improved the sentiment for junk bonds," said John Lonski, an economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc. 

U.S. Treasury bonds were higher in overnight trading in Japan, which opened at about 7:30 p.m. EDT.
The benchmark 30-year bond, for example rose one point in early Japanese trading in reaction to a quick 600-point drop in the Tokyo stock market.
But as Japanese stocks rebounded, Treasurys retreated and ended just modestly higher. 

Many U.S. trading operations, wanting to keep a watchful eye on Japanese trading as an indication of where U.S. trading would begin, were fully staffed during the Tokyo trading session. 

"Most of the action was during the night session," said Michael Moore, trading manager at Continental Bank. 

Jay Goldinger, who often trades overnight for Capital Insight Inc., Beverly Hills, Calif., said trading in Tokyo was "very active" but highly volatile. "We went down 3/4 point in 10 minutes right before lunch, then after lunch we went up 3/4 point in 12 minutes," he said.
In Tokyo, trading is halted during lunchtime. 

Tokyo's market turned out to be a bad bellwether for U.S. trading.
When the market opened here, bonds prices fell as the stock market regained strength. 

The bond market's focus on stock activity was so strong yesterday that it overshadowed today's slate of economic data, which includes the government's report on August U.S. merchandise trade and September industrial production. 

Industrial production is expected to have declined 0.2%, according to a consensus of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.
The August trade deficit is expected to have widened to $9.1 billion from $7.58 billion in July.
A widening of that magnitude, said one New York trader, is "not a favorable number. . . . It could do damage to us." 

Meanwhile, agency supply is expected to weigh heavily on the market today when the Federal Home Loan Bank prices a $2.3 billion offering of one-year, three-year, five-year and 10-year maturities. 

Tomorrow, the Resolution Funding Corp. will provide details of its first bond issue, which is expected to total between $4 billion and $6 billion and carry a maturity greater than 20 years.
Resolution Funding is a division of Resolution Trust Corp., the new federal agency created to bail out the nation's troubled thrifts. 

And this week the Tennessee Valley Authority plans to price a $3 billion offering, its first public debt borrowing in 15 years. 

"There's lots of supply," the New York trader said. "We have a couple or three tough weeks coming." 

Treasury Securities 

Prices of Treasury bonds tumbled in moderate to active trading. 

The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was quoted late at a price of 101 19/32, compared with a closing price of 103 12/32 Friday.
The yield on the benchmark issue rose to 7.97% from 7.82%. 

The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 3/32 for a yield of 7.97%, compared with 101 9/32 to yield 7.84%. 

Short-term interest rates fell yesterday at the government's weekly Treasury bill auction.
The average discount rate on new three-month Treasury bills was 7.37%, the lowest since the average of 7.36% at the auction on Oct. 17, 1988.
The average discount rate was 7.42% on new six-month bills, the lowest since the average of 7.35% at the auction on July 31, 1989. 

Here are auction details: 

Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value.
Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.
The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year. 

Both issues are dated Oct. 19.
The 13-week bills mature Jan. 18, 1990, and the 26-week bills mature April 19, 1990.
Corporate Issues 

Investment-grade corporate bonds ended one to 1 1/2 point lower.
There were no new issues. 

Foreign Bonds 

Foreign bonds surged as the dollar weakened against most major currencies. 

Among benchmark issues: 

-- Japan's No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers screens at 96.15, up 1.17 point.
The yield was 5.245%. 

-- West Germany's 6 3/4% issue due June 1999 ended at 98.30, up 0.91 point to yield 6.99%. 

-- Britain's 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 ended 1 1/8 higher at 111 19/32 to yield 10.12%, while the 11 3/4% notes due 1991 rose 21/32 to 98 26/32 to yield 12.74%. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities 

Mortgage securities gave up most of Friday's gains as active issues ended 24/32 to 30/32 point lower. 

Dealers said morning activity was hectic as prices dropped in response to gains in the stock market and losses in Treasury securities, but trading slowed to moderate levels in the afternoon. 

Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for November delivery were quoted late yesterday at 98 4/32, down 30/32 from Friday; 9 1/2% securities were down 27/32 at 100 5/32; and 10% securities were at 102 2/32, off 24/32.
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9% securities were at 97 1/4, down 3/4.
On Friday, mortgage issues gained as much as 1 5/32. 

Late yesterday Ginnie Mae 9% securities were yielding 9.39% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note narrowed 0.01 percentage point to 1.42. 

Traders said there were some busy dealings in Freddie Mac and Federal National Mortgage Association securities because underwriters from last week's heavy slate of real estate mortgage investment conduit issues moved to gather collateral for new deals. 

Offsetting the Remic-related purchases were continued heavy sales by mortgage originators, which are producing increased amounts of fixed-rate mortgage-backed issues with lower rates. 

There was no new-issue activity in the derivative market. 

Municipals 

Rebounding stocks and weaker Treasury prices drove municipal bonds 1/4 to 3/4 point lower in late dealings. 

The session losses left municipal dollar bonds close to where they were before the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Friday prompted a capital markets rally. 

Trading was hectic during the morning, with players trying to gauge whether equities would continue Friday's free fall or stabilize after a brief spot of weakness.
Tax-exempts started the session flat to a touch higher on anticipation of further stock market erosion, but bond prices rapidly turned south as it became more clear that a repeat of the October 1987 crash wasn't at hand. 

Professionals dominated municipal trading throughout the session.
Traders said retail investors seemed to be hugging the sidelines until a measure of volatility is wrung out of the market. 

New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was off 3/4 at 98 1/2 bid, yielding 7.32%, up 0.07 percentage point from late Friday. 

Florida Board of Education's 7 1/4% issue of 2023 was 5/8 point weaker at 99 1/2 bid.
The 7 1/8% issue of Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority of New York, due 2019, was off 5/8 at 98 1/8 bid.
And Fairfax County, Va., Water Authority's 7 1/4% issue of 2027 was down 3/4 at 99 7/8 bid. 

Serial bond yields were up about 0.05 percentage point.
