Enron Corp., Houston, said the sale of preference units of its newly formed Enron NGL Partners L.P. master limited partnership subsidiary will result in an undetermined gain in the fourth quarter. 

In the year-ago quarter, the natural gas concern had net income of $25.2 million, or 34 cents a share, on revenue of about $1.46 billion.
Those results included a $2.7 million charge related to the retirement of debt. 

In a related move, Enron said it increased the number of the partnership's units it will offer to 6,930,000 from 5,500,000.
The old and revised numbers both include over-allotment provisions.
Enron said each unit will be priced in the $19-to-$21 range and will represent about 80% of the partnership equity. 

Net proceeds from the offering are expected to be close to $200 million.
Goldman, Sachs & Co., and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. are lead underwriters.
