Intel Corp. said it reached an agreement with Alliant Computer Systems Corp. to develop software standards for Intel's i860 microprocessor. 

The i860, introduced earlier this year, is Intel's entry in the crowded market for reduced instruction set computing, or RISC, computers.
Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., is the market leader for traditional microprocessors with its 8086 family that forms the heart of IBM-compatible personal computers. 

Under the agreement, Intel will invest $3 million to acquire a 4% stake in Alliant, a maker of minisupercomputers for scientists and engineers.
Alliant, based in Littleton, Mass., will license its parallel-computing technologies to Intel, providing users a way to let many i860 microprocessors in a single computer work on a problem simultaneously.
Alliant said it plans to use the microprocessor in future products.
It declined to discuss its plans for upgrading its current product line.
