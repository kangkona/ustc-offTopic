Chicago investor William Farley agreed to sell three divisions of Cluett Peabody & Co. for about $600 million to Bidermann S.A., a closely held clothing maker based in Paris. 

Shortly after completing the $1.56 billion acquisition of West Point-Pepperell Inc. in April, Mr. Farley's holding company, Farley Inc., said it was considering the sale of Cluett, a leading shirt maker and one of West Point-Pepperell's biggest units. 

Included in the sale are Cluett units that make men's shirts under the Arrow name, socks under the Gold Toe name and menswear through the Schoeneman division. 

The companies said the agreement is subject to Bidermann's receipt of financing and to regulatory and other approvals.
They said the sale is expected to be concluded by the end of November. 

Mr. Farley said the sale of three of Cluett's four main divisions plus other "anticipated" West Point-Pepperell asset sales by December, should bring in a total of about $700 million.
He didn't elaborate on other asset sales being considered. 

Mr. Farley followed a similar pattern when he acquired Northwest Industries Inc. and then sold much of its assets.
But he kept Fruit of the Loom Inc., the underwear maker that he still controls and serves as chairman and chief executive. 

Cluett was an independent company until West Point-Pepperell acquired it for $375 million in cash and stock in 1986.
In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1988, Cluett had operating profit of $37 million on sales of $757 million. 

Bidermann sells clothes under various labels, including Yves Saint Laurent and Bill Robinson for men and Ralph Lauren for women.
A spokesman said the company had sales of $400 million in 1988. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, West Point-Pepperell fell 25 cents to $53.875.
