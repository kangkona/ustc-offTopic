Golden West Financial Corp., riding above the turbulence that has troubled most of the thrift industry, posted a 16% increase of third-quarter earnings to $41.8 millon, or 66 cents a share.
The company earned $36 million, or 57 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. 

Herbert M. Sandler, chairman and chief executive officer of the Oakland, Calif., savings-and-loan holding company, credited the high number of loans added to the company's portfolio over the last 12 months for broadening its earning asset base and improving profit performance. 

However, the executive noted that slackening demand for new mortgages depressed new loan originations to $1 billion, 30% below the same period last year. 

In savings activity, Mr. Sandler said consumer deposits have enjoyed a steady increase throughout 1989, and topped $11 billion at quarter's end for the first time in the company's history.
Deposit growth amounted to $393 million, more than double the year-ago figure.
