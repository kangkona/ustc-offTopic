Arthur M. Goldberg said he extended his unsolicited tender offer of $32 a share tender offer, or $154.3 million, for Di Giorgio Corp. to Nov. 1. 

DIG Acquisition Corp., the New Jersey investor's acquisition vehicle, said that as of the close of business yesterday, 560,839 shares had been tendered.
Including the stake DIG already held, DIG holds a total of about 25% of Di Giorgio's shares on a fully diluted basis. 

The offer, which also includes common and preferred stock purchase rights, was to expire last night at midnight.
The new expiration date is the date on which DIG's financing commitments, which total about $240 million, are to expire.
DIG is a unit of DIG Holding Corp., a unit of Rose Partners L.P. Mr. Goldberg is the sole general partner in Rose Partners. 

In August, Di Giorgio, a San Francisco food products and building materials marketing and distribution company, rejected Mr. Goldberg's offer as inadequate. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Di Giorgio closed at $31.50 a share, down $1.75.
