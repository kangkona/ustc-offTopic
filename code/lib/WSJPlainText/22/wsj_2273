CMS Energy Corp., Jackson, Mich., said it has resumed the purchase of its common stock under a program approved by its directors in 1987. 

At the time of the original announcement, CMS said its board authorized the purchase of as many as five million of its shares.
A spokesman said 2.6 million shares have been purchased since then.
The company said it will buy additional shares "from time to time in the open market or in private transactions at prevailing market prices." 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, CMS Energy closed at $34.375 a share, down 62.5 cents, from the closing price of $37.375 a share on Thursday, before Friday's plunge. 

The utility company currently has about 82.1 million shares outstanding. 

Morgan Stanley & Co. will act as the exclusive broker for the repurchase.
