BMA Corp., Kansas City, Mo., said it's weighing "strategic alternatives," for its Business Men's Assurance Co. unit, and is contacting possible buyers of the life and health insurance operation. 

A BMA spokesman said "runaway medical costs" have made health insurance "a significant challenge," and margins also have been pinched by changes in the mix of life-insurance products consumers now demand.
The Business Men's Assurance unit represented about $288 million of the company's $488 million in 1988 revenue, and the unit's operating income was about $10 million, said the spokesman. 

BMA's investment banker, Alex.
Brown & Sons Inc., has been authorized to contact possible buyers for the unit.
