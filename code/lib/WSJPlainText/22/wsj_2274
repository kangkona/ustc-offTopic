Hughes Aircraft Co., a unit of General Motors Corp., said it agreed to purchase the Electro-Optics Technology division of Perkin-Elmer Corp. 

Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed.
But for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1988, the most recent period for which results were broken out, the Perkin-Elmer unit accounted for more than half the $145 million in sales recorded by the company's government systems sector. 

Perkin-Elmer, which is based in Norwalk, Conn., said the sale of the Danbury, Conn., unit is consistent with its restructuring strategy announced in April.
In addition to making electro-optical systems, the unit also makes laser warning receivers.
These are used aboard military helicopters to warn pilots that a laser weapon has been focused on them. 

Hughes of Los Angeles said the PerkinElmer unit's work complements efforts by its Electro-Optical and Data Systems group, which makes infrared sensors, military lasers and night vision equipment.
Hughes said it expects the sale to close by year end.
