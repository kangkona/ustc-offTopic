Omnicare Inc., which intends to expand its position in the medical and dental markets, said it acquired a cotton and gauze products division from closely held Sterile Products Corp. for $8.2 million. 

Omnicare said it expects the division to add "substantial sales volume and to make a positive contribution to our earnings in 1990 and beyond." 

In 1988 the Cincinnati company earned $3.1 million, or 32 cents a share, on revenue of $148.5 million. 

Omnicare said the division operates under the trade name ACCO and supplies the medical and dental markets.
The business, based in St. Louis, had sales of more than $14 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, Omnicare said.
