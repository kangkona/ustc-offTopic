A group of institutional investors in Telerate Inc. said that Dow Jones & Co. 's $18-a-share offer for the electronic financial information services company is "grossly inadequate." 

In a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group, which holds about 4.5 million Telerate shares, or about 4.7% of the shares outstanding, said " . . . at present none of us believes an offer for less than $25 per share would be fair and some believe that $25 is too low." The letter was dated Oct. 6. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Telerate shares closed yesterday at $18.875, down 75 cents a share. 

Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has launched an $18-a-share, or $576 million, tender offer to acquire the remaining Telerate shares outstanding; Dow Jones owns 67% of Telerate.
Telerate has rejected the offer, which expires Nov. 3. 

The group includes Putnam Cos. and various affiliates based in Boston; Wells Fargo Bank, San Francisco; the California Public Employees Retirement System, Sacramento, Calif., and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., Baltimore. 

Among other issues, the group's letter said it has "concerns as to whether Dow Jones's offer meets the applicable requirements of procedural fairness." 

A spokesman for Dow Jones said he hadn't seen the group's filing, but added, "obviously Dow Jones disagrees with their conclusions.
Our offer is to buy any and all shares tendered at $18 a share."
