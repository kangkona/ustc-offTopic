Memotec Data Inc. said it signed a definitive merger agreement with ISI Systems Inc. under which Memotec will acquire ISI for $20 (U.S.) a share, or about $130 million, in cash and securities. 

In American Stock Exchange composite trading, ISI closed up $3.125 at $18.625.
In Montreal Exchange trading, Memotec closed unchanged at 10.625 Canadian dollars (US$9.05). 

Memotec said under the agreement, ISI, a Braintree, Mass., provider of computer software and services to the insurance industry, will merge with a U.S. unit of Memotec created for that purpose.
Memotec is a Montreal-based maker of telecommunications products and provider of telecommunications and computer services. 

Memotec said the agreement calls for it to make a $20-a-share cash tender offer for all shares outstanding of ISI.
But it said Charles Johnston, ISI chairman and president, agreed to sell his 60% stake in ISI to Memotec upon completion of the tender offer for a combination of cash, Memotec stock and debentures.
Memotec said the tender offer is conditioned on, among other things, holders tendering at least 15% of the shares outstanding, other than the shares held by Mr. Johnston. 

ISI said its board has instructed management to accept inquiries from any others interested in making a bid.
ISI said it can withdraw from the merger agreement with Memotec if a better bid surfaces.
