Enjoying several blockbuster movie hits including "Batman," Los Angeles-based Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. reported earnings for the first quarter ended Aug. 31 of $5.8 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss. 

Sony Corp., which has offered to acquire the movie-production company, is seeking to free its top executives, Peter Guber and Jon Peters, from an exclusive agreement with Time Warner Inc. 's Warner Communications Inc. so they can run Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. 

Sony two weeks ago agreed to acquire Columbia for $3.4 billion, or $27 a share.
Warner sued Sony and Guber-Peters late last week; Sony and Guber-Peters have countersued, charging Warner with attempting to interfere in Sony's acquisition of the two companies. 

Guber-Peters's net income in the latest quarter compared with a net loss of $6.9 million, or 62 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
The company said revenue rose 138%, to $10.9 million from $4.6 million, reflecting the success of its movies "Gorillas in the Mist" and "Rainman," as well as the box-office smash "Batman."
