In an attempt to give new momentum to European Community plans for a single currency, EC government leaders are likely to agree to set a date for starting formal talks on amending the EC's founding Treaty of Rome. 

According to diplomatic sources in Brussels, most EC leaders agree that talks should begin in the second half of 1990, and will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in Strasbourg, France, on Dec. 8 and 9. 

The only strong opposition to changing the EC treaty comes from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who is opposed to creating a single EC currency.
But the process of convening the intergovernmental conference doesn't require unanimity. 

Setting a date to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself, but could be viewed as an important psychological push.
French President Francois Mitterrand fought to set a date for the conference during the EC summit in Madrid last June, but the move was scuttled because of opposition by Mrs. Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 

Diplomatic sources said Mr. Kohl may now agree to set a date for the conference to make it clear that West Germany is still committed to EC unity.
