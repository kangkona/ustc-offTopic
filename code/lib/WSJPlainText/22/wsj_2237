Congress has been critical of the Bush administration for not sending enough aid to Poland, so it is getting ready to send its own version of a CARE package.
Last month, the Senate voted to send a delegation of congressional staffers to Poland to assist its legislature, the Sejm, in democratic procedures.
Senator Pete Domenici calls this effort "the first gift of democracy." The Poles might do better to view it as a Trojan Horse.
It is the vast shadow government of 15,000 congressional staffers that helps create such legislative atrocities as the 1,376 page, 13-pound reconciliation bill that claimed to be the budget of the United States.
Maybe after the staffers explain their work to the Poles, they'd be willing to come back and do the same for the American people.
