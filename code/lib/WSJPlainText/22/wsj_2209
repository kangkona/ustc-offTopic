DPC Acquisition Partners, a hostile suitor for Dataproducts Corp., said it intends to launch a tender offer for the computer printer maker's common stock. 

DPC, a group led by the New York investment firm Crescott Inc., also said it plans to file preliminary materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding a shareholder solicitation to oust Dataproducts' board. 

DPC holds a 7.8% stake in Dataproducts and made a $15-a-share bid for the company in May, but Dataproducts management considered the $283.7 million proposal unacceptable.
A DPC spokesman declined to elaborate on the group's new plan. 

In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Dataproducts shares jumped 62.5 cents to close at $9.375. 

Dataproducts, which had been seeking a buyer for several months, announced a restructuring plan in September and took itself off the auction block.
The company's restructuring includes plans to split into three sectors, to phase out domestic printer manufacturing operations and to sell its New England subsidiary.
As part of the plan, Dataproducts announced a pact to sell $63 million of its real estate holdings to Trizec Properties Inc., a unit of Canada's Trizec Corp. 

Jack Davis, Dataproducts' president, chairman and chief executive officer, said the company "is at a loss to understand DPC's intentions." He called today's announcement "opportunistic and disruptive" and said the company intends to proceed with its restructuring.
