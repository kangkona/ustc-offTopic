In a possible prelude to the resumption of talks between Boeing Co. and striking Machinists union members, a federal mediator said representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow. 

"It could be a long meeting or it could be a short one," said Doug Hammond, the mediator, who called the agreement to meet a first step toward a resumption of negotiations. "We're encouraged that talks are scheduled again but beyond that, we have made no expression of expectations," a Boeing spokesman said. 

The Machinists union has rejected a three-year contract offer that would have provided a 10% wage increase over the life of the pact, plus some bonuses.
Currently, average pay for machinists is $13.39 an hour, Boeing said. 

Now in its 13th day, the strike has idled about 55,000 machinists and has started to delay delivery of some jetliners. 

With a strike fund of about $100 million, the union had said it was prepared for a long strike.
After the third week on strike, union members will begin receiving $100 a week from the fund. 

Work at Boeing continues with supervisors and other non-striking personnel manning the lines.
And at the company's Wichita, Kan., plant, about 2,400 of the 11,700 machinists still are working, Boeing said.
Under Kansas right-to-work laws, contracts cannot require workers to be union members.
Boeing has declined to say how many employees are working at its giant Renton, Wash., plant. 

Union officials couldn't be reached for comment.
