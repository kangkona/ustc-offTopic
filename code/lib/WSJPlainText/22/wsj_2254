BSN S.A., a leading French food group, said it agreed to acquire Birkel G.m.b.
H., a West German pasta maker.
The value of the acquisition wasn't disclosed. 

The move is in line with BSN's strategy of gradually building its share of the European pasta market through external growth.
BSN will initially acquire a 15% interest in Birkel, a closely held concern.
The French group has an agreement giving it the right to buy all the shares outstanding, and this could be completed within a few months, a BSN spokeswoman said. 

The takeover was submitted for approval by the West German cartel office, BSN said. 

Birkel is West Germany's second-biggest producer of pasta, with sales of 250 million marks ($133.4 million) in 1988.
It has 750 workers at three production units in southwest Germany, and is that nation's leading producer of pasta sauces. 

The acquisition strengthens BSN's position in the European pasta market.
The French group currently ranks second after Barilla Group of Italy, whose sales are chiefly in the Italian market.
