Skipper's Inc., Bellevue, Wash., said it signed a definitive merger agreement for a National Pizza Corp. unit to acquire the 90.6% of Skipper's Inc. it doesn't own for $11.50 a share, or about $28.1 million. 

NP Acquisition Co., a National Pizza unit, plans to begin a tender offer for Skipper's on Friday, conditioned on at least two-thirds of Skipper's shares being tendered.
Pittsburg, Kan.-based National Pizza said the transaction will be financed under its revolving credit agreement. 

In national over-the-counter trading, Skipper's shares rose 50 cents to $11. 

Skipper's said the merger will help finance remodeling and future growth. 

Skipper's previously turned down a $10-a-share proposal from National Pizza and Pizza Hut Inc. questioned whether the purchase would violate National Pizza's franchise agreements.
National Pizza said it settled its dispute with Pizza Hut, allowing it to make the purchase.
Also, Skipper's results began to turn around, permitting a higher offer, National Pizza said. 

For the 12 weeks ended Sept. 3, Skipper's had net income of $361,000, or 13 cents a share, compared with a net loss a year earlier.
Revenue was $19.9 million.
