NCR Corp. reported a 10% drop in third-quarter net income, citing intense competition that caused its gross profit margins to dip. 

Net income for the quarter fell to $93.1 million from $103.1 million, roughly what analysts had expected.
But per-share profit dropped only 2% to $1.23 a share from $1.26 a share, as the company continued its stock buy-back plan.
Average shares outstanding dropped to 75.8 million from 82.1 million.
Revenue fell 1% to $1.39 billion from $1.41 billion. 

The computer maker, which sells more than half its goods outside the U.S., also said the negative effect of a stronger U.S. dollar will "adversely affect" its fourth-quarter performance and "make it difficult" to better 1988 results. 

NCR said revenue declined both in the U.S. and overseas, reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets.
The company, however, said orders in the U.S. showed "good gains" during the latest quarter.
Analysts estimate those gains at 12% to 13%, a good part of it coming from large orders placed by a few of NCR's major customers. 

In addition to a general slowing of the computer industry, NCR, which sells automated teller machines and computerized cash registers, is also affected by the retail and financial sectors, "areas of the economy that have generally not been robust," notes Sanjiv G. Hingorani, an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc. 

These factors, combined with a strong dollar, should negatively affect the current quarter's results, NCR said.
In the year-earlier fourth quarter, NCR had profit of $149.6 million, or $1.85 a share, on revenue of $1.8 billion. 

Mr. Hingorani said he lowered his full-year estimates for 1989 to $5.35 a share from $5.50 a share.
Revenue projections were slashed to $6.03 billion from $6.20 billion.
Last year, NCR had net income of $439.3 million, or $5.33 a share, on $5.99 billion in revenue. 

For the nine months, the company's earnings fell 9% to $264.6 million, or $3.40 a share, from $289.7 million, or $3.49 a share.
Revenues declined 1% to $4.17 billion from $4.19 billion. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, NCR shares fell 75 cents to close at $57.
