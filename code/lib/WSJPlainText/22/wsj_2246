U.S. Banknote Co. said it again extended the expiration date of its $7-a-share tender offer for International Banknote Co. to Nov. 15. 

U.S. Banknote said it is in negotiations to sell "certain facilities," which it didn't name, to a third party, and it needs the extension to try to reach a definitive agreement on the sale.
U.S. Banknote said it believes the sale, if completed, apparently would satisfy antitrust issues raised by the U.S. Justice Department about U.S. Banknote's offer to buy International Banknote.
Both of the New York-based companies print stock certificates and currency. 

U.S. Banknote said "there can be no assurance" a sale agreement would be concluded.
It also said the tender offer would probably have to be extended further to complete financing arrangements.
U.S. Banknote said Citibank extended the expiration date of its commitment for senior secured financing to Nov. 15. 

The offer, made June 1, has been extended several times.
Closely held U.S. Banknote offered the $7 a share, or $126 million, for as many as 14.9 million shares, or 78.6%, of International Banknote's shares outstanding.
U.S. Banknote said that as of Oct. 13, 16.1 million shares, or about 84.3% of the fully diluted shares outstanding, had been tendered.
