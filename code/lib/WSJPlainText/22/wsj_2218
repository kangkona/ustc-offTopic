BSN Corp. said it will begin an offer tomorrow to exchange up to one million of its common shares and all of its $16.6 million in 7 3/4% convertible debentures due 2001 for a package of new debt and common stock warrants. 

Under terms of the offer, the sporting goods maker will swap $9 face amount of 9 1/4% subordinated notes due 1996 and one warrant for each common share.
Each warrant allows the holder to buy one BSN share for $10.75 a share at any time over the next seven years.
BSN currently has 4.6 million common shares outstanding. 

BSN also is offering $850 face amount of new notes and 64 common-stock warrants for each $1,000 face amount of its convertible debt outstanding. 

The company said it can redeem the warrants at its option for $1 each.
The offer isn't contingent on a certain amount of debt or stock being exchanged. 

BSN said it is making the offer to shrink its capital and increase shareholder value.
If all the bondholders and holders of one million common shares accept the offer, BSN will increase its debt by $9 million, but it also will recognize a $2 million gain from retiring the old debt, said Michael J. Blumenfeld, president. "We have sufficient cash flow to handle that," he said. 

The offers are scheduled to expire in mid to late November.
