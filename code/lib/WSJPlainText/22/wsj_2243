Hertz Corp. of Park Ridge, N.J., said it retained Merrill Lynch Capital Markets to sell its Hertz Equipment Rental Corp. unit. 

"There is no pressing need to sell the unit, but we are doing it so we can concentrate on our core business, renting automobiles in the U.S. and abroad," said William Slider, Hertz's executive vice president. "We are only going to sell at the right price." 

Hertz Equipment had operating profit before depreciation of $90 million on revenue of $150 million in 1988.
The closely held Hertz Corp. had annual revenue of close to $2 billion in 1988, of which $1.7 billion was contributed by its Hertz Rent A Car operations world-wide. 

Hertz Equipment is a major supplier of rental equipment in the U.S., France, Spain and the U.K.
It supplies commercial and industrial equipment including earth-moving, aerial, compaction and electrical equipment, compressors, cranes, forklifts and trucks.
