Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan has chosen Antonia Novello to be the next surgeon general, Bush administration officials said. 

If she is nominated by President Bush and confirmed by the Senate, Dr. Novello would succeed C. Everett Koop, who rattled liberals and conservatives alike with his outspoken views on a range of health issues. 

Dr. Novello, an expert on pediatric kidney diseases, is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.
She has also served on several task forces on acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 

Dr. Novello's office said she wouldn't talk with reporters, and it refused to release any information about her.
The newsletter Medicine & Health, which first disclosed her selection by Dr. Sullivan, said she is 44 years old and she studied at the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine.
