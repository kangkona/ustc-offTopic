Allegheny Ludlum Corp. expects to report third-quarter net of about $34 million, or $1.50 a share, down from $38.4 million, or $1.70 a share, a year earlier, Richard P. Simmons, chairman and chief executive officer, told institutional investors in New York. 

Sales for the Pittsburgh-based producer of specialty steels and other materials fell to about $265 million in the third quarter from $320.5 million a year earlier, he said. 

He said the third-quarter estimate indicates profit for the nine months of $4.65 a share, "almost equal to the full-year 1988 earnings" of $108.6 million, or $4.81 a share.
In the first nine months of 1988, net was $85 million, or $3.76 a share. 

Mr. Simmons said the third-quarter results reflect continued improvements in productivity and operating margins. 

He said capital spending next year will rise to about $45 million from about $35 million this year.
