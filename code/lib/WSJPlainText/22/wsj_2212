LIN Broadcasting Corp. said it won't take a position on a revised tender offer by McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. to buy LIN and has asked for clarification of the offer. 

The new offer, which seeks 50.3% of the cellular and broadcasting concern, is for $125 a share for 22 million LIN shares.
McCaw's revised tender offer would require McCaw to begin an auction process in July 1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of LIN. 

LIN is asking McCaw to clarify its tender offer, which challenges an agreement between BellSouth Corp. and LIN to merge their cellular-telephone businesses.
BellSouth has notified LIN that it would "shortly respond to the McCaw proposal in as full and effective a manner as is warranted." 

The LIN board said holders may be misled by the provision in the McCaw proposal that "guarantees" private market value after five years for the remaining shares.
McCaw has "no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain," the LIN board said.
The board added that McCaw would be able to control LIN's operations and could, "therefore, operate LIN in a manner which could diminish its private market value and attractiveness to a third-party purchaser in five years." 

In national over-the-counter trading, LIN closed at $104.75, down $2.75.
