West Germany's Green Party joined its ideological soulmates Jeremy Rifkin and the Christic Institute in the legal battle to ground the Atlantis shuttle and its plutonium-powered Galileo probe to Jupiter.
The anti-defense Greens wanted a Washington federal appeals court to block today's scheduled liftoff long enough for them to ask the World Court to "order" a permanent cancellation of the $1.5 billion flight.
A three-judge appeals panel yesterday refused to comply, though liberal Judge Pat Wald went out of her way to deny that this was a "frivolous" case.
Of course it was.
NASA should now sue for fines against all three politico-plaintiffs, foreign and domestic, for bringing this mischievous case.
