Environmental Systems Co. said it is restating its results to reduce its reported net income for the first nine months of its fiscal year after discovering it took tax credits that already had been taken last year. 

The Little Rock, Ark., hazardous-waste services company said the restatement will reduce its net for the nine months ended July 31 to $2.5 million, or 17 cents a share, from $3.7 million, or 26 cents a share.
Net for the third quarter, restated, is $1.6 million, or 10 cents a share.
The company previously reported net of $2.3 million, or 15 cents a share. 

The company said that for financial reporting purposes last year it took tax credits that will be recognized for tax purposes this year.
But because of confusion, it took those credits again in reporting its results through the first nine months.
Jack W. Forrest, Environmental Systems president and chief executive officer, said the change increases the company's effective tax rate to about 35% from 20%.
