Citing a $3.1 million provision for doubtful accounts, Dallas-based National Heritage Inc. posted a loss for its fourth quarter ended June 30. 

A unit of troubled Southmark Corp., the operator of nursing homes and retirement centers said it sustained a net loss of $1.6 million, or nine cents a share, compared with net income of $1.3 million, or eight cents a share, a year earlier.
Operating revenue rose 13% to $22.2 million from $19.7 million in the year-earlier quarter. 

The company said the $3.1 million reserve was created to reflect doubt about the collectability of receivables owed to National Heritage by some of the real estate partnerships it manages.
The company also said expenses incurred by the previous board and management in the recent contest for control were recognized primarily in the first quarter ended Sept. 30. 

National Heritage stock fell 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $1.375 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
