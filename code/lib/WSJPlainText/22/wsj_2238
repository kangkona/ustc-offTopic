Waterford Wedgwood PLC, a financially troubled Irish maker of fine crystal and Wedgwood china, reported that its pretax loss for the first six months widened to 10.6 million Irish punts ($14.9 million) from 5.8 million Irish punts a year earlier. 

The results for the half were worse than market expectations, which suggested an interim loss of around 10 million Irish punts.
In a sharply weaker London market yesterday, Waterford shares were down 15 pence at 50 pence (79 cents). 

The company reported a loss after taxation and minority interests of 14 million Irish punts, compared with a loss of 9.3 million Irish punts for the year-earlier period.
There weren't any extraordinary items. 

Sales for the total group rose 27% to 168.1 million Irish punts compared with 132.6 million Irish punts a year ago.
Waterford has decided against paying an interim dividend. 

Waterford said the appointment of a new management team and the signing of a comprehensive labor agreement are expected to enhance the company's long-term prospects.
