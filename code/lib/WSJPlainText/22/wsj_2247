Gitano Group Inc. said it agreed to buy 50% of Regatta Sport Ltd., a closely held apparel maker, with the assumption of $3 million of contingent debt. 

Under the terms of the contract, New York-based Gitano has the option to acquire the remaining 50% of Regatta, a maker of men's and women's clothes sold primarily in department stores, under certain conditions.
That 50% is now held by Clifford Parker, Regatta's president and chief executive officer, who will continue to manage Regatta's operations under Gitano.
In 1989, Regatta will have sales "in excess of $10 million" and will show a profit, Mr. Parker said. 

Gitano, which makes budget-priced apparel sold mainly through mass merchandisers like K mart and Wal-Mart, said the Regatta acquisition will enhance its strategy to expand into department stores.
This fall, Gitano began manufacturing moderately priced clothes aimed at department stores under the Gloria Vanderbilt trademark, which Gitano recently acquired.
