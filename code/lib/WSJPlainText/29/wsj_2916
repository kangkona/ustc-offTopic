The stock market broke this month's string of gains as profit-taking sent prices lower in moderate trading. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had posted gains in each of the month's six previous trading sessions and set five consecutive record highs in the process, fell 6.08 to 

Prices dropped shortly after the opening as participants returned from the Columbus Day and Yom Kippur holidays, and the market's effort to bounce back during the afternoon as it had done in the previous session proved short-lived. 

But stocks managed to recover from session lows in the final hour of trading with the help of futures-related program buying, which allowed traders to profit from price imbalances between the stock and stock-index futures markets. 

Trading activity, which slowed to a crawl Monday because of the holidays, remained light.
New York Stock Exchange volume amounted to 147,560,000 shares, compared with just 86.8 million in the previous session. 

"I just don't see much activity on either side," said Sandy Purdie, head of block trading at Robinson-Humphrey Co., Atlanta. "People are looking for some reason to do something and not finding any." 

The Dow industrials reached a peak about five points from 2800, as it did Monday, and analysts suggested that some participants were motivated to take profits as the average nears another century mark. 

"The round numbers always seem to present some type of hesitation," said Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntal & Co., who noted that the market had struggled earlier this year before surpassing lower numbers. 

Mr. Seagle described the latest decline as a "hesitation waltz until the main dance starts again" -- a renewed rally that should carry the Dow industrials beyond 2800 "before this week is out." 

The upward momentum generated as prices rallied over the past two weeks appears strong enough to prevent stocks from suffering any more than a "very minor" retreat, he said.
Through Monday, the Dow industrials had climbed nearly 5% from its Sept. 25 low of 2659.19.
