Edward I. Koch, soon to be New York City's ex-mayor, will be named a columnist for the New York Post, the city's racy daily tabloid newspaper, according to people close to the paper. 

Mr. Koch, who was defeated in the city's recent Democratic mayoral primary, is expected to accept an offer from Publisher Peter Kalikow and Editor Jerry Nachman to write a weekly column based on any topic he chooses.
Mr. Koch's salary couldn't be learned. 

Mr. Kalikow's office wouldn't comment but sources close to Mr. Kalikow said Mr. Koch has accepted the offer.
A spokesman for the mayor had no comment. 

The Post, as well as the New York Times, endorsed Mr. Koch over the eventual winner of the Democratic primary, Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins.
Mr. Koch already has accepted a position as visiting lecturer at the New York University Graduate School of Public Administration.
