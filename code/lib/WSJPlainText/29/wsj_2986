Thomson-CSF, Paris, reported that its consolidated net profit fell 7.6% in the first half of 1989 and said it expects full-year earnings to fall as well. 

The defense and electronics unit of the state-owned holding company Thomson S.A., said consolidated net profit eased to 1.49 billion francs (US$253 million) from 1.62 billion francs a year earlier on a 9.6% decline in revenue to 14.54 billion francs from 16.09 billion. 

Thomson-CSF said part of the sales decline reflected the sales of its Bronzavia-Air Equipement and ABG-Semca units, as well as the transfer of its aviation electronics activity to a joint unit with the state-owned Aerospatiale.
It said that after adjustment for these structural changes, first-half sales would have been down 2.7%, a dip it called hardly significant given irregular billing cycles for high-ticket items in its main defense business.
