Leszek Kolakowski's Sept. 1 editorial-page article "Forty-Four Years Late, Peace in Europe" was excellent.
But there is one point that doesn't agree with my experience. 

In May 1945, I was a 23-year-old German student.
While Mr. Kolakowski assumes that German anti-Nazis must have perceived Germany's defeat as a national catastrophe, I and all other German anti-Nazis I knew were joyous that the war had finally come to an end and that Hitler's dreams of subjugating Europe and possibly even the whole world had come to nothing.
Our desire to get rid of the Nazis was so strong that we gladly accepted air raids, the destruction of most German cities and occupation by the armies of the U.S., Britain and France. 

We were less enthusiastic about being occupied by the Soviets; however, we realized it was unavoidable after Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union, the destruction of so much of that country and the brutal treatment of its soldiers and civilians.
