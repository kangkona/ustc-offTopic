J.P. Morgan & Co. has disbanded an equities research unit, saying it didn't want to compete in the "highly saturated" arena of research focusing on stock fundamentals. 

Most of the six-person staff is being shifted to junk-bond research under Raymon De Oliveira within J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. However, one individual has been dismissed, according to a person familiar with the situation. 

Patrick J. Boland, formerly the managing director in charge of the unit, will be shifted to the staff of Robert G. Engel, group executive in charge of strategic planning. 

A spokesman said that Morgan's stock research in the future will concentrate on technical arbitrage and quantitative research.
Prior to being folded into J.P. Morgan Securities last year, the equities research staff was attached to J.P. Morgan Equities Inc., Morgan's former brokerage arm, where the staff prepared custom-tailored research and investment strategies for institutional clients. 

A Morgan spokesman said the breakup of the research unit had no strategic overtones regarding Morgan's pursuit of underwritings of public issues of corporate equities and debt. 

"This isn't a strategic move but rather a tactical one," the spokesman said. "It's a course correction." 

Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Board gave Morgan the go-ahead to become the first commmercial bank since the Depression to underwrite and deal in corporate debt to a limited extent through a securities affiliate.
At the time, the Fed indicated that in 1990 it will consider giving banks permission to underwrite and deal in corporate equities.
