President Bush announced his intention to nominate R. James Woolsey, a lawyer and former Carter administration official, as U.S. representative to the Negotiation on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. 

Mr. Woolsey, 48 years old, has been a partner in the Washington law firm of Shea & Gardner since 1979.
Between 1977 and 1979 he was undersecretary of the Navy.
In the early 1970s he served as general counsel to the Senate Armed Services Committee and as an adviser to the U.S. delegation to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in Helsinki and Vienna.
He was graduated from Stanford University, Oxford University and Yale Law School.
In his new post, Mr. Woolsey would carry the rank of ambassador. 

President Bush also announced yesterday his intention to nominate Richard Austin to be head of the General Services Administration, the federal government's chief purchasing arm.
Mr. Austin, 41 years old, has been acting administrator of the GSA since 1988 and served in several jobs at the agency before then. 

Previously, he was chairman and chief executive officer of the Sangamon County (Ill.) Board from 1978 to 1986, and was an aide to Illinois Gov. James Thompson from 1977 to 1980. 

Both nominations will require Senate confirmation.
