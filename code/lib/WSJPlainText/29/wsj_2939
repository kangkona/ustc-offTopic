International Business Machines Corp. introduced a low-end laser printer that could make it a significant factor in that rapidly growing market. 

The machine, which was expected, is 25% faster than the Hewlett-Packard Co. printer that dominates the low end of the market.
At a list price of $2,600, the IBM machine slightly undercuts Hewlett-Packard's price of $2,700 and presumably will be sold at discounts below Hewlett-Packard's street price of $1,600 to $1,700.
The IBM printer is smaller, slickly packaged and has about half as many parts as the Hewlett-Packard machine -- in an area where fewer parts typically means higher reliability. 

Market-research firms say Hewlett-Packard has more than half of the low end of the market, while IBM has almost nothing, so IBM will have an uphill fight.
Also, IBM is taking aim at a two-year-old machine, suggesting Hewlett-Packard may well respond with a new printer of its own at some point. 

In any case, IBM indicated it will market the machine vigorously.
IBM went so far as to have a Hewlett-Packard machine at a news briefing yesterday -- a move that would have once been heresy.
Its ad campaign will also be unusually aggressive; it will compare the IBM machine, point by point, against Hewlett-Packard's machine.
