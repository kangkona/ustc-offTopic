Airbus Industrie said Iberia Air Lines of Spain has made firm orders for eight long-range A340 commercial jetliners and has taken out options on another four. 

Airbus Industrie didn't indicate the value of the order, but French aircraft industry sources said the price tag on an A340 is approximately $95 million.
On this basis, the order would be valued at more than $1 billion if the options are converted into firm orders. 

The aircraft will be delivered beginning in 1994, the European consortium said, and will be powered by CFM56-56s engines being designed by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric Co. of Fairfield, Conn., and Snecma of France. 

Airbus is a consortium among Aerospatiale of France, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.
H. of West Germany, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain. 

Iberia has ordered 22 of the consortium's A320 short-to-medium range aircraft and has taken options on 10 more, and also has placed a commitment for eight A321s -- stretched versions of the A320 -- as well as 13 options. 

The latest order brings to 374 the number of commitments by 23 customers for the A340, including 136 firm orders.
The A340 is being developed with the A330 as a single program.
It is planned that the long-range four-engined A340 will enter service in 1993, and the twin-engined A330 one year later.
