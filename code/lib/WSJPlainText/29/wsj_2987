Swedish farm-engineering group Alfa Laval AB reported pretax profit for the first eight months surged 51% to 791 million kronor ($122 million) from 525 million kronor in the year-earlier period. 

Alfa Laval said sales increased 22% to 9.02 billion kronor from 7.38 billion kronor. 

The company said earnings per share rose 34% to 15.10 kronor from 11.30 kronor in the first eight months last year. 

Managing director Lars Kylberg said he expects Alfa Laval's positive development to continue throughout the year, but not at the same high rate as during the first eight months. 

Last year the company had a pretax profit of 1.05 billion kronor for the full year, but Kylberg said this year's pretax profit could reach 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion kronor. 

Alfa Laval said order bookings rose 18% to 10.98 billion kronor from 9.29 billion kronor.
