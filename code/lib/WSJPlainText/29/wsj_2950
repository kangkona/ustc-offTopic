Chrysler Corp. said its 1990 Chrysler Imperial, the car slated to lead the company's return to the luxury market, will carry a sticker price of $25,495. 

The No. 3 auto maker said it plans to build 10,000 of the four-door cars for the 1990 model year at its assembly plant here.
The Imperial will begin arriving on dealer lots next month. 

Chrysler, which held a formal ceremony here to launch the car, last produced four-door Imperials in 1975.
It discontinued production of the two-door Imperial in 1983, and said it has no plans to resume producing the two-door model. 

The new Imperial has a 109-inch wheelbase and features Chrysler's new 3.3 liter V-6 engine.
The car is equipped with antilock brakes and driver's side air bags. 

Imperial is one of several large cars Chrysler builds at the Belvidere plant.
Chrysler said yesterday it plans to produce 40,000 Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue cars, and between 30,000 and 40,000 Chrysler New Yorker Landau and Salon models here in the 1990 model year.
