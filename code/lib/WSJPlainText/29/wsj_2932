Carolina Power & Light Co., Raleigh, N.C., said an electrical fire forced the shutdown of its Harris nuclear power plant. 

The fire engulfed a generator, an electrical transformer, piping, wiring and ignited hydrogen used to cool piping.
The fire was confined to the electric-generating part of the plant and didn't affect the nuclear portion of the complex, a company spokesman said.
Firemen contained the blaze in about an hour and no one was injured, the company said. "We're not talking about a nuclear incident," he said. 

The spokesman declined to comment on whether the company's earnings would be affected, saying that a damage assessment hadn't yet been made.
The plant, which contributes about 9% of the utility's generating capacity, had been scheduled to be taken off line next week for regular refueling.
No delay is expected in that schedule and the company hopes to complete repairs in the eight to 10 weeks that refueling normally takes, the spokesman said. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Carolina Power closed yesterday at $43.625 a share, down 37.5 cents a share.
