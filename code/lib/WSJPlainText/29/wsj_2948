Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered U.S. corporate debt ratings more than twice as often as it raised them in the third quarter. 

The rating company said that not since the 1982 recession "has the relative frequency of downgrades been so great." Moody's said that it made 2.2 downgrades for every upgrade in the latest period.
In the 1988 period, the ratio was 1.7 to 1, while the ratio was 2.8 to 1 in 1982. 

Moody's added that it expects a rise in corporate defaults, "especially among highly leveraged speculative credits." It said that "the consensus forecasts of a sluggish economy and slower earnings growth do not brighten the outlook for credit quality." 

In the year's first nine months, Moody's downgraded 206 credit ratings involving $113.9 billion of debt; its 94 upgrades affected $63.9 billion of debt. 

The rate of special events -- that is, mergers, leveraged buy-outs, restructurings or litigation -- dropped slightly in the third quarter.
In dollar terms, the drop was greater as only $4.7 billion of bond ratings were cut because of a special event, compared with the first half's quarterly average of $17.4 billion.
A Moody's economist noted that the higher stock prices raised the cost of takeovers, hostile or otherwise.
