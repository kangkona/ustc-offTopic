Norton Co. said it is considering the sale or "other disposition" of all or part of its Eastman Christensen Co. unit, which provides services and makes products related to oil and gas drilling. 

The Worcester, Mass., maker of abrasives and drill bits said it is considering the sale because it wants to "enhance total shareholder value." 

In June, Norton purchased the remaining 50% stake of Eastman from its joint venture partner, Texas Eastern Corp., for $115 million. 

Norton bought the company, which is based in Salt Lake City, in light of Texas Eastern's then-pending merger with Panhandle Eastern Corp.
At that time, Norton said it would evaluate Eastman for future options.
