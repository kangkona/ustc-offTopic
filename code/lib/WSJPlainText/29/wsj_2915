Xylogics Inc., Burlington, Mass., said it reached an agreement under which Unisys Corp. will buy as much as $50 million of its computer systems over the next five years. 

Xylogics said Unisys will be buying its new Annex II terminal servers, a line it acquired from Encore Computer Corp. last December.
Unisys will resell the products as part of its own systems. 

Terminal servers are specialized computers designed to work as the hub of a network of terminals that communicate with each other and with other computer systems.
Blue Bell, Pa.-based Unisys, the nation's third-largest computer maker, frequently buys products from other vendors and integrates them in systems under its own name. 

Xylogics said the contract is the largest in its history.
For the nine months ended July 29, the maker of disk-drive controllers and data communications products posted profit of $1.6 million, or 57 cents a share, on revenue of $25.1 million.
