Accor S.A. said first-half profit rose 40% from a year ago, and added that its projection that net income for the year will exceed 575 million francs ($89.7 million) remains on target. 

The French hotel and restuarant group said that although first-half results of some of its units were below expectations, overall performance was satisfactory. 

Profit from current operations for the first-six months, after payments to minority interests, came in at 220.6 million francs, up from 157.3 million francs in the corresponding period of 1988.
The first-half earnings gain was based on a 13% rise in consolidated revenue to 7.18 billion francs from 6.36 billion francs a year ago. 

For 1988, Accor had net of 570.8 million francs, including 101.3 million francs of nonrecurring gains. 

Accor attributed its first-half performance to good growth of its European hotel operations, increased profitability of its restaurant activities in France and Spain, and increased turnover of its luncheon-voucher division.
