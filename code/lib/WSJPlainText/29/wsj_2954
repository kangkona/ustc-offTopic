London's International Financial Futures Exchange plans to lengthen trading hours and introduce an automated-trading system in an effort to remain Europe's busiest futures market. 

Unveiling its electronic automated-pit-trading system, Liffe said it plans to extend trading hours for financial-futures contracts to 11 hours a day from the current eight.
Longer hours begin Nov. 30, the day Liffe's new system is launched, with electronic trading starting when floor trading closes at 4:30 p.m. and continuing for 90 minutes.
The market also plans to open earlier eventually, with the electronic system operating from 7 a.m. until floor trading begins 90 minutes later. 

David Burton, Liffe chairman, said the longer opening hours and new system are intended to "meet the challenges from overseas in the next several years." In particular, many of the world's biggest futures and options exchanges are pressing ahead with new electronic-trading systems that could offer new competition. 

In Liffe's new system, traders sit in front of a computer screen that shows a simulated trading pit with boxes representing individual market makers.
Traders can post prices and trade with other firms by manipulating keys on their keyboards. 

The initial contract to be traded on the electronic system will be Liffe's Euromark futures contract.
In mid-December, Liffe plans to trade German government-bond futures contracts on the system.
