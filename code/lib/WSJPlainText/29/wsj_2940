The Internal Revenue Service plans to give victims of Hurricane Hugo more time to file their tax returns. 

The agency will delay until Jan. 16 the filing deadline for hurricane victims who had already received extensions for this year's returns until Oct. 16.
The additional extension will be granted to anyone unable to file because of the devastation from last month's hurricane.
Those seeking this extension must write "Hugo" at the top of the return. 

For hurricane victims whose normal filing deadline was Oct. 16, the payment deadline will be Nov. 15 and the filing deadline Jan. 16.
