Anchor Savings Bank said it reached a settlement with its resigning president and chief operating officer, William F. Schneider Jr. 

Mr. Schneider, with Anchor Savings Bank since 1962, resigned as the No. 2 executive last month, claiming a recent reorganization initiated by James M. Large Jr., the newly named chief executive officer, had reduced Mr. Schneider's duties and was in violation of his contract. 

Mr. Schneider had demanded almost $1 million in severance, amounting to three times his annual salary plus other benefits.
The settlement will pay him about half that sum when he formally resigns Nov. 18; the settlement is 18 months' regular base salary plus accrued retirement benefits.
He couldn't be reached to comment. 

The reorganization imposed by Mr. Large, an outsider who was named chairman in March, had the bank's mortgage-lending operation, which previously fell under the No. 2 executive's purview, report directly to the new chief executive.
Anchor Savings Bank has reported losses in recent quarters.
