(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

A COMPUTER NETWORK ENTERED the preserve of the Old Boy network in over-the-counter securities trading on Feb. 8, 1971.
Pink sheets, long used in the former bid-asked price quotation method, were mostly given the pink slip. 

The network, called Nasdaq, stood for "National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) Automated Quotations," the computer system ordered in 1968 by the NASD, the self-regulating body for the over-the-counter market.
Nasdaq, since 1971, has been largely replacing the old slow system, subject to abuses and errors, of brokers using prior-day data to haggle prices over the phone. 

"In effect, Nasdaq would bring the over-the-counter market up from under the counter, a nether reqion it still inhabited to a marked extent in April 1970," wrote; John Brooks in "The Go-Go Years." 

But the new network also created a long clash between Nasdaq and the New York, American and othe formal exachanges which worried that it would siphon business from them.
Also specialists feared that electronic trading might threaten their hallowed roles as exchange market makers. "There is a certain measure of antagonism between the exchanges and the NASD, but let them go at it, let the competition reign," said Edward I. O'Brien, president of the Securities Industry Association in August 1984. 

The April 1982 start of Nasdaq's National Market System (NMS) list of 40 "higher criteria" issues was the beginning of its hotter competition with quality issues on major markets.
NMS listings today account for 2,731 out of 4,986 Nasdaq-traded issues. 

Last year Nasdaq accounted for 18% of the value of securities traded in the U.S., up from 13.9% in 1974.
There are still some pink-sheet listings around, but not many.
