Swedish auto maker AB Volvo said it reached an agreement with Japanese car manufacturer Isuzu Motors Ltd. to cooperate on the Japanese truck market. 

"Volvo Trucks is the first foreign truck manufacturer to get a foothold on the Japanese market," said a Volvo Trucks spokesman.
The spokesman said Isuzu will sell trucks for Volvo.
During the first year Volvo expects to sell about 100 trucks, valued at 15 million yen ($105,374) each. 

"But we anticipate that the number will increase rapidly after a year of introduction," the Volvo spokesman said. 

Japan's truck market is the second biggest in the world, after the U.S. market.
