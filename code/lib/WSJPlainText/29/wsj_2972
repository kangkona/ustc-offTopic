In regard to George Melloan's Aug. 8 Business World column about pension-fund trustee activism in corporate governance: 

Given the huge size and diversity of pension funds, growth in shareholder value is inextricably linked to the successful management of Corporate America.
Pension-fund trustees can either take a do-nothing approach or we can accept the responsibility of being involved owners who work toward maximizing the long-term shareholder value for our beneficiaries. 

For me, the choice is obvious.
Sitting on the sidelines and "voting with our feet" are relics of a bygone era.
Today, any thoughtful analysis must consider active strategies to promote the growth of long-term value of our large holdings.
The most logical and effective means of doing so is to communicate in a non-confrontational manner with CEOs and corporate directors. 

Taking the passive, hands-off approach may unwittingly place shareholders' interests at risk.
For example, it is clear from the numerous oil-tanker accidents this year that insufficient attention has been paid to environmental protection.
On Sept. 7, New York City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin and I responded by calling on U.S. corporations to adopt the "Valdez Principles," a set of business guidelines promoted by environmental groups and socially responsible investment organizations.
I believe greater sensitivity to the environment will spare companies the more than $1 billion in costs Exxon has experienced. 

Moreover, it is clear that protecting the environment pays.
Just ask 3M Co., whose thoughtful environmental policies over the past decade saved it more than $200 million and made it more competitive world-wide.
Or ask ARCO, whose new gasoline EC-1 is being marketed solely on the basis of its environmental benefits.
In short, protecting the environment can give companies a competitive edge.
