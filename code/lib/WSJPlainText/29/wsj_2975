Medtronic Inc. said it will establish an employee stock ownership plan that, combined with other plans, will give officers and employees a 7% stake in the biomedical concern by the end of the plan's first year. 

The company said it will loan the ESOP $40 million by about Jan. 31, with stock purchases to follow. 

At Medtronics' current stock price, $40 million would purchase about 588,000 common shares.
The board also authorized purchases by Metronic of up to 750,000 common shares, a move intended to offset dilution.
On Sept. 30, the company had 26.9 million shares outstanding. 

In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Medtronic closed at $68.25, up $1.625. 

ESOPs offer companies a variety of tax breaks and provide a relatively inexpensive way to bolster employee retirement benefits.
Medtronic said the shares employees receive through the ESOP will replace its annual profit-sharing contributions. 

ESOP plans which put shares into the presumably friendly hands of employees have found increasing favor as anti-takeover devices lately.
A Medtronic spokesman said that while the company views the ESOP as a potential anti-takeover measure, the company isn't aware of any takeover attempts currently under way.
