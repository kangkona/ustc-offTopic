Oncogene Science Inc. said its genetic probe for diagnosing a type of leukemia was cleared for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration. 

The genetic probe detects a cancer-causing gene that has been activated to cause chronic myelogenous leukemia, a blood cancer that afflicts about 20,000 people and strikes 5,000 new patients each year. 

The new test is the first genetic probe for cancer to reach the market.
It is a predecessor of what may become a broad range of tests for genes that either cause cancer or predispose a person to developing cancer in the future.
