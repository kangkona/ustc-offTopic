Japan's Mitsui & Co. agreed to pay Iran nearly $1 billion in compensation for its withdrawing from a joint petrochemicals project at Bandar Khomeini, the official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported. 

Citing Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh, IRNA said Mitsui also agreed to provide as much as $500 million in long-term credits for Iranian imports of oil industry equipment.
And Mitsui has agreed to purchase $300 million of Iranian oil, IRNA added. 

Mitsui said in Tokyo earlier Monday that it was close to a settlement of the prolonged talks with Iran on pulling out of the Bandar Khomeini project, which was heavily damaged by Iraqi air raids during the Gulf war. 

Iran had reportedly been demanding $1.5 billion in compensation during the final stages of the negotiations, while Mitsui had offered $1 billion. 

The project was originally conceived as a joint venture between Iran and Japan about 16 years ago.
The plant was 85% complete when the Gulf war broke out in 1980.
The two sides set up Iran Japan Petrochemical Co. to run the project, but work was suspended in 1984 after repeated Iraqi attacks. 

IRNA said Mitsui will make the $1 billion compensation payment within three months. 

Mr. Aqazadeh said the accord with Mitsui "had in fact removed a stumbling block on the industrial and trade relations between Iran and Japan." 

Mr. Aqazadeh also said Iran hopes to continue work on the project with the assistance of other foreign companies.
One unit of the plant that has been under repair by Iranian workers will start operations in the spring of 1990, IRNA quoted Mr. Aqazadeh as saying.
