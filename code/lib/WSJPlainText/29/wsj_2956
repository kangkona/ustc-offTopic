Skipper's Inc. said that National Pizza Co. has expressed renewed interest in acquiring the operator of seafood restaurants. 

The company said it believes National Pizza would consider paying more than the $9.25 a share, or $25.6 million, it offered in a hostile tender offer that failed earlier this year.
Skipper's had opposed that bid, in part because it considered the price inadequate. 

But the company said it still believes that restrictions in National Pizza's franchise agreement with Pizza Hut Inc., a PepsiCo Inc. unit "appeared to prevent National Pizza or its subsidiaries from owning or controlling restaurant operations other than Pizza Hut." 

National Pizza, of Pittsburg, Kan., had filed suit against Pizza Hut during its bid for Skipper's earlier this year, but withdrew it when the pizza franchiser said it wouldn't immediately declare the company in violation of its franchise agreements.
National Pizza had been seeking other growth opportunities after it had been blocked in attempts to acquire additional Pizza Hut locations. 

National Pizza officials couldn't be reached for comment.
But in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it plans to begin "detailed negotiations" in a few days.
The company also said that general terms have been discussed and that Skipper's has indicated a willingness to enter into acquisition talks.
