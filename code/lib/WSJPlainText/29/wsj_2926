American Savings Bank, White Plains, N.Y., said it will report a third-quarter loss after taking an after-tax charge of $12.5 million for possible loan losses at its commercial lending subsidiary. 

American Savings said the additional charge is primarily related to possible loan losses on lease financing provided to a computer leasing company, Continental Information Systems Inc., that is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings. 

An American Savings official said without the charge it would have been profitable.
