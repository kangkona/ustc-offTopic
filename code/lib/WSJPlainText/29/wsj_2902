SunTrust Banks Inc., in what might serve as a portent for other Southeast banks, reported lower-than-expected earnings for the third quarter. 

The news sparked a sell-off in the bank's shares, which closed at $25.50 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, down $1. 

SunTrust said net income increased 6.7% to $82.8 million, or 64 cents a share, from $77.7 million, or 60 cents a share, a year earlier.
It said the results reflected growth in nonperforming loans and continued pressure on its margins. 

The results disappointed analysts, who had forecast earnings of 65 cents to 70 cents a share.
Many analysts looked upon SunTrust's numbers as a signal for what other Southeastern super-regionals will be reporting this week. 

"We're expecting to see margin pressure, and a rise in nonperformers across the board for the group," said Gerry O'Meara, an analyst with Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta.
The firm downgraded its ratings on both SunTrust and Barnett Banks Inc., Jacksonville, Fla., to hold from buy earlier this week.
It also cut its third-quarter earnings estimate for Barnett to $1.03 a share from $1.08. 

For the nine months, SunTrust earned $252.7 million, or $1.95 a share, up from $229.6 million, or $1.77 a share, in 

James C. Armstrong, a company spokesman, refused to characterize the quarter as disappointing or to speculate on the fourth quarter.
The third quarter "was obviously below analysts' expectations, and they're disppointed," he said. "But earnings did increase 7%, and we did show earnings improvements in all three of our markets in the nine-month period." 

SunTrust's nonperforming loans jumped $52 million in the quarter to $348 million.
