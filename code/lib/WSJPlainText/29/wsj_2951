Sony Corp. dropped as a major condition of its plan to acquire Guber Peters Entertainment Co. that the firm's top executives get out of five-year contracts with Time Warner Inc. 's Warner Communications unit. 

Sony has been negotiating with Warner to free Peter Guber and Jon Peters, the Hollywood producers, from an exclusive agreement to produce movies for Warner.
Executives at Warner have been angered by the negotiations to free the producers, a team with film interests including "Batman," "Rain Man," and "Gorillas in the Mist." 

Warner executives expressed surprise at Sony's move but declined official comment.
However, Warner's position has been that Messrs.
Guber and Peters have a binding agreement with the company. 

Two weeks ago, Sony agreed to acquire Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $3.4 billion.
It subsequently offered to acquire Guber Peters Entertainment for $200 million, so it could obtain the services of the two Hollywood film executives.
Sony has said it would give the two producers an equity stake in the studio and tie their compensation to increases in Columbia's value over five years. 

A Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week disclosed that the Guber Peters contract with Warner is one of the most attractive and lucrative arrangements between any Hollywood studio and movie producers.
