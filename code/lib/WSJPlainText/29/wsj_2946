The Federal Asset Disposition Association is being put up for sale without its lucrative government contracts for managing thrift assets. 

FADA, the former quasi-private arm of the thrift regulatory agency that disposes of the assets of failed thrifts, is a victim of the savings-and-loan bailout law.
The Resolution Trust Corp., the new federal agency created to dispose of assets, such as real estate, of failed thrifts, will take over those services. 

The RTC said yesterday that it will sell FADA's network of offices in five cities and its computer systems and office furnishings as well as transfer FADA's 275 employees to the buyer's company as part of the sale.
But, as expected, it won't sell the name, charter, capital stock or current management contracts, which are valued at roughly $30 million a year. 

The RTC is required to liquidate the FADA by Feb. 9, 1990.
