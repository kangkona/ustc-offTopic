McGill Manufacturing Co., a ball-bearing maker that has gotten a takeover proposal from Broadbeach Associates Inc., received a $72-a-share offer from AB SKF of Sweden. 

The offer by SKF, made in an advertisement in today's Wall Street Journal, values McGill at about $104 million.
SKF, a ball-bearing and automotive parts company, is seeking to acquire all of Valparaiso, Ind.-based McGill's shares outstanding. 

In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, McGill closed at $58, up $2.50. 

In August, Broadbeach, a Los Angeles-based investment and securities firm that holds a 7% stake in McGill, said it was willing to reconsider the terms of its $62-a-share, or $89 million, bid if McGill could demonstrate that additional values exist.
Broadbeach had said McGill ignored its original proposal and refused to meet with its representatives.
