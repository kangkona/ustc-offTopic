Eastern Europe is about to get its own version of Penthouse magazine. 

General Media International Ltd., the New York-based publisher of Penthouse and Omni magazines controlled by Bob Guccione, said it signed a licensing agreement with Zurich-based Hargitay Partners, which will publish a version of the adult male magazine in Hungary. 

Penthouse executives said the edition, which is expected to be launched next year, will feature less explicit photos than those published in the U.S. and other editions of the magazine. 

Playboy magazine, published by Chicago-based Playboy Enterprises Inc., is also considering a similar licensing arrangement, according to industry sources.
Playboy officials couldn't be reached for comment.
Specific terms of the licensing pact with Hargitay weren't disclosed. 

In most magazine licensing arrangements, U.S. publishers are paid a licensing fee for use of their names in a foreign country but hold no equity in the publication.
Many U.S. publishers, such as Hearst Corp. and Conde Nast Publications Inc., license their magazines throughout Western Europe and Asia.
Playboy has 12 international editions, while Penthouse has 13 world-wide editions, including Australia, Japan, West Germany and Greece.
