Jackpot Enterprises Inc. posted a 25% drop in net income for the fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30, to $924,000, or 18 cents a share, despite a 7.6% increase in revenue to $10.1 million. 

The company, which operates non-casino slot machines, acknowleged that earnings "did not meet previously announced expectations." 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Jackpot shares tumbled $2.25 to close at $13.875. 

In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Jackpot had net income of $1.2 million, or 25 cents a share, on revenue of $9.4 million.
Per-share numbers were restated for a 5% stock dividend distributed in August.
Jackpot blamed the profit drop on higher medical costs for employees and increased costs of $670,000 for renting machine locations. 

The increase in rent costs, coupled with costs of employee wages and benefits, are expected to hurt earnings for the current nine-month period, resulting in per-share earnings below the 78 cents recorded in the first nine months of fiscal 1989, Jackpot said.
Revenue is expected to be higher than the $27.3 million for the nine months ended March 31, 

For the year ended June 30, net income rose 11% to $5 million, or 96 cents a share, from $4.5 million, or 86 cents a share, a year earlier.
Year-earlier net income included a gain of $423,000 from an accounting change.
Revenue rose 34% to $37.5 million from $27.9 million. 

In a letter to shareholders, Jackpot management said the company is "going through a substantial transition," as it embarks on an expansion program.
The company said it expects to complete its first acquisition of a slot casino, with 175 machines, on Nov. 1.
It is also negotiating to acquire a larger casino in Southern Nevada, with more than 500 gambling devices, for more than $10 million.
