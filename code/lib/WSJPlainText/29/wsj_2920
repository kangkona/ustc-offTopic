Artra Group said a three-step recapitalization by its Lori Corp. unit will cut Lori's annual interest expense by $3 million and save Lori $2 million annually in preferred dividends.
Artra owns 68.1% of Lori, which makes and distributes jewelry. 

Artra, in Northfield, Ill., said the recapitalization will increase Lori's equity to about $29 million, from $7 million.
In the initial phase of the recapitalization, now complete, Artra said Lori's R.N. Koch subsidiary purchased $8 million par value of its $30 million outstanding 12 3/4% senior notes, due in 1995.
Artra said the move will yield Artra a nonrecurring gain of about $3 million this year and $550,000 in annual interest savings. 

In the second phase, Artra will exchange $19.1 million of Lori's notes and 7,459 Lori Series C preferred shares with a carrying value of about $17 million into new shares of Lori commmon stock.
In the third phase Artra will offer its shareholders rights to purchase Lori common shares.
