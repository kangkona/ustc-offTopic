Contel Corp. said it signed a letter of intent to acquire Telos Corp. for $65 million. 

Telos provides computer software design, development and consulting services for U.S. defense and space programs and some commercial applications. 

Atlanta-based Contel is hoping the proposed acquisition will give the company a competitive edge in serving government customers and expanding its federal systems business, which provides government agencies with life-cycle management of integrated telecommunications and information systems networks. 

Charles Wohlstetter, Contel's chairman, said Telos would help "particularly in the design and development of Ada software, which is becoming the standard computer language among government agencies." 

For the year ended March 31, Telos, based in Santa Monica, Calif., posted profit of $3.9 million on sales of $116 million. 

Telos's chairman, president and cofounder, Lin Conger, described Contel as an "excellent merger partner." Mr. Conger said he expects the transaction to be completed by year end.
