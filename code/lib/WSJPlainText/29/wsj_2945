Members of the Air Line Pilots Association voted to continue paying benefits to striking Eastern Airlines pilots, buying time for the embattled union in its seven-month-old walkout against the Texas Air Corp. unit. 

The vote, by pilots at other carriers represented by ALPA, will effectively give Eastern pilots time to fight the carrier's plans in bankruptcy court and in Congress, although they have had little success in either forum thus far. 

About 2,300 Eastern pilots still refuse to cross the machinists' union picket line, down from the 3,400 who initially refused to work when the strike began March 4.
ALPA, which represents about 40,000 pilots at 44 carriers, said a majority of the ballots returned supported continuing benefits, but it wouldn't say how many pilots voted. 

ALPA assesses pilots as much as $400 a month for the special Eastern strike fund.
The vote "removes an uncertainty and enables us to press on with our activities." said an ALPA spokesman. 

One of those activities is heavy-duty lobbying on Capitol Hill.
In their fight against management, Eastern pilots are pinning their hopes on a bill to establish a three-member commission to investigate the labor dispute at Eastern.
That bill, which Transportation Secretary Skinner opposes, could come up for a vote as early as tomorrow.
