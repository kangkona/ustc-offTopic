Bun Rap 

Hamburgers have gone upscale 

With names sublime, satiric; 

To get a good old-fashioned one 

You call for a generic. 

-- Ralph Shaffer. 

Pot Luck 

Lotteries are truly obscene 

In the sums that they are paying, 

And that is the very reason 

That we keep playing and playing. 

-- Arnold J. Zarett.
