IDB Communications Group Inc. said in Los Angeles that it completed the acquisition of Cici Inc., the international services division of Atlanta-based Contel Corp., for about $21 million. 

Concurrent with the acquisition, IDB, a supplier of satellite transmission services for radio, television and data/voice communications, said it formed a data/voice transmission services division, called IDB International, that combines IDB's international business with Cici's existing clients and services.
Cici provides international transmission services for the data/voice and television marketplace. 

The new international division will add nearly $20 million in annual revenue in 1990, said Jeffrey Sudikoff, IDB's chairman and chief executive officer.
James Kolsrud, president of Cici, will serve as president of IDB International, whose headquarters will be in Rockville, Md.
