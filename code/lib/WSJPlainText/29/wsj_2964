Three executives for casino owner and developer Donald Trump's Atlantic City operations died when their helicopter crashed on a highway near Lacey Township, N.J. 

They were Stephen Hyde, 43-year-old chief executive officer of Trump Organization's three operations in Atlantic City, Trump Taj Mahal President Mark Grossinger Etess, 38, and Jonathan Benanav, 33, Trump Plaza executive vice president. 

A Trump spokeswoman said the helicopter was chartered from Paramount Aviation, based in Erma, N.J.
The cause of the crash wasn't immediately known. 

The three men were returning from a New York City news conference where they had announced a boxing match at the Trump Plaza casino hotel. 

Mr. Trump issued the following statement: "These were three fabulous young men in the prime of their lives.
No better human beings ever existed.
We are deeply saddened by this devastating tragedy and our hearts go out to their families." 

Mr. Hyde, who worked in Atlantic City since 1981, and was formerly an executive at the Golden Nugget and Sands casino hotels, was considered particularly valuable to Trump Organization. "Steve Hyde was the most important ingredient in Donald Trump's success in Atlantic City," said Marvin Roffman, a casino analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott. 

Mr. Etess was responsible for the Taj Mahal, a casino-hotel scheduled to open April 1.
Mr. Etess's family operated the Grossinger Hotel and Country Club in the Catskills. 

The helicopter's pilot and an unidentified fifth passenger were also killed in the crash, according to reports.
