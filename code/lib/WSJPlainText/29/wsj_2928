USX Corp. 's board adopted a poison-pill plan as an anti-takeover measure, effective yesterday. 

The move indicates that investor Carl Icahn and Charles A. Corry, USX chairman, were unable to reach an understanding Friday.
The meeting was prompted by news that Mr. Icahn had increased his stake in the giant Pittsburgh-based steel and energy concern to 13.06% from 11.4% and was studying the feasibility of a buy-out or combination for USX. 

Mr. Icahn hadn't any comment on the anti-takeover measure, a shareholder rights' plan. 

Under the plan, if any individual or group acquires a 15% or more stake, each right not owned by the group would entitle the holder to buy, at the right's current exercise price, common stock with a value of twice the right's exercise price. 

The plan states that if any person or group accumulates a 15% stake, or the company is involved in a merger or other combination, or sells 50% or more of its assets or earning power, each right would entitle the holder to buy, at the right's exercise price, stock twice the value of the right's exercise price.
