Merrill Lynch & Co., New York, acquired eight retail brokerage offices from Kidder, Peabody & Co. Terms weren't disclosed. 

Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. plans to take over the Kidder offices, seven in Florida and one in Puerto Rico, while retaining the offices' 134 Kidder financial consultants and about 100 other staff members, a Merrill spokesman said. 

The acquisition increases Merrill's presence to 68 offices in Florida, with its heavy population of retirees and fixed-income recipients, more offices than in any other state.
The transaction boosts Merrill's nationwide total to 480 offices.
Kidder, 80%-owned by a General Electric Co. subsidiary, will be left with 44 branch offices, 10 satellite offices and about 1,400 brokers.
A Kidder statement said the eight offices being sold provide less than 3% of the firm's total revenue.
