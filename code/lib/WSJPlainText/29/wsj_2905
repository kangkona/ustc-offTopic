International Multifoods Corp. said it is talking with several prospective buyers for its Mister Donut franchise chain. 

A spokeswoman for the Minneapolis food company declined to identify the prospective purchasers, but said discussions have been under way with more than three possible buyers since early this summer. 

International Multifoods has owned the 34-year-old donut chain since 1970.
It has 486 franchises in 29 Eastern and Midwestern states and 87 franchises in Canada.
The chain is the second largest franchise donut-sales operation in North America with annual sales of $156 million. 

The spokeswoman said International Multifoods decided to open talks on the sale of the chain because it has been narrowing its focus to making and distributing food-service products. 

No price for the chain has been set, the spokeswoman said.
She said the company expects to decide on whether to sell the chain, and who will buy it, by year end.
