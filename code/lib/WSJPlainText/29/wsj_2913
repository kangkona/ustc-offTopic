Valhi Inc., a holding company controlled by investor Harold C. Simmons, is seeking to acquire NL Industries Inc. shares it doesn't already own in a stock swap valued at about $575 million. 

Valhi, which currently holds 66% of NL, offered to swap 1.5 shares of its stock for each of the 22 million NL shares it doesn't own.
NL has about 66 million shares outstanding. 

Despite Mr. Simmons' controlling stake in NL, approval of the merger isn't a foregone conclusion.
The wealthy Dallas investor has struggled for more than two years to restructure the company to his liking.
But many of his initiatives were blocked by outside directors, who retained the right to approve or veto merger and acquisition proposals under the agreement that allowed Mr. Simmons to gain control of the company. 

Mr. Simmons finally managed to get shareholder approval in December to spin off the company's oil-services operations as a separate company.
That set the stage for Mr. Simmon's proposal to merge with NL, which consists primarily of a specialty chemical operations Mr. Simmons would like.
The merger proposal was made in a letter to NL. 

J. Landis Martin, president and chief executive officer of NL, said the company's board will consider the proposal.
He added that any merger with Valhi will require, among other things, a fairness opinion from an investment banking firm and an affirmative vote by a majority of NL's minority shareholders. 

In its letter to NL, Valhi said the proposed swap ratio reflects the relative market value of both companies.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Valhi closed at $17.875, unchanged from Monday; NL closed at $23.75, up 12.5 cents.
