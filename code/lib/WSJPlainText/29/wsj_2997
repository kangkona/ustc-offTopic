Devon Energy Corp. said it completed the $9 million purchase of additional coal-seam-gas holdings in the Northeast Blanco unit of the San Juan Basin in northwest New Mexico. 

The acquisition could increase Devon's natural-gas reserves by 30%, the company said.
The energy concern said it acquired the holdings from a closely held non-affiliate, which it didn't identify.
