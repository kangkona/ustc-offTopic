Southeastern Asset Management Inc., a Memphis, Tenn., investment advisory firm, said it may talk to third parties regarding certain restructuring transactions involving Ecolab Inc., a St. Paul, Minn., cleaning and sanitizing concern. 

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Southeastern, which holds 12.01% of Ecolab's common shares outstanding, said that it has been contacted by one or more third parties wishing to discuss restructuring transactions, other than a change of management or control of Ecolab. 

In the SEC filing, Southeastern said it may talk to such third parties and "may be more active or assertive" than it has been in its contacts with Ecolab management. 

It noted that it plans to adhere to its investment philosophy regarding its Ecolab holdings and "has no present intention to seek control" of the company. "Southeastern will not initiate any acquisition or buy-out proposal with third parties or with management of any company, including the issuer," it added. 

In St. Paul, an Ecolab official said Southeastern "has been a large shareholder for some period, and we've been in contact with them.
They've been a constructive and supportive investor in the past." He declined to elaborate, as did an official at Southeastern. 

According to the filing, Southeastern holds 3,288,387 Ecolab common shares, or 12.01%.
It bought 426,100 shares from Aug. 15 to Oct. 5 for $27.08 to $32.16 each, the filing said. 

Yesterday, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Ecolab common closed at $30.625, up 87.5 cents, on volume of 357,700 shares.
