Mediobanca SpA has acquired a 23% stake in Istituto Finanziario Industriale, the Agnelli family holding company that controls a 39% stake in auto maker Fiat SpA. 

The transaction, valued at 303.5 billion lire ($219.3 million) makes Mediobanca the second-largest shareholder in Turin-based IFI -- but the shareholding is reportedly a temporary one. 

The Agnelli family, in part through a limited partnership company called Giovanni Agnelli & Co., had until now controlled all of IFI's ordinary shares.
IFI's preferred shares, which have voting rights only at extraordinary shareholders' meetings, are publicly traded. 

Giovanni Agnelli & Co. sold the shares to help raise financing for the July purchase of Galbani SpA, a leading Italian food company, by IFIL Finanziaria di Partecipazioni SpA.
IFIL, which is controlled by IFI, paid 2.241 trillion lire for the food concern, and about 300 billion lire of the purchase price was lent by Giovanni Agnelli & Co. 

IFI officials couldn't be reached for comment, but IFI's managing director, Umberto Agnelli, told the Italian news agency ANSA yesterday that "we don't consider Mediobanca a permanent shareholder." He added that "Giovanni Agnelli & Co. will make every effort to regain possession of those shares." 

IFI's preferred shares nonetheless plunged on the Milan stock exchange yesterday to 25,300 lire ($18.28), down 890 lire.
Consob, the Milan stock exchange regulatory commission, has asked for further information about the transaction from both parties. 

The transaction took place over the summer, but was made public only this week when Mediobanca released its annual report ahead of its shareholders meeting later this month.
The report said the bank bought the shares "conditionally," but provided no further explanation.
