Star Banc Corp., Cincinnati, said its board adopted a shareholder rights plan as a defense against hostile takeover bids. 

Star said its board declared a dividend of one right on each common share outstanding, payable Oct. 27 to stock of record Oct. 20.
Each share issued after Oct. 20 also will have one right attached. 

The rights plan could be triggered by any one of several developments including an announcement that a person or group acquired 20% or more of Star's common shares outstanding. 

Each right entitles the holder to purchase, at an exercise price of $100, 1 1/100 of a share of newly issued Series A preferred stock with a value equal to $200.
The rights of the hostile party, however, wouldn't be triggered. 

Star, which has 15 banking units, said the action wasn't taken in response to any specific effort to acquire the company and isn't intended to thwart bids that are considered fair and in the best interests of the company and shareholders.
