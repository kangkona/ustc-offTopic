Air Products & Chemicals Inc. said it and a joint venture partner will build and operate an anti-pollution facility for Northern Indiana Public Service Co.
The partner is a U.S. subsidiary of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Tokyo. 

Air Products, based in Allentown, Pa., said the flue gas desulfurization facility, which the joint venture will own, will require a $150 million investment over three years, including operating costs during that period. 

The joint venture, named Pure Air, will then provide services under contract for an additional 17 years to Northern Indiana Public Service's Bailly generating station near Gary, Ind.
Northern Indiana Public Service, based in Hammond, Ind., is a unit of Nipsco Industries Inc. 

The project is eligible for $63 million in support from the Department of Energy, pending completion of negotiations.
