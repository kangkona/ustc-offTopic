General Motors Corp. 's Chevrolet-Pontiac-GM of Canada Group said it formed a new unit to market to non-automotive manufacturers engine blocks and parts made by the group and other GM operations. 

The group currently sells about $250 million of engine blocks a year to original-equipment manufacturers, mainly in the marine industry.
A spokeswoman said the goal is to double that amount within five years, partly by aggressively pursuing business in areas such as specialty vehicles, irrigation and power generation. 

Donovan F. Downham, former general director of engine and component sales, planning and marketing for the group, has been named general director of the new unit.
The unit will include about a dozen people but will have access to the group's operations and engineering staffs.
