Manuela Hoelterhoff's Sept. 22 Leisure & Arts piece, "City Woman Hammers Baby Snakes," is a perfect example of how transplanted city folk earn the ridicule of their rural neighbors.
Making peanut-butter sandwiches on demand is hardly the best way to discourage raccoons -- they're probably inviting their friends to share the bounty.
Raccoons are clever devils, and they'll continue to be destructive if it brings such generous rewards. 

On the other hand, her much-abused snakes are highly beneficial, happily ridding her homestead of all sorts of unwanted bugs.
Harmless snakes found indoors should be simply picked up and placed outside, allowing both parties to resume their normal activities. 

I won't say anything about the wisdom of gardening in an all-white outfit, but a couple of hungry skunks would help solve her slug problem.
She probably wouldn't like those either.
