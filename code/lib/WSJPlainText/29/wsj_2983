American Healthcare Management Inc. said a federal bankruptcy judge here confirmed its internal plan of reorganization. 

Under terms of the restructuring, the hospital management concern's bank creditors will receive 50.5% of the company's stock outstanding, unsecured creditors will receive 42.5% and existing shareholders will get the remaining 7%.
Creditors will also receive a note for $180 million, while the rest of the company's debt outstanding, about $155 million, will be converted to equity or otherwise canceled, said Ralph Kuhns, senior vice president and treasurer. 

This marks the second time this year an American Healthcare restructuring has been approved by the court.
In July, the court approved a plan funded by Bain Capital, a unit of Bain & Co. of Boston and Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, a unit of Merrill Lynch & Co.
But the transaction subsequently fell through as the company's operations continued to deteriorate. 

That plan would have paid off all of the company's debt, with bank creditors getting 69.9 cents for each dollar owed, holders of subordinated unsecured debt 42.5 cents and other unsecured creditors 48 cents.
Bain and Merrill Lynch also were to receive all of the company's common stock in exchange for preferred shares valued at 94 cents for each existing common share.
