House and Senate leaders said it was becoming increasingly difficult to devise a streamlined $14.1 billion deficit-reduction bill that would postpone the fight over capital-gains taxes. 

The main stumbling block to budget talks, which are to continue today, remains President Bush's drive to reduce the tax on capital gains. 

Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) has proposed stripping the massive deficit-reduction bill of provisions that wouldn't reduce the budget deficit in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
Currently, it is laden with an array of revenue-losing measures.
Mr. Mitchell wants the Republicans to agree to remove a capital-gains tax cut, which is in the House bill passed last week, from the Senate bill.
In return, Republicans want to be assured of a speedy separate vote on the issue. 

But many procedural problems remain. "The time to strip the bill down was before we enacted it," House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) said after meeting with other congressional leaders. "It is now a practical problem." 

Sen. Mitchell acknowledged the Senate may have to begin debating the full deficit-reduction bill as it now stands, perhaps as early as tomorrow. 

In any case, final passage of the bill in time to avoid across-the-board spending cuts next week is nearly out of the question, congressional leaders said, "It would be extremely remote and very difficult to accomplish," Mr. Mitchell said. 

In the meantime, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater dismissed the entire effort. "We believe the capital-gains provision should be a part of the . . . bill," he said. "We urge that it be included." 

"It appears that the White House is intent on torpedoing these discussions," Sen. Mitchell responded.
