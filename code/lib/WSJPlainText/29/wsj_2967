Horn & Hardart Co. completed a $50 million private placement of two-year senior secured notes due Oct. 6, 1991. 

The initial rate on the notes is 1.5 percentage points over the London interbank offered rate.
The rate will increase 0.25 point each quarter beginning in the third quarter of the financing. 

Horn & Hardart, which has direct-marketing and restaurant businesses, plans to use about $20 million of proceeds to buy back the ownership interests in five parcels of New York City property. 

Horn & Hardart sold and leased back the properties in the 1970s.
The company plans to sell the properties soon, but Michael Sherman, senior vice president, declined to identify any potential buyers.
Mr. Sherman did say that Horn & Hardart expects to receive a price for the properties "substantially in excess" of the $20 million financing. 

The company will use $30 million of note proceeds to refinance about $20 million of short-term debt and for working capital.
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. managed the note offering. 

In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Horn & Hardart shares closed unchanged at $7.125.
