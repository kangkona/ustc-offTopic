Crown Resources Corp. said it reached a definitive agreement to acquire the Gold Texas Resources Ltd. shares it doesn't already own. 

Under the proposed agreement, Gold Texas holders will receive 1.43 Crown shares for each of the 1.1 million Gold Texas shares not owned by Crown, which already owns 65%. 

The arrangement is subject to approval by the Supreme Court of British Columbia province, Crown said.
Gold Texas is based in Vancouver, British Columbia, and Crown Resources is based in Denver.
Both are mining concerns.
