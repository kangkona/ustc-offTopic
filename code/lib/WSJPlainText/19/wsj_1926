Dow Chemical Co. said third-quarter net income slipped 6.8% from a record year-ago quarter.
The decline broke a streak of 10 quarters in which Dow posted earnings increases. 

Dow's third-quarter net fell to $589 million, or $3.29 a share, from $632 million, or $3.36 a share, a year ago.
Sales in the latest quarter rose 2% to $4.25 billion from $4.15 billion a year earlier. 

Dow closed at $94.625 a share, up 75 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

A spokeswoman said Dow is comfortable with Wall Street expectations that full-year earnings will total about $14.60 a share, compared with last year's record net of $2.4 billion, or $12.76 a share.
But that signal on full-year profit casts doubt on whether Dow will improve on its year-ago fourth-quarter net of $3.44 a share, or $635 million.
Dow would earn $14.85 a share for the year if it equaled that year-ago fourth-quarter performance. 

Dow officials were signaling that the company would earn less than $15 a share this year even before they announced in July a plan to acquire 67% of Marion Laboratories Inc.
That acquisition could further dilute earnings per share this year, the company spokeswoman said.
Dow hasn't said exactly what impact the Marion acquisition will have on 1989 earnings. 

Dow blamed the third-quarter earnings drop on several factors, including softer prices for polyethylene and other basic chemicals, a slower U.S. economy and a stronger dollar, which made Dow's exports from the U.S. more expensive to overseas customers.
Another problem was a 7% increase in operating costs at a time when revenue was rising by only 2%. 

For the first nine months of the year, Dow earned $2.06 billion, or $11.41 a share, up 17% from $1.76 billion, or $9.32 a share, a year ago.
Sales for the latest nine months rose 7.7% to $13.34 billion from $12.38 billion in the year-ago period.
