Cincinnati Microwave Inc. said it introduced two radar detectors. 

One unit, called the Escort, uses a new digital signal-processing technology to detect radar signals much sooner than was previously possible, the company said.
The other, called the Solo, is battery operated and is the first high-performance radar detector that doesn't need a power cord, the company said.
