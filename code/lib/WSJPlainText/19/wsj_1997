Blinder International Enterprises Inc., the parent of beleaguered penny-stockbroker Blinder, Robinson & Co., said its shareholders approved a previously announced name change to Intercontinental Enterprises Inc. 

"The parent company is diversifying into other industries around the world," said president Meyer Blinder in explaining the name change. "Everytime we talked about Blinder International, {people} thought it was the brokerage house." Mr. Blinder said the change wasn't related to the brokerage's recent troubles, which have included sharp declines in earnings, run-ins with the securities regulators and lawsuits by former customers. 

The company said it expects the name change to take effect within a week.
