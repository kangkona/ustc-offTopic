Japanese investors, reassured by Monday's strong rally on Wall Street, erased most of that day's losses on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
But analysts said the rebound didn't remove the cautious mood from the market. 

In London, stocks closed lower in volatile trading as an opening rally was obliterated by worse-than-expected U.S. trade figures.
Paris shares had a similar reaction, but most other European bourses posted gains, as did all major Asian and Pacific stock markets. 

Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 stocks jumped 527.39 points to close at 34996.08.
The rise came a day after the year's biggest drop on Monday, when the Nikkei fell 647.33, or 1.8%, in response to Friday's 6.9% plunge on Wall Street. 

In early trading Wednesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index rose 19.30 points to 35015.38. 

On Tuesday, the broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index of issues listed in the first section, which fell 45.66 Monday, rose 41.76, or 1.61%, to 2642.64.
Trading was relatively thin at an estimated 650 million shares, though brisker than Monday's 526 million.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 821-201, with 103 unchanged. 

"We're back to square one," said Simon Smithson, an analyst in Japan for Kleinwort Benson International Inc. 

Japanese domestic institutions, including trust banks and investment management firms, that had been on the sidelines during Monday's fall were back in the market, analysts said.
Foreign investors reportedly started off selling but later joined in the buying. 

The Tokyo rally seemed to confirm the view, frequently expressed in Japan in the past few days, that the drop in New York was a local problem related to merger and acquisition activity in the U.S. 

"This time we don't really have to worry about Tokyo," said an official at Daiwa Securities Co. "Nothing has changed fundamentally in the Tokyo market." 

But even though Tokyo appears unharmed by recent market volatility, analysts and traders say there are still a few concerns on the horizon.
In particular, Japanese investors will be keeping a wary eye on Wall Street to see whether Monday's 88.12-point rally holds up as fresh U.S. economic data are released. 

"People are placing small bets.
There's no huge buying," said Stephen Hill, head of equity sales at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd. in Tokyo. "Really brave views right now would be foolhardy." 

Yesterday's buyers favored real estate, construction and other large-capitalization issues, reflecting the fact that many Tokyo investors now feel safer with domestically oriented stocks, analysts said. 

They also are concerned about the persistent strength of the dollar against the yen, as a weaker yen leads to higher import prices in Japan and adds to domestic inflationary pressures. 

Currency concerns also weigh heavily on interest rate-sensitive stocks such as banking and other financial issues because of fears that Japanese interest rates might have to rise to keep the dollar in check. 

Among steel shares, NKK rose 19 to 705 yen ($4.97) a share, and Nippon Steel gained 17 to 735.
Construction shares that gained included Shimizu, which rose 130 to 2,080.
In the real estate sector, Mitsui Real Estate Development was up 100 at 2,760, and Mitsubishi Estate gained 80 to 2,360. 

London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 27.9 points to 2135.5.
It was down more than 40 points a half-hour before the close, marking a 61.5-point turnaround from its high, reached in the first 15 minutes of trading.
The narrower Financial Times 30-share index fell 29.6 to 1730.7.
Volume was an active 643.3 million shares, about double the recent levels but down from 959.3 million the previous day, which U.K. traders have dubbed "Manic Monday." 

Prices opened strongly on the basis of Monday's Wall Street rally and yesterday's gains in Tokyo.
But the advance faltered as index-options traders and investors jittery about the U.K. economic outlook took over.
The unexpectedly wide U.S. August trade deficit of $10.77 billion hit an already jittery U.K. market in midafternoon. 

Michael Hicks, who manages sales and trading for brokerage concern Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, said: "It's a nervous market.
It was all over the place.
If you bought, you wish you hadn't, and if you sold, you wish you hadn't." He said the current market "is all about sentiment, and the sentiment in London is 90% anxiety and worry." Britain's economic fundamentals, he said, "don't look very bright." 

Dealers said London showed signs of calming in midafternoon after Wall Street avoided sharp losses despite the trade report, but a wave of futures-related selling later in the session sent buyers back to the sidelines.
Still, some sectors found buying interest after being actively sold in recent weeks. 

Merchant banks were stronger across the board.
Morgan Grenfell, which has been mentioned in takeover rumors, rose 20 to 392 pence ($6.18) a share.
S.G. Warburg, a rumored target of some European banking concerns, finished 22 higher at 400.
Hambros rose 5 to 204, and Schroders rose 25 to #12.75. 

On the corporate front, Ford Motor announced that it raised its stake in U.K. luxury car maker Jaguar to 10.4% from 5%.
Jaguar shares jumped 23 before easing to close at 654, up 6. 

Amstrad, a British computer hardware and communications equipment maker, eased 4 to 47.
It announced a 52% plunge in pretax profit for the latest year. 

Brewery stocks were firm to higher on talk of early bargain-hunting, but most ended below their peaks.
Bass ended up 3 higher at 966, Guinness closed at 589, down 7, and Scottish & Newcastle dropped 11 to 359, but Whitbread Class A shares rose 17 to 363.
Dealers said there was late talk of a Whitbread sale of brewing operations to Scottish & Newcastle. 

The most active shares were major blue-chips, particularly oils and utilities such as British Gas and British Telecommunications.
Traders attributed the action in them largely to defensive positioning in a volatile market.
British Gas finished at 197, down 2, on 13 million shares, British Petroleum fell 8 to 291 on 9.4 million shares, and British Telecom was 4 lower at 261 on turnover of 10 million shares.
Cable & Wireless fell 20 to 478. 

Also in active trading, British Steel fell 1 to 124 as 20 million shares changed hands.
Racal Electric, which traded 11 million shares, declined 12 to 218. 

In other European markets, share prices closed sharply higher in Frankfurt and Zurich and posted moderate rises in Stockholm, Amsterdam and Milan.
Paris closed lower, and most Brussels shares were unable to trade for a second consecutive day because of technical problems.
South African gold stocks closed higher. 

Elsewhere, share prices rebounded in Hong Kong, Sydney, Singapore, Wellington, Taipei, Manila and Seoul.
In Hong Kong, Sydney and Singapore -- the largest of those exchanges -- stocks recovered one-third to one-half of the ground they lost in Monday's plunge, with major market indexes posting gains of 3.6% to 4.4%. 

Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.
To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
The percentage change is since year-end.
