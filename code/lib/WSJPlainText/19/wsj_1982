StatesWest Airlines said it submitted an offer to the directors of Mesa Airlines to acquire the Farmington, N.M., carrier. 

Except to characterize its offer as "fair and generous and in the best interests of Mesa shareholders," StatesWest declined to discuss details of its proposal.
It also asked Mesa to keep the proposal confidential.
A Mesa official confirmed receipt of the offer and said directors would meet to consider it. 

Last week, Mesa rejected a proposal by StatesWest to acquire it or merge. 

StatesWest has a 7.25% stake in Mesa, which operates 20 twin-engine and two single-engine turboprops among 42 cities in New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming, Colorado and Texas. 

StatesWest operates four twin-engine turboprop aircraft, connecting 10 cities in California, Arizona and Nevada.
The carrier hasn't yet turned a profit.
