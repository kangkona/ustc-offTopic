Olin Corp. said third-quarter net income rose 26% on the strength of its chemical business. 

Net was $24 million, or $1.15 a share, up from $19 million, or 90 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose 7.4% to $580 million from $540 million. 

Olin said its chemical segment had profit of $22 million, up from $15 million a year ago, largely because of gains in electrochemicals such as caustic soda.
The company said the gains were tied to volume increases and higher prices.
The market for electrochemicals include the paper, water-purification and textile industries. 

The chemical segment had a $6 million gain on the sale of ammonia and urea businesses, which was offset by a $6 million charge for future environmental expenditures.
Profit in Olin's defense and ammunition segment rose to $8 million from $7 million.
The metals segment, hurt by a strike, had break-even results, against $3 million a year ago. 

In the first nine months, net rose 21% to $93 million, or $4.52 a share, from $77 million, or $3.62 a share a year ago.
Sales rose 13% to $1.91 billion from $1.69 billion. 

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Olin closed at $58.50 a share, down 25 cents.
