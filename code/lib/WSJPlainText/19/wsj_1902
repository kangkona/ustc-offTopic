Great American Bank said its board approved the formation of a holding company enabling the savings bank to pursue nontraditional banking activities under a new federal law. 

The proposed holding company's primary purpose would be to allow Great American to continue engaging in real estate development activities, it said.
Those activities generated $26.1 million in operating profit last year. 

But according to Great American, such profits don't count toward meeting the San Diego savings bank's new capitalization requirements under 1989 federal law.
The new real estate unit would have a separate capital structure to comply with the law. 

The proposed holding company would also consolidate Great American Bank in San Diego and its Tucson, Ariz., savings bank into a single, federally chartered institution in San Diego.
The consolidation is expected to save $1 million a year in administrative costs, a Great American spokesman said.
