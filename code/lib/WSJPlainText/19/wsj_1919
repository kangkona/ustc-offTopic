United Merchants & Manufacturers Inc. said its president, Uzi Ruskin, withdrew his proposal to acquire control of the New York textile and clothing company. 

Last month, Mr. Ruskin proposed, among other things, to buy 3.5 million shares, or 38%, for $4 apiece.
Coupled with his current 1.2 million shares and 4% held by an associate, the stake would have given him control of 55% of the concern. 

In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Ruskin had said that holders of the other 45% of United Merchants would receive one-half share of a new preferred stock for each of their shares. 

A special committee of United Merchants directors said that in view of uncertainties regarding various legal and financial considerations, it couldn't recommend the plan to the full board. 

The company is exploring, with a major financial institution, the development of a plan to boost the value of the company for its holders, Mr. Ruskin said. 

In a separate SEC filing, Albert Safer, who holds 6.46% of United Merchants, said he retained investment bank Lazard Freres & Co. for advice as he evaluates the possibility of making a bid for the textile maker.
On Friday, Mr. Safer, a Newark, N.J., textile businessman, signed a confidentiality agreement under which United Merchants would provide him with nonpublic information.
