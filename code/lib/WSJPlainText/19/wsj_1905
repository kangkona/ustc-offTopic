Morrison said the engineering and construction segment performed well, with the mining and MK-Ferguson operations making important contributions. 

Boise, Idaho-based Morrison had losses totaling $186 million over the two years ended in December, but it has surged back to profitability as a result of cost-cutting and shedding of unprofitable operations.
