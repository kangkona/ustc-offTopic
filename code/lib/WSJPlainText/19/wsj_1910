Franklin Federal Savings & Loan Association said it expects to post a third-quarter net loss of about $8 million, or $1.04 a share, as a result of adding $11 million in loan-loss reserves. 

The Portland, Ore., thrift, which has $5.2 billion of assets, had net income in last year's third quarter of $1.8 million, or 23 cents a share.
Franklin said it expects to report earnings for the latest quarter next week. 

The additional reserves relate to possible write-downs of certain assets held by Franklin and its subsidiaries and the default of a bond in its investment portfolio, the thrift said.
According to a spokeswoman, they also relate to changes Franklin will have to make in its accounting procedures to comply with new federal capitalization requirements for thrifts. 

The company's shares closed yesterday at $4.25, off 25 cents, in national over-the-counter trading.
