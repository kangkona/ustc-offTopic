Loral Corp. said it received a $325 million order from Turkey's Ministry of Defense, the largest contract the company ever has received. 

Loral will provide to Turkey an electronic countermeasures system for its fleet of F-16 aircraft.
The system provides radar-threat warning and electronic jamming capabilities. 

The defense electronics maker said delivery will begin in October 1991 and run through mid-1995.
Loral said the contract with Turkey will provide opportunities for Loral to supply that country with other defense systems.
