Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and Chiron Corp. said they extended their offer for Connaught BioSciences Inc., valued at 866 million Canadian dollars (US$736 million) to Oct. 27. 

The companies earlier said they didn't want to raise their offer to match a rival bid by Institut Merieux S.A. of C$37 a share, or C$942 million.
But they said the C$30-a-share bid, which was due to expire Monday, may still be extended or varied. 

Merieux, a vaccine manufacturer based in Lyon, France, is 51%-held by French state-owned Rhone-Poulenc S.A. Ciba-Geigy is a major pharmaceutical concern based in Basel, Switzerland.
Chiron, another pharmaceutical concern, is based in Emeryville, Calif.
Connaught is a biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing concern. 

Institut Merieux's bid for Toronto-based Connaught has run into problems with the Canadian government, which told Merieux last week that it wasn't convinced that the proposed acquisition would be of "net benefit" to Canada.
Merieux officials are expected to meet with federal officials in Ottawa today to discuss the decision.
