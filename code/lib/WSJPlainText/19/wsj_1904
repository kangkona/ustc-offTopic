Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission Wednesday cleared Rhone-Poulenc S.A.'s purchase of a specialty bulk-chemical unit from Monsanto Co., saying the purchase was unlikely to have any lasting impact on U.K. industrial consumers. 

The commission, which was asked to study the deal by the Department of Trade and Industry after its announcement in February, said the diversity of global supply of chemicals used in making analgesic drugs was great enough to offset the dominant U.K. market share Rhone-Poulenc would gain through the acquisition. 

The French chemical giant would hold an 80% share of the U.K. market for salicylic acid, methyl salicylate and bulk aspirin. 

The commission found that if the British government attempted to block the merger, Rhone-Poulenc would likely respond by closing the salicylates plant Monsanto operates in Wales, removing the matter from U.K. jurisdiction.
