The Arizona Corporations Commission authorized an 11.5% rate increase at Tucson Electric Power Co., substantially lower than recommended last month by a commission hearing officer and barely half the rise sought by the utility. 

The ruling follows a host of problems at Tucson Electric, including major write-downs, a 60% slash in the common stock dividend and the departure of former Chairman Einar Greve during a company investigation of his stock sales. 

The Arizona regulatory ruling calls for $42 million in added revenue yearly, compared with a $57 million boost proposed by the commission hearing officer.
The company had sought increases totaling $80.3 million, or 22%. 

The decision was announced after trading ended.
Tucson Electric closed at $20.875 a share, down 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

A Tucson Electric spokesman said the utility was disappointed by the commission's decision and "concerned about the financial integrity of the company."
