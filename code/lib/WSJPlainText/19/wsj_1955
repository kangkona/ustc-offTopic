Northern Trust Corp. said its board adopted a shareholder rights plan aimed at deterring unwanted takeover bids, but said it's not aware of any plan to acquire the banking concern. 

Under Northern Trust's plan, shareholders were issued rights that, in the event of certain attempted takeovers, allow holders to buy shares in the company at half price.
