Japanese machinery makers received orders totaling 1.465 trillion yen ($10.33 billion) in August, up 14% from a year earlier, the Economic Planning Agency said. 

"Equipment orders on the domestic side were particularly strong in shipping and power utilities," said an agency official. 

The latest report compares with a modest 9.9% increase in July machinery orders from a year earlier.
