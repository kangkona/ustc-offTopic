Democrat Gene Taylor won a special election to fill the congressional seat vacated by the death of Republican Larkin Smith, taking back the GOP's lone redoubt in Mississippi's House delegation. 

Mr. Taylor's overwhelming victory against Republican Tom Anderson reclaims a seat the Republicans had held for 17 years and gives the Democrats their fifth victory in the seven special House elections held this year.
Mr. Taylor, a 36-year-old state senator from Bay St. Louis, won 65% of the vote in a district that has voted Republican in the past five presidential elections and that was once represented by Republican U.S. Sen. Trent Lott. 

Mr. Taylor's victory was an embarrassment for both state and national Republicans.
Mr. Anderson, a former Lott aide, received campaign assistance from the senator and from President Bush, who visited the district last week. 

Even so, Mr. Taylor carried all but one of the district's dozen counties.
Rep. Smith died in a plane crash on Aug. 13.
