Par Pharmaceutical Inc. said it named its interim president and chief executive officer, Kenneth I. Sawyer, to those posts permanently, and elected him to the board. 

Par also said it was advised by the U.S. attorney for Maryland that it is one of a number of companies being investigated by a federal grand jury for alleged violations of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
Par, a generic-drug maker that has been plagued by management problems, was already the subject of a federal criminal inquiry into the drug-approval process and a Food and Drug Administration investigation. 

A Par spokesman said he understood the criminal investigation in Maryland relates to matters Par disclosed in July, when Par said it filed false drug information with the FDA.
At the time, the company said it was recalling one of its drugs and had stopped selling two others.
The spokesman said he also understood that the inquiry related to the existence of an "off-the-record" production book.
The book noted changes made at the manufacturing level that weren't disclosed to the FDA. 

Par said it is cooperating in the investigation. 

Also yesterday, Ashok Patel, a former Par official who pleaded guilty to providing an FDA employee an illegal gratuity of $3,000, was sentenced by a federal judge in Baltimore to one year of community service and a $150,000 fine.
Mr. Patel also was placed on three years' probation.
Mr. Patel resigned as senior vice president of Par in April.
In July, Par and a 60%-owned unit agreed to plead guilty in that inquiry, as did another former Par official. 

Mr. Sawyer began running the company on an interim basis in late September.
Par said it selected him for the posts of president and chief executive on a permanent basis because of his experience in the industry and his performance at Par.
Perry Levine, chairman, said Mr. Sawyer had "taken significant steps" to restore the company's credibility and sense of professionalism and integrity.
