Fleet/Norstar Financial Group reported a 12% increase in net income in the third quarter, led by a 43% gain in its financial services group.
Fleet's net was $96.4 million, or 86 cents a primary share, compared with $85.8 million, or 79 cents a share, a year earlier. 

The Providence, R.I., financial services group, which includes commercial-credit, leasing and mortgage-banking operations, contributed $30.6 million to net, up from last year's $21.3 million.
Fleet also noted that, unlike other banking companies in the Northeast, it has been only marginally hurt by nonperforming loans that have resulted from the slumping regional real estate market. 

Fleet reported nine-month net of $279.0 million, or $2.51 a primary share, up from $248.2 million, or $2.28 a share, a year earlier.
