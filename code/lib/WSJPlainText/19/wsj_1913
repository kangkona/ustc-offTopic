New York Times Co. said net income rose in the third quarter because of a one-time gain on the sale of the company's cable-TV system. 

Net surged to $210.8 million, or $2.68 a share, from $26.7 million, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier.
The latest quarter included a gain of $193.3 million, or $2.46 a share, from the sale of New York Times Cable, completed in August. 

Exclusive of the gain, operating profit declined 35% to $16.4 million, or 21 cents a share, from $25.2 million, or 31 cents a share.
The decline primarily reflected the dilution from acquiring McCall's, Golf World (U.S.) and Sailing World magazines; lower equity earnings from the forest-products group because of price discounting and an unfavorable exchange rate, and an 8.7% decline in advertising linage at the New York Times, the company's flagship newspaper.
Advertising volume at the company's 35 regional newspapers decreased 1.1%.
The company said the negative factors are expected to continue into next year. 

Revenue rose 6.4% to $415.3 million from $390.5 million.
