Mesa Airlines said the takeover offer it received earlier this week from StatesWest Airlines is for a combination of cash and securities valued by StatesWest at $10 a Mesa share.
Both companies are regional carriers in the Southwest. 

When it made the offer, StatesWest declined to disclose details and asked Mesa to do the same.
But Farmington, N.M.-based Mesa said the offer was for $7 in cash and unspecified StatesWest securities valued at $3 a share.
Based on the number of Mesa shares outstanding not already owned by StatesWest, the proposed takeover would have a value of about $15.3 million.
StatesWest owns 7.25% of Mesa. 

Last week, Mesa rejected a general proposal from StatesWest that the two carriers combine.
In response to the specific offer, Gary Risley, Mesa vice president, said management will ask directors to employ a financial consultant to advise them.
