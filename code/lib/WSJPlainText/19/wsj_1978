The public sector borrowing requirement, the most widely used measure of Britain's government deficit or surplus, showed a deficit of #200 million in September, compared with a deficit of #765 million in August and a deficit of #1.08 billion in September 1988, the Treasury said. 

In the six months since the current fiscal year began April 1, the surplus totaled #500 million, compared with a surplus of #3.6 billion in the year-earlier period. 

The government is projecting a #14 billion surplus for the fiscal year. 

The reported figures for the public sector borrowing requirement include receipts from the sale of state-owned industries.
Excluding those receipts, the government deficit would have totaled about #2.5 billion in the first six months, compared with #1.3 billion a year earlier, the Treasury said.
