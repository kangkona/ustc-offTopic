Coca-Cola Co. may be about to intensify the cola wars. 

Coke said it will test market a caffeine-free version of its flagship brand, Coca-Cola Classic, beginning next week in Charlotte, N.C. Other, as yet unnamed, cities will follow.
If all goes well, the product will be rolled out for national sales sometime next year, a Coke spokesman said. 

After the confusion surrounding the change of the Coke formula in 1985, Coca-Cola was reluctant to clutter the Classic name with a brand extension.
But now, the soft-drink giant appears willing to take the risk. 

"The name Classic Coke has tremendous value, and they haven't merchandised that name before," says Jesse Meyers, publisher of the trade journal Beverage Digest. 

The Coke spokesman said a caffeine-free Classic should help increase volume of the original brand.
Indeed, analysts have said that the absence of new products, among other factors, has limited sales growth throughout the industry.
Coke now leads Pepsi in market share in caffeine-free diet colas but trails Pepsi in sales of caffeine-free sugared colas, according to Beverage Digest. 

Coke introduced a caffeine-free sugared cola based on its original formula in 1983.
It switched to a caffeine-free formula using its new Coke in 1985. 

Coke has been studying the possibility of introducing a caffeine-free Classic for a year, a company spokesman said.
He said large increases in sales of other non-caffeine soft drinks make the timing right now.
