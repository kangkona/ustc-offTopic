GTE Corp. and MCI Communications Corp. reported strong earnings gains to record levels for the third quarter.
Southwestern Bell Corp. and Cincinnati Bell posted slight declines. 

GTE Corp. 

GTE said net income rose 18%, aided by higher long-distance calling volumes and an increase in telephone lines in service.
Pretax operating profit from telephone operations rose 8.2% but profits from telecommunications products and electrical products were flat. 

Revenues rose 8.8% to $4.35 billion from $4.0 billion. 

The company said the quarter included a 10% increase in local-exchange usage for long-distance calling and a 5% increase in the number of access lines in service.
Earlier rate reductions in Texas and California reduced the quarter's revenue and operating profit $55 million; a year earlier, operating profit in telephone operations was reduced by a similar amount as a result of a provision for a reorganization. 

Revenue in the telecommunications products and services unit rose 27% to $728.8 million, but operating profit was unchanged at $26.3 million, partly because of start-up expenses.
Electrical products' sales fell to $496.7 million from $504.5 million with higher world-wide lighting volume offset by lower domestic prices and the impact of weaker currencies in Europe and South America.
Operating profit of $37.2 million was unchanged. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, GTE rose $1.25 to $64.125.
MCI Communications Corp. 

MCI, which stepped up efforts to sell long-distance telephone service to residential customers, reported a 59% jump in earnings.
Revenue rose 23% to $1.67 billion from $1.36 billion. 

Operating profit grew 57% to $269 million from $171 million, while operating margins rose to 16.1% from 15.9% the previous quarter and 12.6% a year ago.
Daniel Akerson, MCI chief financial officer, said the company sees further improvements in operating margins. "We think we can take it to the 18% range over next 18 to 24 months," he said. 

In national over-the-counter trading, MCI fell $2.625 to $42.375.
Charles Schellke, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., said some investors apparently expected slightly better revenue growth. 

The company said that residential traffic grew faster than business traffic and attributed that to its new PrimeTime calling plan that competes with American Telephone & Telegraph's Reach Out America plan.
MCI claims about 12% of the overall long-distance telephone market but just under 10% of the $23 billion residential market.
It has been trying to improve its share of the residential market.
The company wants its business mix to more closely match that of AT&T -- a step it says will help prevent cross subsidization. 

Mr. Akerson said MCI recorded "another solid cash positive quarter," its fourth in a row, but declined to comment on whether the company is considering a dividend or is planning any acquisition.
The current quarter, he said, "looks fine.
We think revenue will continue to grow and that we can control costs and thus improve profitability." 

Southwestern Bell Corp. 

Southwestern Bell Corp. said net dropped 8.7%, mainly the result of four extraordinary items: a franchise tax refund that its Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. unit received last year; a production shift of several Yellow Pages directories to the fourth quarter from the third; a rate refund in Missouri and a one-time adjustment to phone company revenues. 

Revenue slipped 1.2% to $2.21 billion from $2.23 billion. 

The earnings drop had been expected.
Chairman Zane E. Barnes said Southwestern Bell's "businesses are healthy and are continuing to grow." 

The company reported a 3.1% increase in the number of access lines in service, and also said its Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems unit added 30,000 new customers, with a current total of about 333,000. 

Southwestern shares fell 50 cents to $55.875 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

Cincinnati Bell Inc. 

Cincinnati Bell Inc. said net declined 1.8%.
The company noted that the year-ago period was particularly strong, with an increase of nearly 70%.
Revenue jumped nearly 17% to $223.3 million from $191.4 million.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Cincinnati Bell fell 25 cents to $29. 

The company said that the number of access lines dropped slightly in the quarter, a decline attributed to seasonal fluctuations.
For the year, however, access lines in service have increased 5.5%. 

Chairman D.H. Hibbard said the company has set a new five year goal of doubling revenues to about $1.8 billion while steadily increasing net.
