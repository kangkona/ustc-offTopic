Beazer PLC, a major British building materials and construction concern, reported a 24% jump in pretax profit for its latest financial year, helped largely by contributions from its U.S. unit, Koppers Co. 

Pretax profit for the year to June 30 rose to #142.5 million ($224.5 million) from #114.7 million ($180.7 million), broadly matching analysts' expectations. 

Profit after taxes and minority interests but before extraordinary items increased 22% to #92.6 million from #75.6 million a year earlier, while fully diluted earnings per share rose to 29.90 pence (47 cents) from 24.68 pence (39 cents).
