After enduring three days of heavy selling, the beleaguered Nasdaq over-the-counter market finally rebounded, rising sharply in hearty trading. 

The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 0.7%, or 3.35, to 463.28.
It rose more than the New York Stock Exchange Composite, which improved 0.2%.
Among bigger stocks, the Nasdaq 100 Index rose 1%, or 4.56, to 453.05, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2%. 

Richard Bruno, head of OTC trading at PaineWebber, said the OTC market has a habit of lagging big moves on the New York Stock Exchange.
While the industrial average rallied on Monday following last Friday's collapse, the OTC market, which didn't suffer too badly during the correction, tumbled. 

"Our market got hit a lot harder on Monday than the listed market," Mr. Bruno said. "We're just recovering and getting back to business as usual.
I'm encouraged by the action." 

The trading pace was busy, with 4,343 issues and 147.6 million shares changing hands.
Advancing issues beat declining ones, 1,271 to 811. 

Much of the jockeying by OTC traders and investors centered on shares of companies that might be financially affected by damage from the devastating earthquake in northern California.
As investors speculated about the long- and short-term implications, shares of a number of companies that might either profit or face problems because of the disaster were actively traded.
Heading the list: insurance, construction and technology companies located in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

Insurance-related stocks were mixed as investors tried to figure out how to assess the impact of the property damage and deaths on those concerns.
Traders said property-casualty companies with the heaviest exposure in the San Francisco area include the OTC's Safeco and Ohio Casualty. 

Frank Gilmartin, a trader who follows insurance stocks for Fox-Pitt Kelton, said his strategy was to sell early. 

Then, if the stocks fell sharply, he planned to begin buying them aggressively, on the theory that the companies that insure against property damage and accidents will have to raise rates eventually to compensate for the claims they will pay to earthquake victims and victims of last month's Hurricane Hugo.
As well, reinsurers and insurance brokerage companies will have improved profits. 

Many investors expected damage from the hurricane to be the catalyst for higher rates in the industry, which has been depressed because of low rates arising from intense competition.
But Mr. Gilmartin said the hurricane damage wasn't extensive enough to prompt premium boosts. "The companies just gave back what they had reserved for," he said. "Now, they'll have to increase their coffers to protect for the future and that means rate increases." 

Overall OTC insurance issues were mixed.
Safeco fell 1/8 to 32 5/8 on 462,900 shares.
Ohio Casualty rose 1/4 to 51 3/4 on 137,200 shares.
St. Paul Cos. jumped 2 to 59 3/4 on 517,500 shares.
Academy Insurance fell 1/32 to 1 3/16; but volume totaled 1.2 million shares.
The Nasdaq Insurance Index jumped 4.15 to 529.32 on the day, while the barometer of big insurance and banking issues climbed 1.72 to 455.29. 

Investors expect SunGard Data Systems, a company that provides disaster recovery services for computer-dependent businesses, to profit from the earthquake.
SunGard's stock rose 1 3/4 to 21 1/4 on 194,000 shares. 

Shares of Kasler, a California road and bridge builder, were heavily traded, jumping 2 1/8 to 9 7/8 on 1.3 million shares. 

Guy F. Atkinson added 7/8 to 16 7/8, on 335,700 shares.
The company, based in San Francisco, provides industrial infrastructure engineering and construction services. 

Traders were initially nervous about shares of companies, including many leading OTC computer companies, such as Apple Computer with offices in the vicinity of the area damaged by the quake.
But most of those stocks fared well.
Apple Computer gained 1 to 48 1/4; Ashton-Tate rose 3/8 to 10 3/8.
Intel also added 3/8 to 33 7/8.
But Sun Microsystems slipped 1/4 to 17 1/4.
Shares of biotechnology companies in the area were also higher.
Chiron was up 1/2 to 27 and Cetus gained 1/2 to 16 3/8. 

The stocks of computer-related companies located outside California improved, too.
Microsoft advanced 1 7/8 to 80 1/2 and Lotus Development added 1 1/4 to 32 1/2. 

In other earthquake-related news, Hambrecht & Quist's OTC market makers were excused from trading yesterday and its positions were frozen for the day by the National Association of Securities Dealers.
Power couldn't be restored at the company's San Francisco headquarters to allow trading yesterday morning.
In New York, Roger Killion, a Hambrecht executive vice president, said he expects OTC trading at the company to resume this morning, either in New York or in San Francisco. 

In other trading, Medco Containment Services gained 7/8 to 15 on 1.9 million shares after reporting a loss for the first quarter, which ended Sept. 30.
The company earned $6.6 million in the year-earlier quarter. 

Jaguar's American depositary receipts added 3/8 to 10 3/4 on volume of 1.1 million.
Analysts in London believe investors, despite their stampede to dump takeover stocks, should hold on tight to their Jaguar shares, this newspaper's Heard on the Street column said yesterday. 

Amgen rose 1 1/2 to 50 3/4 in heavy trading.
Analysts figure Amgen could benefit as a result of troubles facing its competitor, Genetics Institute, over the anti-anemia drug EPO. Genetics Institute disclosed recently that it is embroiled in a dispute with Boehringer Mannheim, which distributes the drug, regarding the usability of some batches.
