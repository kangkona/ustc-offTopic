The House Ethics Committee officially cited Rep. Jim Bates (D., Calif.) for sexually harassing two female employees, but didn't recommend formal disciplinary action. 

Rep. Bates said he accepted the finding, but one of the victims, Dorena Bertussi, denounced the ethics panel's action as "absurd." 

Acting more than a year after Ms. Bertussi filed a complaint, the panel issued a "letter of reproval" saying Rep. Bates had admitted conduct that violated a House rule forbidding discrimination against employees on account of their sex.
It ordered Rep. Bates to write letters of apology to Ms. Bertussi and to a second complainant, Karen Dryden. 

Rep. Bates said he would write the letters as ordered. "I accept the resolution of the matter by the Ethics Committee," he said. 

The panel also warned Rep. Bates that any further violations "may result in a recommendation that disciplinary action be considered." But Ms. Bertussi asked, "Who in their right mind is going to file another complaint with the Ethics Committee?" 

Rep. Bates has publicly begged for forgiveness from voters and was re-elected with 60% of the vote last November.
