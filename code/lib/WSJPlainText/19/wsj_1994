U.S. steel imports in August fell 14% from a year earlier to 1,531,000 tons, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. 

The trade group's compilation of Commerce Department data showed that August imports, the second largest monthly total of the year, were up 5% from July's 1,458,000 tons but below last year's high of 1,979,000 tons in June 1988. 

August imports claimed 18.5% of the U.S. market, compared with 19.3% in July and 20.5% in August 1988.
The latest month's figures show that imports of steel from European Community nations fell to 466,000 tons from 481,000 a month earlier, while imports from Japan rose to 323,000 tons from 288,000 in July.
Imports from Canada rose to 272,000 tons in August from 209,000 in July. 

The American Institute for Imported Steel said imports for the first eight months of 1989 were below the level allowed by the Voluntary Restraint Agreement program.
The institute said that, excluding semifinished steel products, year-to-date imports represented 15.2% of consumption, compared with a permitted maximum of 18.5%.
