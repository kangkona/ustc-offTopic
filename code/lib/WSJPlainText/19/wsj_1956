National Patent Development Corp. said it plans to purchase as many as 200,000 common shares of its 81%-controlled Interferon Sciences Inc. unit in periodic, open-market purchases. 

The 200,000 shares are about 23% of Interferon's common shares outstanding, excluding National Patent's stake. 

Noting the recent Food and Drug Administration approval of Interferon's genital warts treatment, National Patent said it believes Interferon's stock is undervalued.
