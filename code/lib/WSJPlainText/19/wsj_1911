Arkla Inc. said that as part of a program to improve profitability it will take a total of $189 million in after-tax charges by year end.
It also announced an initial public offering of 18% of its gas exploration and production subsidiary. 

The Shreveport, La., natural gas company said the charges, though partially offset by a one-time gain from the offering, will result in a full-year after-tax loss.
Last year, the company had net income of $117.3 million, or $1.30 a share. 

Arkla said it will report $179 milllion in one-time charges against continuing operations for the third quarter, reflecting settlement of certain natural gas contracts.
It said it will take a $10 million fourth-quarter charge against discontinued operations, reflecting certain write-downs and the planned sale of a unit. 

Arkla said its initial offering of 18% of Arkla Exploration Co. is expected to result in a net gain of about $90 million, which will be used to pay down Arkla debt.
Arkla Exploration owns sizable gas and crude-oil reserves in the South and Southwest.
