Lionel Corp. 's board unanimously rejected a tender offer of $8 a share, or $95.4 million, for as much as 90% of Lionel by a group with a 9.9% stake in the toy retailer. 

Lionel also urged holders of its stock and debt not to tender their securities, saying it wants to remain independent to pursue its business strategy.
Lionel also said the offer by Robert I. Toussie Limited Partnership is inadequate, and full of conditions that leave it "subject to substantial uncertainty." 

In addition, Lionel began a lawsuit in federal District Court in New York seeking to enjoin the offer, alleging, among other things, violations of federal securities law and fraudulent manipulation of the market for Lionel's securities. 

Robert I. Toussie, general partner of the investment group, said the Lionel response reflected management's entrenched position, saying officials had failed to come up with a better alternative to his group's offer.
Mr. Toussie said he would respond to Lionel's suit after his lawyers review it.
