South Korean President Roh Tae Woo, brushing aside suggestions that the won be revalued again, said the currency's current level against the dollar is "appropriate." 

His comments, made in response to reporters' questions at the National Press Club here, signaled that Seoul is resisting U.S. pressure for a further rise in the currency's value.
The U.S. wants a higher won to make South Korea's exports more expensive and help trim Seoul's trade surplus.
Many South Korean business people want a devaluation instead, arguing that the won's recent gains already have weakened the country's export performance. 

Mr. Roh also said South Korea is taking steps that would free the won to respond to market forces.
Seoul has pointed to its lack of a foreign exchange market as one reason the won's value remains heavily controlled. 

Mr. Roh said a U.S. demand for the removal of South Korean import quotas on beef will be resolved "satisfactorily" but gave no hint when that will happen.
Speaking to a joint meeting of Congress earlier, he said South Korea can't move quickly on such agricultural trade issues "without causing political and social trauma."
