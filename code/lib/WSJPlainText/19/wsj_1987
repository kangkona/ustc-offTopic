Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons said he raised his stake in Lockheed Corp. to 10.62% from 10.43% of the aerospace and electronics concern's common shares. 

In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Simmons said he and companies he controls, NL Industries Inc. and NL Chemicals Inc., hold 6,744,600 shares of Lockheed, of Calabasas, Calif.
They include 122,700 shares bought Friday for between $47.125 and $48 each. 

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Lockheed closed at $46.125 a share, down 12.5 cents. 

Earlier this week, Mr. Simmons objected to published reports quoting him as saying he planned to sell his Lockheed stake because "the defense industry seems to be getting more uncertain." 

Valhi Inc., another of Mr. Simmons' companies, responded to an article Monday in The Wall Street Journal, which credited a story in the Sunday Los Angeles Daily News.
Valhi said the articles didn't accurately reflect Valhi and its affiliates' intentions toward Lockheed.
Instead, Valhi said, they may increase, decrease or retain their Lockheed holdings, depending on a number of conditions.
