Gamma Biologicals Inc. said it adopted a rights plan under which stockholders will be given one right for each share of common held as of Oct. 2, 1989. 

Shares issued after that will include one right. 

The rights are exercisable after, among other things, an investor acquires a holding of 20% or more of Gamma Biologicals common.
Each right entitles the holder to buy one share of common stock for $15. 

Gamma Biologicals, which manufactures and markets specialized diagnostic testing products, said the plan isn't in response to any known takeover attempts. 

In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Gamma shares slipped 12.5 cents to $2.625.
