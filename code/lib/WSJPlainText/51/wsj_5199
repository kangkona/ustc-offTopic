Democrats in Congress may be desperate to make George Bush break his no-new-taxes pledge, but beyond the Beltway a lot of Democrats don't think that makes either political or economic sense.
The two Democrats who won special elections for the House in Texas and California last week both made clear their aversion to taxes.
And now in liberal Massachusetts, Lt. Governor Evelyn Murphy has broken with Michael Dukakis and is promising no increase in taxes for four years if she is elected governor.
She would even force state agencies to accept budget cuts of up to 5% in order to keep her pledge.
The difference between the "national" Democrats and state and local Democrats appears to be growing ever greater.
