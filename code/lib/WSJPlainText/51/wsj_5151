Interpoint Corp. said Peter Van Oppen, president and chief operating officer, has been named chief executive officer. 

Mr. Van Oppen, 35 years old, succeeds Phillip Linwick, who retains his post as chairman and plans to remain a close adviser to the company.
Mr. Linwick, 58, said the move had been planned long ago. "Peter has done exceedingly well and he's ready," Mr. Linwick said. 

Interpoint makes power converters and microcircuits.
Mr. Linwick said Mr. Van Oppen will retain his present title of president but will drop the chief operating officer post, which Interpoint has no plans to fill.
