GF Corp. said it is in technical default under the net worth covenant of its bank loans. 

The office furniture maker blamed the loan problems on slower recovery in sales.
GF said it is negotiating with current lenders and seeking other loans. 

GF officials weren't available for further comment. 

In the first six months, GF had a net loss of $3.7 million, compared with a net loss of $947,000 a year earlier.
