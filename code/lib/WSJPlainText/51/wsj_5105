The Senate Judiciary Committee set the stage for a debate over how to protect the U.S. flag, sending the Senate competing measures designed to circumvent a Supreme Court ruling that bars punishing a person who burns the flag as a political protest. 

On a 9-5 vote, the panel approved a proposed statute that would prohibit desecration of the flag.
The committee then voted 8-6 to send the Senate a constitutional amendment barring such desecration, with the recommendation that it not pass.
The full Senate is to consider the statute no later than Oct. 7 and vote on the constitutional amendment by the following week. 

Congressional Democrats, wary of tampering with the First Amendment, want to try a statutory remedy, while Republicans, led by President Bush, argue that only a constitutional amendment would protect the flag. 

Last week, the House voted 380-38 to approve a statute, and House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) has promised to schedule a vote on a constitutional amendment after the Senate acts on it. 

In June, the Supreme Court threw out the conviction of a Texas man who set a flag afire during a 1984 demonstration because he was "engaging in political expression" that is protected by the First Amendment.
