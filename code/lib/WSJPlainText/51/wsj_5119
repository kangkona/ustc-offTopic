Marion Laboratories Inc. said it named six Dow Chemical Co. executives to its board as part of a previously announced agreement to combine Marion and Dow's Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals subsidiary. 

The pharmaceutical concern said the addition of the six new members will bring its board membership to 15.
The directors will serve on an interim basis until its shareholders approve a slate to be presented at the annual meeting, to be held on Nov. 9. 

The new board members are Frank P. Popoff, president and chief executive of Dow; Keith R. McKennon, executive vice president; Enrique C. Falla, vice president and chief financial officer; Joseph G. Temple Jr., chairman and chief executive of Merrell Dow; David B. Sharrock, president and chief operating officer of Merrell Dow; and Walter M. Lovenberg, president of Merrell Dow Research Institute. 

Marion said the transaction to merge the two companies is expected to be completed in November.
