Short interest for the month ended Sept. 15 fell 1.3% on the New York Stock Exchange but crept up less than 1% to a record on the American Stock Exchange. 

On the Big Board, short interest slipped to 547,347,585 shares from 554,537,766 a month earlier.
On the Amex, short interest reached 51,887,168 shares from an adjusted 51,844,137. 

For the year-earlier month, the New York exchange reported 447,212,558 shares, indicating a year-to-year advance of 22%.
A year ago, the Amex posted 34,381,743 shares, indicating a full 50% rise. 

A trader who sells short borrows stock and sells it, betting that the stock's price will decline and that he can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender. 

Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet been purchased for return to lenders.
Although a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's price will decline, some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be bought back. 

Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitraging.
The figures occasionally include incomplete transactions in restricted stock. 

The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board short interest ratio rose to 3.38 from last month's 3.13.
The ratio is the number of trading days, at the exchange's average trading volume, that would be required to convert the total short interest position. 

Some analysts suggest, however, that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because options and other products can be used to hedge short positions. 

The largest Big Board short position was posted by Bristol-Myers Co., which more than doubled to 19.6 million shares from 9.4 million as of Aug. 15.
Bristol is acquiring Squibb Corp. for stock, and short-sellers have been reported to be targeting pharmaceutical companies.
International Business Machines Corp., a bellwether issue, dropped to 2.4 million shares from 2.7 million. 

Leading the Amex shorts again was Texas Air Corp., although the short position in the airline company again dropped, this time to 3.4 million shares from 3.7 million. 

The largest Big Board drop in short interest volume was that of Panhandle Eastern Corp., a pipeline company, to 495,904 shares from 6.4 million.
The company has sold all major non-pipeline assets -- sooner than expected -- from its acquisition of Texas Eastern Corp. Analysts also note that gas companies' stocks have been rising on speculation that natural gas prices will climb strongly, with shortages possible during the peak winter season. 

Another closely watched issue, Exxon Corp., was second on the volume-decliner list, falling to 5.1 million shares from 8.5 million. 

Hasbro Inc. showed the biggest volume drop on the Amex, to 50,246 shares from 1.5 million.
Analysts are closely watching for -- and some are touting -- the toy company's Record Breakers model racing cars, which Hasbro is expected to unveil in the next few weeks. 

Bristol-Myers also posted the largest Big Board volume increase, while Fruit of the Loom Inc. led on the Amex, rising to nearly two million shares from 1.2 million. 

The adjacent tables show the Big Board and Amex issues in which a short interest position of at least 100,000 shares existed as of mid-September or in which there was a short position change of at least 50,000 shares since mid-August (see accompanying tables -- WSJ Sept. 22, 1989).
