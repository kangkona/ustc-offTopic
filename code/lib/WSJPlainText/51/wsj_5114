Excel Industries Inc. said slowing production by automotive-industry customers will depress its third- and fourth-quarter earnings below year-ago levels. 

The maker of windows for cars, trucks, and other vehicles said it plans to report third-quarter net income fell below the year-earlier $686,000, or 12 cents a share, although sales will be about even with last year's $60 million. 

In addition, the company said it expects to report a decline in both sales and earnings for the fourth quarter. 

Excel said its "best estimate" is that it will have 1989 sales about 7% above last year's $259.9 million -- an indicated $278.1 million.
But it said earnings for the current year could fall to as low as $1.05 a share from $1.10 a share a year ago. 

For the six months, Excel net has totaled $5.7 million, or 88 cents a share, on revenue of $153.3 million. 

"We fully expected comparisons to fade during the second half," said James J. Lohman, chief executive officer.
The company said the downward revision of its full-year forecast came after it completed its latest assessment of fourth-quarter customer intentions. 

Excel said, however, that it doesn't think the automotive industry is facing a long-term downturn.
