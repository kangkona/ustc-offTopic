Horizon Financial Services Inc. said it offered to extend to Oct. 2 its proposal to acquire Northern Savings & Loan Co. for $65 a share, or about $14.2 million. 

Horizon's offer was set to expire Sept. 25, but Northern officials indicated yesterday that the thrift's board wouldn't meet to consider the offer until October.
Northern is a thrift based in Elyria, Ohio.
