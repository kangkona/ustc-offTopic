Northrop Corp., in part of an management overhaul planned earlier this year, said Fred J. Manzella was elected to its board and to a newly created post of executive vice president. 

As a director, Mr. Manzella, 59 years old, succeeds Frank W. Lynch who retired as an officer of the aerospace concern last year and as a director yesterday. 

Mr. Manzella, previously senior vice president for business operations, which included reponsibility for contracts, pricing, environmental management, security, material and services, will add responsibility for Northrop's legal, human resources and public affairs operations. 

Ken Kresa, president and chief operating officer and successor-designate as chief executive officer to Chairman Thomas V. Jones, said Mr. Manzella's post is intended to promote greater efficiency by bringing corporate staff functions closer to important business operations. 

Mr. Kresa said Mr. Manzella's election is part of a management realignment plan announced in May at the company's annual meeting.
At that time, Northrop said it might cut as many as 3,000 employees from its 44,000-member work force. 

Analysts speculated that much of the realignment plans were simply putting the best possible face on an industry cycle that has seen development peak in a variety of Northrop products.
