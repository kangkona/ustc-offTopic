Alan Gotlieb, former Canadian ambassador to the U.S., writing in the July 31, 1989, edition of the Globe & Mail newspaper, in Toronto: 

It is an astounding paradox that the American people return a congressional slate almost totally unchanged from election to election, while clamoring for "renewal" and a break with the past when choosing a president.
Almost all presidential candidates -- Nixon, Carter, Reagan, even John Kennedy -- run against "Washington" or the "system," codewords for an establishment thought to be out of touch with the real America.
Each new campaign is proclaimed a crusade to liberate the land from the foolish policies of the predecessor president.
It is as if the U.S. is in perpetual revolution. 

Richard J. Bloomfield, former ambassador to Portugal and Ecuador, speaking to the World Peace Foundation in May: 

A little hypocrisy is not always a bad thing in diplomacy; but a hypocrite is not a cynic.
A cynic knows that what he says publicly about his motives is false; a hypocrite, in contrast, is not conscious of the discrepancy between what he says and what he wants.
By and large, Americans are not cynical, so when we are hypocritical about our foreign-policy objectives, we tend to delude ourselves.
