A federal court jury in St. Louis said a Mobil Corp. unit should pay Monsanto Co. $21.1 million for breach of contract. 

Monsanto, a drug and chemical concern, had claimed Mobil Oil Corp. violated a five-year agreement to buy phosphorous products; Mobil had contended that the purchase agreements had been negated when Mobil sold certain plants in 1985. 

A Mobil spokesman said the company disagrees with the verdict, but won't make a decision on whether to appeal until the trial judge issues a formal order.
Such orders can differ from the jury's finding.
Mobil said it couldn't immediately determine whether a reserve had been established to cover the award payout. 

Monsanto said it hasn't yet booked the award as revenue, and a spokesman, referring to the possibility of an appeal or other legal delay, said that "we won't until we receive the check."
