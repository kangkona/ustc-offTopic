Yankee Cos., Boston, said it postponed a special stockholder meeting, previously scheduled for Sept. 22, to Sept. 29 because of delays in mailing proxy material. 

Shareholders will vote on a proposal to exchange one share of preferred stock for 1.2 shares of common stock and one warrant to purchase another common share for $3.50 until June 30, 1993. 

If the proposal is approved, the company will change its name to National Environmental Group Inc. 

Yankee said as of yesterday, 50% of the preferred stockholders and 40% of the common stockholders have returned their proxies.
The transaction must be approved by two-thirds of the holders of each class of stock. 

The energy concern said over 80% of the total preferred stock proxies received have voted in favor of the proposal.
