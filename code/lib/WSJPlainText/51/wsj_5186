American General Corp. signed a definitive agreement to sell its group life and health insurance companies for $195 million to Associated Insurance Companies Inc. of Indianapolis. 

The Houston financial services concern said that the sale of the group insurance operations will result in a third-quarter loss from discontinued operations of about $9 million, or 7 cents a share.
When combined with a gain on the May sale of American General's property-liability insurance business, the company expects year-to-date net income from discontinued operations of $77 million, or 58 cents a share. 

Both sales are part of a divestiture program that the company said it undertook because of its decision to market its services primarily through company-managed distribution systems.
The divested businesses market their products through independent agents and brokers.
