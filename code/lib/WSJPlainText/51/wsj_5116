Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. posted a 58% increase in third-quarter net income to $19.5 million, or 57 cents a share, from $12.4 million, or 45 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. 

Latest-quarter earnings included a one-time charge of $3.4 million from a recent issue of $405 million face-amount of bonds, which generated proceeds of $125 million. 

Revenue of the home-builder rose 22% to $276.7 million from $226.6 million a year ago.
Housing revenue accounted for $223.8 million of the latest-quarter revenue, compared with $209.3 million a year ago.
However, fewer homes sales were closed in this year's quarter, down to 1,318 from 1,376.
The decrease was offset by an increase in the average sales price for a home to $169,500 from $151,400 a year ago. 

Bruce Karatz, president and chief executive officer, attributed the strong performance to a new strategy of increased home building at more sites in California and France, improvement in the company's operating margins and continued growth of the California market. 

Net home orders in California rose 71% in the period to 1,191 from 697.
Total residential backlog at Aug. 31 was 2,566 units valued at $396 million, compared with 1,971 units valued at $306 million a year ago.
