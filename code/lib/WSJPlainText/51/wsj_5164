Coats Viyella PLC, a British textile manufacturer, said pretax profit slumped 27% during the latest six months, as high U.K. interest rates and rising imports ripped into profitability. 

In addition, the textile group said trading conditions continued to deteriorate, as consumer demand for its products was depressed. 

In the first half, profit before taxes dropped to #55.2 million ($87.4 million) from #76 million in the year-earlier period, but slightly better than market expectations of about #52 million. 

During the period, the company's friendly merger with Tootal Group PLC was referred to the U.K. Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
A decision is expected by the end of September. 

Operating profit fell to #64.7 million from last year's interim #78.7 million.
