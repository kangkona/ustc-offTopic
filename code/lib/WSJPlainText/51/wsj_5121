The board of Datapoint Corp., beseiged by a group of dissident shareholders seeking to oust Chairman Asher Edelman, has set Sept. 27 as the record date for a consent solicitation. 

Shareholders of record at the close of business that day may vote on the consent solicitation, launched by minority shareholder Martin Ackerman.
Mr. Ackerman, who owns less than 5% of the computer maker's common stock, is seeking to replace Mr. Edelman and other board members -- but needs the votes of holders of more than 50% of Datapoint stock. 

In recent weeks, Mr. Edelman has increased to more than 40% the share he holds or controls.
