STRIP AWAY THE grand design.
Try ignoring the hype.
And what's left isn't a pretty picture. 

The European Community's plan to create a barrier-free market by the end of 1992 boils down to 279 nit-picky measures that have to be negotiated, debated and put into law in all 12 EC states by midnight on Dec. 31, 1992.
With legislative titles like "Chemical Properties of Toys," "General Directive on Food Additives" and "Hydraulic Diggers/Noise," the 1992 program is essentially a tedious exercise for bureaucrats. 

Although some of the most difficult problems have yet to be tackled, the countries have already agreed to about half of the 1992 program.
But from here on, the job will get slower and more controversial.
Negotiators are cutting closer to Europe's heart, to practices that make France French and Germany German. 

Here is the 1992 plan as it now stands. 

Approved Measures 

-- Capital movements: Eight of the most developed EC countries will be required to do away with all controls on capital movements by July 1, 1990.
Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland would follow later.
This would give EC residents the right to import and export currency and shop for the best deals across Europe in banking and investment services. 

-- Banking: Effective Jan. 1, 1993, banks established in one EC country will be allowed a license to open operations in any other EC country without further approval.
Other banking and financial measures effective at the same time include common levels of solvency ratios for banks and common insider-trading rules. 

-- Technical standards: In an effort to end the technical excuses for stopping goods at the border, there will be uniform basic regulations for foodstuffs, electrical appliances and industrial machines.
Most of the remaining technical measures should be agreed to by the end of this year.
Many of the regulations will go into effect before 

-- Automobile exhausts: A recent agreement sets U.S.-style pollution controls on automobiles.
The rules for cars under 1.4 liters will take effect by July 1, 1992, and for all other cars by Jan. 1, 1993. 

-- Professional recognition: Mutual recognition of professional qualifications of teachers, lawyers, doctors, engineers and other professionals has been approved and in many cases is already applicable.
Further steps are expected allowing free movement of pensioners, students and the independently wealthy (the "playboy directive"). 

Measures Where Agreement Is Likely 

-- Public contracts: Three of the seven measures aimed at opening public contracts to competition have been approved.
Further measures, expected as early as the end of this year, would apply EC competition rules to such sectors as water, energy, transportation and telecommunications. 

-- Mergers and takeovers: Proposed legislation would give the EC Commission control over mergers and takeovers with a "Community dimension," while smaller, more localized antitrust cases would be left to national governments. 

-- Television broadcasting: Though it is still controversial, the nations are likely to agree to the EC's compromise proposal on "television without frontiers" -- setting nonbinding local-content quotas on European broadcasters.
The system, watered down from the binding quotas sought by France, Belgium and several other countries, would ask that broadcasters devote a majority of their entertainment broadcasting to EC-made material. 

Sticking Points 

-- Border controls: The countries are trying to deal with the rising level of crossborder crime, terrorism and drug trafficking.
Some countries argue that removing customs checks will require an EC-wide police force such as the FBI. Different national attitudes toward immigration will also have to be blended into a single approach. 

-- Plant and animal health: EC nations will attempt to agree on a series of complex standards certifying the health of live animals and plants intended for trade.
Animal products (milk and eggs, for example) would also be subject to minimum hygiene standards. 

-- Workers' rights: Continental countries want to see minimum standards for worker protection, as well as basic standards for health and safety.
But an EC proposal for a package of workers' rights legislation, including guaranteed worker participation on the boards of companies, has hit strong opposition from Britain. 

-- Transport: Despite recent progress deregulating portions of road, sea and air transport, the remaining 1992 measures pose difficult problems.
Regulations opening up the sea-transport market, as well as similar regulations facing road carriers, have hit snags.
A new proposal opening air carriers to more competition has been put forward by the Commission, though its prospects are uncertain. 

-- Taxes: While a measure to reduce the differences in withholding-tax rates on investment income has failed to win the support of enough countries, EC officials expect to reach agreement on measures to narrow differences in indirect taxes or value-added taxes. 

-- Monetary union: Although technically not part of the 1992 program, the plan to create a single EC currency is clearly part of the 1992 bandwagon.
EC leaders have increased economic and monetary policy coordination, and an intergovernmental conference, necessary to change the EC founding Treaty of Rome, could be called by next year.
But Britain is opposed to any change in the treaty.
