Elders IXL Ltd., an Australian brewing, agribusiness, financial-services and resources company, reported that after-tax operating profit excluding abnormal items rose 37% to 615 million Australian dollars (US$476.3 million) in the fiscal year ended June 30 from A$448.6 million a year earlier. 

After including abnormal items, profit fell 5% to A$653.3 million from A$684.9 million because of unusually high abnormal earnings a year earlier.
Earnings per share, before abnormal items, rose to 34.4 Australian cents (26.6 U.S. cents) from 27.6 Australian cents, and the dividend increased to 20.5 Australian cents a share from 17.4 Australian cents.
Revenue rose 15% to A$17.65 billion from A$15.35 billion. 

Elders also announced a 1-for-6 freescrip issue. 

Directors said all operating divisions, except the agribusiness group, improved their performances.
