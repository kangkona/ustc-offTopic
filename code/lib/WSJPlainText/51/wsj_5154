THANKS TO THE DOLLAR'S relatively strong showing against the yen during the past year, the U.S. has regained a little ground from Japan in the rankings of the world's largest companies and financial institutions. 

But Japanese companies still retain the commanding lead they have built up over the past decade.
Ranking the world's 100 largest companies by stock-market value, 50 are Japanese this year, down slightly from 53 a year earlier.
That includes Nippon Telegraph & Telephone, the top-ranked company, and Industrial Bank of Japan, ranked No. 2.
By comparison, 35 of the 100 largest companies this year are U.S. concerns, one more than the year before. 

Among banks, all of the top eight are Japanese.
Citicorp squeaks in at No. 9, and Banque National de Paris rounds out the top 10.
Overall, 31 of the world's 100 largest banks are Japanese; 12 are American.
West Germany and France have, respectively, 10 and eight banks on the list. 

The U.S. fares better in the rankings of the world's largest insurance companies and securities firms. 

These are some of the findings that emerge in The Wall Street Journal's fourth annual global ranking of companies and financial institutions.
The world's 100 largest public companies were monitored by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, based in New York and Geneva.
Rankings of the 100 largest banks, 50 largest insurers and 25 largest securities firms were compiled from the Worldscope database.
Worldscope is a joint venture of Wright Investors Service, Bridgeport, Conn., and the Center for International Financial Analysis and Research in Princeton, N.J. 

The lists generally don't include state-owned entities or some closely held institutions for which data aren't available.
In some cases, 1987 data and rankings have been restated.
