Former Swiss Justice Minister Elisabeth Kopp was indicted yesterday on criminal charges of leaking official secrets to her husband in connection with a drug money investigation that led to her resignation. 

Special federal prosecutor, Joseph-Daniel Piller, said a preliminary investigation has compiled enough evidence to bring charges against Mrs. Kopp before Switzerland's supreme court. 

Mrs. Kopp, Switzerland's only woman government minister to date, is also the first to be charged in court. 

Two former subordinates also were charged with passing confidential government information. 

The supreme court first must rule whether the charges brought by Mr. Piller are well-founded enough to be receivable. 

In a statement through her public relations agent, Mrs. Kopp denied criminal wrongdoing while acknowledging she made a "mistake." 

In a telephone call last October to her husband, a lawyer, Mrs. Kopp allegedly urged him to sever ties with a Zurich-based company, Lebanese-controlled Shakarchi Trading AG, that had come under scrutiny in Switzerland's biggest drug money laundering inquiry. 

Hans W. Kopp gave up his post as Shakarchi board vice president shortly before the company was named publicly as possibly involved in the case.
No charges have been filed and Shakarchi has denied wrongdoing.
