First Banc Securities Inc. said it agreed to merge with a unit of Huntington Bancshares Inc. for a stock swap valued at about $100 million. 

Terms include converting each First Banc share into a number of Huntington Bancshares common shares, determined by a formula using the average closing price of Huntington's common during the five days prior to the accord. 

Based on Huntington's current market price, the value of the transaction is about $100 million. 

First Banc had let expire an earlier letter of intent to be acquired by Huntington for about $85 million, so that it could consider other offers. 

A final pact on the most recent offer is subject to approval by First Banc shareholders and various regulatory authorities.
But First Banc has granted Huntington a warrant to purchase 24.9% of its stock and agreed to pay up to $1 million in expenses and a cancellation fee of nearly $3 million if the proposed merger isn't completed. 

First Banc, based in Morgantown, W.Va., had $520 million in assets at the end of June and has 12 offices in West Virginia and Pennsylvania.
Huntington, a Columbus, Ohio, bank holding company with $10.4 billion of assets, has 248 offices in 11 states.
