Shawmut National Corp. said it expects third-quarter earnings per share to rise about 6% from year-earlier quarter's 85 cents, indicating quarter earnings of about 90 cents a share. 

In the year-earlier third quarter, the bank holding company posted net income of $63.2 million. 

Separately, Shawmut raised its quarterly dividend to 36 cents a share, from 34 cents, payable Oct. 20, to shareholders of record Oct. 2. 

Shawmut said preliminary estimates indicate that nonperforming assets will increase to about 2% of total loans and foreclosed properties for the quarter, compared with 1.6% in the second quarter.
The company attributed the expected increase primarily to increasing softness in the New England real-estate market. 

For the nine months, Shawmut said it expects about 10% growth in earnings per share, indicating share earnings of about $2.64 for the period.
In the year-ago nine months, the company had net of $176.5 million, or $2.40 a share. 

The company has headquarters here and in Boston.
