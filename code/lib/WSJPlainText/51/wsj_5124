Deposit Guaranty Bank, which recently won the bidding for Texas American Bridge Bank, said it plans to merge the two institutions and operate them under the name of Team Bank. 

With just under $5 billion in assets, Team Bank will be the sixth largest bank in Texas, according to the new managers, led by longtime Texas banker Ronald G. Steinhart. 

Texas American Bridge Bank was created when regulators declared the 24 banks belonging to Texas American Bancshares Inc. insolvent earlier this year.
