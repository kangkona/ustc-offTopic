Paramount Communications Inc., New York, said it acquired the occupational and remedial mathematics book lists of publisher John Wiley & Sons Inc. Terms weren't disclosed. 

Richard E. Snyder, chairman of Simon & Schuster, a unit of Paramount, said the purchase "reflects our ongoing expansion in educational publishing." The Wiley titles, which will become part of the Prentice Hall College Book Division of Simon & Schuster, include books on vocational technology, business education and criminal justice administration. 

Wiley's president and chief executive officer, Ruth R. McMullin, said the divestiture will allow Wiley "to concentrate its editorial and marketing skills and capital even more intently on projects that are consistent with our global strategy."
