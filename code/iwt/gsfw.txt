People take it for granted that fresh water can't be run out. Rain, river can be the source of fresh water. So they don't place more emphsises upon fresh water. In fact, fresh water is faced with a shortage. With the increasing of population the consumption of fresh water is increasing greatly. Meanwhile, with the development of industry, more and more water are used widely. Moreover, because the pollution became more and more serious, the total of fresh water is reducing too. What shall we do, now? Man can't live without fresh water, so we must take some measures to pretect our rare resource of fresh water. Firstly, all of us should used water economically, and never waste it any more. Secondly, we should do something to pretect water from being polluted. For an example waste water can't be poured into rivers without being cleaned. Thirdly, we should plant trees as many as possible because forest can protect water effectively. As long as all of us do our bits in protecting the resource of water. I believes that we can benefit from it more and more, and our world will be more beautiful!

People think there is plenty of water in earth. Fresh water can never be used up. Fresh water comes from rain, rivers, wells, etc. They contribute a lot of fresh water to us. Many contries are wealth in water. In fact, there is serious shortage of fresh water in earth. They spend a lot of fresh water including population increasing , polution , industry increasing etc. Shortage of fresh water is a serious problem in world. How to solve the problem of global shortage of fresh water? We should spare fresh water in our living . Government should plan to protect the resource of fresh water and control population increasing , polution , industry increasing etc.

People always think that fresh water will never be used up. Because there are many sources of water, such as the rain, river , the water of underground. . . These sources of water offer us a plenty of fresh water. In fact, fresh water is in the serious shortage. The increase of population has caused the greater and greater consumption of water. Because of the development of the industry, more and more fresh water is being used. And many factories have seriously polluted the fresh water, therefore, a great deal of fresh water becomes wasted. There are many instances that can proved the fact. So what should we do? I think we should establish some systems to control the using water of industry. We should control the rapid promotion of population. And in this case , our country has succeeded to a certain extent. In a word, we should take all kinds of measures to preserve our resource of fresh water.

Many people take it for granted that fresh water is endless . Why do they think so? Because they see that is always rains, water alway flows along the river, water in the wells never dris , and so on. So in their opinions, we needn't worry about this problem. But they are wrong. In fact, with the development of the industry, more and more fresh water is needed. At the same time, more and more fresh water is beeing polluted. We need more fresh water while less fresh water is available, so the shortage of fresh water is necessarily the case . Facing such a serious fact, what should we do? At first, I think, we should control the water pullution . Only by this means can we have a steady fresh water supplyment . At second, we should re-use the water which has been used, thus we can reduce the need for fresh water. If we can handle these two measures mentioned above correctly , we can have enough fresh water.

Many people think that fresh water is enough for human being . They think 70 per of the earth is covered with water. People can get fresh water from raining , rivers and under the floor . But in fact, fresh water is very shortage. With the development of the parpulation and industry, more and more fresh water is used. On the other hand, great pollution make fresh water become less and less. Fresh water is very important in our lives so we must pay attention to it. We must not any more waste water. Every people must know the importance of fresh water and try his best to reduce the pollution of water.

People always think that fresh water can't be used up. For example, man can get fresh water from rain, rivers, or from the underground. Since the rain, rivers. . . are considerable, the fresh water should be much more than what we can use . It sounds reasonable, but can it be ture ? In fact, great shortage of fresh water has shown up in many cities of different countries. This problem may result from several reasons: First, the population is increasing, which leads to more need for water. next , with the development of industry, the water needed in industry becomes more and more. Last , pollution becomes serious and much water from the polluted rivers can't be used. We can see that the problem of shortage of fresh water is very serious. We should think out some methods to solve it, such as controlling the population, avoiding pollution, saving water. . . . In a word, every one of us should fight against the shortage of fresh water.

Many people take it for granted that fresh water is available for ever. In fact, many people think that we can attain fresh water from many sources such as the raining-water , and the water drawed from rivers and wells. Fresh water is so common to us that many of us think that there is plenty of fresh water in the world today. However, in fact , fresh water is of rather shortage in the world today. Many factors can be accounted into . First, with the incress of the population of the world, we need more fresh water. Besides, there will be a greater demand for fresh water in industries with the progress of the modernization. The most important factor must be that we have polluted the water resource so seriously that there is less fresh water available today. In my opinion, we must take steps to deal with this problem immediately. For example, government should establish ragulations to prevent the fresh water from being polluted. Besides, scientists should invent some methods to cycle the fresh water. Furthermore, government should educate the people that fresh water is of shortage and everyone has the duty to prevent the fresh water from being polluted.

Most of people believe that fresh water can be used for ever. Since there is plentys of fresh water in rivers or from raining or under the ground, people take for granted that it is no use worrying about the shortage of fresh water. It is not necessarily the case, however. In fact, it is more and more serious of global shortage of fresh water. In the modern ages , the population increase in a great speed and water used in life and in factories increase , too. Besides, there is serious pollution in rivers. All of these facts indicate global shortage of fresh water. But how can we solve the ploblem ? Now more and more scientists pay attention to global shortage of fresh water. Some of them had thought out of many ways to it. Being members of the world, we should try our best to save water.

People have thought that fresh water is not limited. They consider that fresh water can be got from the rain, the river , the will , etc. and these resources of fresh water will never dry up, so they can use fresh water freely as they want. But they are wrong. In fact, fresh water is very scarce. On the one hand, with the increasement of porpulation and the advancement of modern industry, more and more fresh water is needed, on the other hand, the water pollution is so serious that the available fresh water is decreasing, which results in the shortage of fresh water. Time is limited. We can't stand by any more. Steps must be taken to protect the fresh water resources. Firstly, we must take actions to control the water pollution. Secondly, more attention should be paid to new technology to find ways to get new soure of fresh water. Thirdly, wasting frest water must be prohibited. All in all, something must be done to resolve the global shortage of fresh water so that we could live a better life.

Most of the people think that our fresh water can be available for ever and fresh water from rain fall , rivers or wells is easy for us to use whenever we want. As a matter of fact, fresh water is limited. And a lot of places are lacking of it. With the development of world's population, more and more fresh water is required to meet people's demand. Recently, fresh water for industry is increasing rapidly. Owing to the pollution in rivers, lakes, and other water resources, the problem of being lack of fresh water gets more and more serious. What should do to prevent this problem from developing more seriously? First of all, we should not waste fresh any longer. In order to make people aware of it, we'd better take measures to educate people. Secondly, we're to make laws and rules to punnish those persons who pollute water without thinking about the others. Thirdly, we hope scientists can find efficient ways to recycle water or make use of new water resource such as the ice in Atlantic. We hope in the coming future, human beings can use fresh water more efficiently and derive enough water from our glob .

People take it for granted that fresh water can be unlimitted used. There is plenty of fresh water in the Antarctica. And fresh water may also come from rain and snow. There is fresh water in rivers, too. We can see fresh water everywhere! We don't bother to worry that it will be used up someday. However, global shortage of fresh water is a serious problem now. As the increase of population and the development of industry, fresh water is polluted and used . Clean water becomes less and less. The living envioronments are being damaged. Human being will dye out when the day comes that there is no fresh water at all. In order to guard the glob and to protect ourselves, we should save fresh water as possible as we can. And we are supposed to plant more trees to keep the fresh water underground . The waste produced by industry should be done away with before it goes into rivers. Thus, we may have a beautiful world with plenty of fresh water.

People always believe that fresh water is more than we can use up. They say that fresh water will never be over. Fresh water comes from raining and river. Fresh water is the only water that is fits for us to drink. In fact, fresh water is in global shortage. With the population increasing and with factories using more and more water, Fresh water becomes litter and litter . On the other hand, more and more fresh water can't be drink because it is poluted by factories. So in my conclusion, we can't waste fresh water. A litter drop of fresh water is very important for us. Some measure should be taken to protect fresh water.

When we talk about water, many person perphaps think that water is enough to use. From their eyes, rivers, seas, streams and rain are all the source of the useful water. It's right that the ocean surface occupies over 70 persentage of the earth surface. The total volume of water is very enormous. But the water we can use is very shortage. Because we only can use fresh water. What make the shortage of fresh water? There are following factors. The first one is that the population of the earth is increasing very quickly. The overcrowed population makes the average volume of water is decreasing. The second one is that industrial water's quantity is increasing, which makes a lot of waste water. The third one is the most serious, the water polution is expanding. Because of these factors, fresh water turn less and less. How can we resolve the problem? First, we should slow down industrial water. Second, we should protect our environment, and discrease the polution of water. Third, we should save our life water. Generally speaking, we must try our best to preserve our fresh water, otherwise, we maybe slip into danger.

As we know, may creatures drink and use fresh water. Without fresh water, we could not survive. Fresh water lies in wells, rivers, lakes and rain. On some point , snow and ice can be converted into fresh water. It is well known that there are a lot of icebergs in the earth. In addition, someone thinks there is much under-ground water. So people think fresh water is enough to use. In fact, however , we are short of fresh water. On one hand, with the development of population and industry, the need of fresh water is increasing. What's more, pollution wastes plenty of fresh water. On the other hand, fresh water is stored partly in icebergs which is used very difficultly . Then, how can we do to deal with the problem? Certainly, we should save fresh water and do our bit to reduce the use of water in industry.

People always think that fresh water will not be used up forever. There are many kinds of fresh water on the Earth . We can get fresh water from rain, river , well , etc. It seems that we can get fresh water easily when it is necessary. In fact fresh water is very shortage on the Earth . On one hand, there isn't so much fresh water available on the Earth , as people had thought about . On the other hand, we need more and more fresh water. The porpulation is increasing. Fresh water use in industry is increasing. Polution keeps on making more and more fresh water unexistant . What should we do? We shall find more fresh water. The most important thing is we shall save fresh water and use it efficiently. We should use fresh water when it is necessary. Wasting water is a crime to our sociaty .

People always think that water can be used endlessly. People think that water is in anywhere, rain, rivers, lakes and snow mountains. They think that water is enough to use. Actually water is short. Water is not enough to use today. The number of the people in the earth, is rising; The water of industry is rising; pollution of water is more and more serious. . . All these show that water is getting shorter. In modern society, global shortage of fresh water is a big problem. What should we do now? Of course, we must deal with the problem and manage it. Water is very important to us. First, we prevent water from being pollute,. so we can have fresh water. Second, we control the population of people , so we can have enough water. Lastly, we must not waste water. This is very important, we should remember it and do it . When all of us have done them , water will be fresh and enough. The problem will be managed in the end.

People always think that fresh water will never be used up. There exist many rivers and lakes on the earth. It rains a lot in some regions. And even in desserts we can drill deep wells to get fresh water. It appears that we can get fresh water quite easily. But as a matter of fact, we are in global shortage of fresh water. Population of many countries keeps increasing, and many industries thrive by and by . All these call for a larger amount of fresh water. On the other hand, water pollution becomes more and more serious today. As a result, water that can be used is getting less. Mensures should be taken to preserve our fresh water resources. We should make efforts to control water pollution. Moreover, we should economize on using fresh water in our daily life.

A lot of people think that the fresh water will be never out of run, for over 80 percent of the earth surface are covered with water. Furthermore, the rivers the wells and even the annual falling water are the sources of our daily lives. In effect it is not true. The fact is that we are short of fresh water. The reasons are as follows: first of all, with the increasing of the population, more and more people need fresh water which is limitted to human beings, so it results in our urgent using of fresh water. Second, to support so many people to live, it is necessary for us to develope more and more materials and to develope our industry and agricultury which come out , depending on water. Finally, may be the most important, is the pollution. Every day, thousands of factories and plants poured thousands of wastes into water before being purified. As a result, the rivers, the lakes and so on are polluted and unfit for people to drink, to use, to irrigate. The fresh water seems to be lessened to us. What shall we do? The scientists all over the world put emphasis on the problem and come up with series of solvations . Nowadays, not only governments but also the people begin to face the problem and are determined to solve it. Many rivers are cleaned and reused . Maybe some time we can use plenty of fresh water conveniently. That day, I believe, is not very far off .

Many people believe that fresh water is never used out. Because there are all kinds of fresh water here and there. For example, the rain water is the major source of fresh water, and it rains many times every year. Besides, other kinds of fresh water, such as river water, well water, lake water and so on, are avaliable easily . But as a matter of fact, the fresh water is very shortable . For one thing, the population of the earth is increasing greatly every year, which calls for a great demand for fresh water. For another, with the development of the socioty , the industry has improved greatly. And as a result, factories need more fresh water than before. Finally, and what is the worst, the water pollution is becoming serious and serious. As it is know , more and more fresh water is wasted or converted to durty water every day. What should we do to solve this problem? Fresh water is never too much for us all to use, so we must protect fresh water source. First of all, we all should be educated to realize that fresh water is very important to us and it is now in global shortage. We should be conscious of saving fresh water. On the other hand, we should try our best to improve the method of converting sea water into fresh water, so that the sea water can be made good use of. In general, we should save our fresh water and improve our fresh water to solve this problem.

People often take it granted that fresh water can not be used up. For example, people use amount of fresh water in a waste way. In normal life, people pay no care in using fresh water because they think there are great deal of raining water, riverwater , well water on the earth. In fact, fresh water is very shortage. It may lie in serval factors: the increase of popullation , the increase use of industries and pollution. With those factors, the use of fresh water is increase . espencilly , pollution is the big reason the fresh water can reused. It makes fresh water become less than before. How should we do? In my opinions . First. It is important that the public are to be educated that fresh water is shortage, we should be economical in using it. Second, the genverment should set up a law to project fresh water, forbidden to waste fresh water. Finally, scietists would make their best to research the resource of fresh water for people.

People think that fresh water won't be used up. Because there are hundreds of thousands of rivers, we can drain water from them. If there are no rivers, people can drill a hole and use water from underground. Besides, rain is another source of fresh water. But in fact fresh water is in global shortage. As the population increases, the fresh water used in living also increases. And with the development of modern industry, A great deal of water is used in industry. Meanwhile, the water pollution makes the water available less. What shall we do? I think, first, we must must use the water with more cares and mustn't waste water. Second we must protect the water sources from being polluted. Third we must find new sources of fresh water such as turning sea-water into fresh water. Only in these ways can we solve the problem of fresh water shortage.

Some people think that there is enough fresh water for us, and we can't use it up. You see, there is fresh water everywhere, in the rivers in the lakes, in the wells, and it's rain often. But in fact, fresh water is short of for us. Firstly there is more and more people today, so we need more fresh water, but fresh water can not increase just as the increasing of the population. Furthermore, fresh water is less than before now, for more fresh water is used by factories, and a lot of fresh water is polluted, for instance, the water in Xingjian is not fit for drinking now. We have to drink fresh water and we have to develop indusitry . So we must do something for ourselves. We ought to use as little as we can, do not waste a drop of water. We ought to make people know the global shortage of fresh water, We must prevent the factories from polluting the water. I think we ought to find out fresh water sources too, it's way for more water. But the most important I mean is: do not waste a drop .

People generally believe that fresh water is never used up because we human beings can get fresh water by various means. For example, the rivers, the wells, even the rain can provide us much fresh water. In fact, there is a global shortage of fresh water in the world. First, the population is rising so quickly that the used fresh water increases. Secondly, the industrial water increases. Thirdly, in many countries, fresh water has been badly polluted with dangerous chemicals. If we want to have a bright future, we must take measures now. In fact, we can pass many new laws to clean the water, and to control the rapid increase of the population in the world. It is also important for us to be enconomical of water. Thus , the fresh water in the world will soon increase .

Most people always think that the fresh water is as much as what they need. They think that they can get the fresh water from the rivers, raining water and so on. So they wasted a lot of fresh water. In fact, fresh water is very shortage. With the addition of the population, people will need more and more fresh water. On the other hand, the polution and the industrial factory will also waste plenty of fresh water. All these make the problem of fresh water serious. Then, what should we do? How can we solve the problem? The first, we must know that the fresh water is rare and we must use it carefully. This is the most important. Second, we can make the water resyole . Only we pay more attention to this, there will be more ways to solve the problem.

In people's eyes, fresh water can not be used up. We are able to get fresh water by different means. For example, there are a lot of fresh water in rivers. And raining can also produce much fresh water. Furthermore, people have used the fresh water underground . But in fact fresh water is in an urge short now. It is caused by many reasons. First, the population of the world is increasing too fast. Second, modern industry needs more and more fresh water. Third, fresh water has been seriously polluted. Aside from these, there are many other reasons. Then what shall we do? Above all, I think, we must forbbid to waste water. At the same time we must decrease the pollutions . We should let the rivers become clear again. By and large let all of us work hard to find ways to protect fresh water.

People often think that fresh water can't be used out. They can see the water of rain, river and well every where, so they think there is a lot of fresh water in earth. They needn't worry about global shortage of fresh water. In fact, fresh water is global shortage at present. With the development of industray and the increasing population, people must use more and more fresh water. Moreover, the pollution of fresh water becomes more and more serious. A great deal of fresh water is polluted and can not be use . In short, the problem of global shortage of fresh water is very serious. So we must take measures to protect fresh water. We ought to instruct people not to waste fresh water, in order to give a best gift to our next generation.

It is well-known that about 70% of the earth's surface is covered with water. And every day we can see a lot of water, such as the rain falling down around us, the rivers flowing quietly through the city and the water in the wells which dug long ago, and even the seas, the falls . . . . So many people believe that the fresh water is never to be used out, and they can get it whenever they want. Actually, the fresh water in our globe is in shortage. With the growing of the population and the industries, more and more fresh water is required to keep up with the steps of the development. The resource of water is limited, the more used, the less left. But many people haven't realized it yet. They wastes water in large quatity and purse the polluted water into the rivers, and as a result, we take the water out from the river to drink. In many countries, the shortage of fresh water is very serious, and it must depend on the water supply from other countries. In concludsion we can learn that we men must take a serious look on the shortage of fresh water and try our best to stop wasting and polluting water. Many scientists are thinking of ways to use the ice on top of the mountains, but that's not a solution, in the most important, all people on our earth should do our best to protect our fresh water.

People often take it for granted that fresh water is limitless. We can get the fresh water from a lot of ways. For example the fresh water we use in our daily life comes from the river . The rain is also the source of fresh water. In fact, we are short of fresh water. With the increase of population the fresh water is becoming more and more important. The factory need more and more fresh water to improve the number of their products. In addition, a lot of fresh water is polluted so the fresh water is less. We should take measure to protect our fresh water, in case it is polluted more seriously. We should control the development of the population. Only we have done these can we have more and more fresh water.

People had thought that fresh water couldn't be used up because there were so many rivers and wells around us. As we all know, the global is covered by water, land and mountains, and water is the major part. We can get fresh water from rivers, pools and wells, even from rains. It is no sense worring about the shortage of fresh water. Is it true that fresh water can't be used up? Of course the answer is certainly negation . In fact, the fresh water is limited and even short of. With the development of the society, the global is facing with the problem of larger number of population and of promotting development of industry and agriculture. The living use, industrial use and other use of fresh water is increasing at a high speed. Second, with the development of industry, the pollution problem has been brought out. The waste water has been sent to the rivers so that the polluted water in the river is unfit to drink or use. Fresh water becomes less and less, in the same time the demands for fresh water are larger and larger, so the shortage of fresh water forms . What can we solve this problem? First, I think, is to educate people to use fresh water economically. Families and factories should not waste water. Second, scientists should come up with ways to develop the reusing of fresh water. Last , countries should make measure to protect the oceans, rivers, to prevent them from being polluted. We should be hard on those who pollute the rivers. If we all realize the importance of fresh water and make good use of it, it can contribute our society a lot.

People always think fresh water will not be used up, for it can come from raining , river , dill and so on. Consquently , many people use fresh water in a wasted way. In fact, fresh water is very short. Let us have a look. Population increases more and more. It means less fresh water being suplying to more person . On earth more factories are built up. So the water used in industry increases. And pullution makes fresh water into harmful water. Then what can we do? First, we must pay attention to the global shortage of fresh water. Second, we must make measures to deal with this problem. We must use fresh water in a right way. Don't waste it any more. In the other hand, we should controll the population and prevent the pollution.

People tend to take it for granted that fresh water is an unlimited source. What makes them think so is largely because they can see water without difficulty. They have no trouble finding water in rivers, lakes and wells. In some tropical areas, there is plenty of rain as well. In fact, people are in need of fresh water to a great extent . This mostly lies in the following factors. First, an increase in population makes the shortage of fresh water available. Second, rapidly advancing industry takes up quite a considerable proportion of fresh water in use. Third, water pollution leads to the fact that much water is greatly polluted and they can no more be used. Measures must be taken to "save" fresh water. Laws should be put into effect. But most important of all, people must pay more attention to the use of fresh water. They must not waste water any more. Then, we will make better use of water and make a better world.

People think that water is enough for us to use. We can use the water from rain, rivers, wells and lakes and so on. People think that water can renew and use again. It is not necessary that we worry about the shortage of fresh water. In fact, the fresh water is not enough for us to use. People must use water every day. So do the industry. The population is increasing and the industry demands more and more water. The water pollution is getting worse and worse. The shortage of fresh water is getting more and more serious. Facing the important problem, what should we do? We must have a experience of water-cut . So we must save every drop of water. I think the government should build some plants that do with the dirty water and should make some laws reduce the water pollution. On the other hand, we can plant many trees to clean the water that is polluted.

Fresh water is limitedless , which human beings always take for granted. It seems to be true. When it rains, rainwater become our fresh water. People also can draw fresh water out of wells, rivers, underground. Even we can transfer ice blocks from Antarctic as fresh water to us. But, as a matter of fact, the condition is not as same as we have thought. In fact, there is shortage of fresh water on the earth. As the population on the earth increases, the use of fresh water also follows to increase. Moreover, industries make use of fresh water in large quantities, especially in producing paper mills, textile factories. And their flowing waste water pollutes nearby rivers and streams, which reduces sources of people's drink water. So the situation of fresh water is out of opimestic . So , what should we do about that ? First, people should treasure water. We can make full use of fresh water as much as possible . Second, industries should clean the waste water to flow into rivers. Third scientists have to creat new method to increase the water supply. In a word, all natural resources on the globe are scarce. Human beings have to treasure them and make full use of them.

People usually think that fresh water is not used up for ever. Even some people think that there is enough fresh water to use for ever. Why do people think so? Because there is a lot of fresh water around us. So we are not aware of that fact that fresh water is short. In fact, fresh water is very short. There are many reasons of shortage of fresh water. First, the fresh water is very limited. Second, we need more and more water because the number of people is increasing. Third, a lot of fresh water is poluted . In a word, fresh water is short. What should we do? First, we should not waste fresh water. Second, we try to use the fresh water that we already used .

People take it for granted that fresh water would never be running out of . Because there are so many water resources such as the rain dropped from the heaven, the water in rivers, in wells, and even the water undergrounded . It seems that the earth is abound with fresh water. Actually, the fresh water is in a shortage. With the increased population, more and more people share in the limited fresh water. Because of the development of industry, the consumption of water has risen to a considerable quantity. And the worst thing is that water pollution has done a great damage to the pure fresh water. In a word we are facing a serious situation of the global shortage of fresh water. What should we do to deal with this problem? I think there are several possible steps we should take. We must take measures to bring the water pollution under control, laws should be made to prohibit the factories from dumping poisonous substance into the river. We must also strengthen the practice of family-planning , so as to control the consumption of fresh water. In addition, we ought to call on people to realize the shortage of fresh water and to use it economically. In this way, we are bound to solve the shortage of fresh water

Generally, people thought that it was lots of fresh water resources. They thought it was a lot of rain whick can offer a good many fresh water. Some thought that the rivers can offer much more water, and they also thought it's easy to get fresh water throught a well. In fact, we're seriously short of fresh water. For example, the rapidly increasing population require more and more fresh water, for another example, the factories expanding quickly, they used a large number of water, to make things worsely , they polluted many water resources. So, what we should to do these problems ? Firstly, we should form a habit of not wasting water. Secondly, government should carry on some measures to prevent the factories from polluting our rivers. Only following these, we can really have the endless fresh water.

People take it for granted that fresh water will never be used up. Somebody believe that there are lots of sources to produce fresh water, such as rain, river , well . So, they think that it doesn't matter to waste some water. In fact, though someone regards our earth as water-globe , fresh water is very limited. The population increases quickly, factorical water has been improved, the used of fresh water enlarges. On the contrary, Pollution has broken the balance of nature, the fresh water reduces greatly. Therefore, we must protect the water sources and use the water limitedly . First, we must deal with the pollution, Second, population control must be done immediately. Altogether, we should do our best to resolve the shortage of fresh water. I believe we can do it.

Many people have an oppion that we can use fresh water according to our need. In other word , they think fresh water is enough for us to use. For these people they alway say in a indifferent appearance that people can get a great deal of water from rain, lake and from well . This may seems well , but we often faced a problem: if the lake or the river is dry, what the people could depend on? In fact, we can see the fresh water is very shortage. Scientists have draw a conclusion from many facts that the average people's use fresh water is decreasing. In mordern society, with the devolping of population and the increasing of industry's need, fresh water have become more and more rare . In addtion , the pollution also make people face the difficulty of shortage of fresh water. When we relize this fact, I think no one can say we have enough fresh water. When we realize the serious of shortage of fresh water we must do our best to prevent it. Firstly, we must save every drop of water, for example, not let the water flowing when you go away. Secondly, the measures must be taken to prevent fresh water from pulluting , and we must controll the population in the world. Thirdly, with the devolping of science, we can use water from sea that have been changed into fresh water or use the ice to restore the fresh water. In a word, every people must responsible for saving water.

Most people think that fresh water can be obtained for ever. We can obtain fresh water from rivers, lakes and wells. Raining brings us plenty of fresh water every year. Melted snow is a source of fresh water too. But in fact fresh water is in shortage. Because the world's population increases, more and more people need to use fresh water. With the industry development, a great deal of fresh water is used. What's more, water pollution makes much water unfit to use any more. So there isn't enough fresh water for every people in the world. We must find a way to get through the shortage of fresh water. We must not waste water when we don't need it. We can find some methods to cut down the industrial use of water. It is very important for us to protect the water source in case it might be polluted. If we do something to improve the shortage of fresh water now, I think we can use plenty of clean fresh water in future.

Most of people all over the world think that there would be adquate fresh water how matter they use. It is true that there are a large number of fresh water, include water of rain, water of rain , and so on. Therefore, they take it for granted that they should use the fresh water freely. In fact, the word is very shorted of fresh water, with the increasing population and the pollution of river, fresh water become more and more rare . Moreover, the industrial water is used increasly . Not only people but also plants need fresh water. The earth become hotter and hotter, so that it will rain less than ever. All of these factors indicated that fresh water can't used up as some people imagine. Some people would be at a loss to deal with it. First, it is important for us to reconize the short of fresh water. Second, we should be economical while we are using fresh water.

Many people think that fresh water will not be used up for ever. We can get it from rivers, wills , or from rain water. So we can use it freely. In fact, however , human beings are facing the global shortage of fresh water. With the increasing of population and the developement of industry, our need of fresh water is rising rapidly. To the worst, some of the limited water we can used is polluted. What shall we do then? First, we must use fresh water economically. Secondly, something must be done to prevent the water resource from being polluted. Scientist must find new ways to reuse the water.

People always think that fresh water will never be used up because of rains and plenty of water in the rivers. It sounds reasonable, but the fact is not so. Popullation increases quickly. Many factors need more water and plenty of fresh water is polluted. We need more and more fresh water and we are in global shortage of fresh water. Fresh water is shortage and important, so we can't waste water and must try our best to protect the limited sourace of fresh water. Otherwise, we will have no fresh water one day and we all will die.

People think that fresh water can't be used up. There are much water in rivers, lakes and so on. The wells also offer us the water, which we live on. Perhaps we can gain plenty of fresh water from rain. In fact, we are short of fresh water. On the one hand, the population in the world grows rapidly in recent years. The industry which has accelerated its development requires more and more water. On the other hand, when people use water, they aren't economical. Furthermore the dirty poisonous things pollute the water somewhere . What should we do to deal with such thing ? Firstly we must cut down the high birth rate. Secondly the sum of water which we use everyday should be controlled. Thirdly we should improve the process of production in factories and they mustn't give off any dirty things in the rivers or lakes.

Water is the source of our life. however , people often believe that the fresh water can't be shortage for ever, because there is a lot of rainwater in a whole year, there are a good many rivers in our country, and there are quite a few well here and there. People also take it for granted that the fresh water can be reused for ever. In fact, the fresh water is very shortage in earth. With the increasing of population and the factories, more and more fresh water should be asked for . And the water which is polluted is increasing. In a word, fresh water is shortage. But, what can we do for it? In my opinions, first, we should quite aware of the shortage of the fresh water and preserve its source. Second, we should not wast it.

People take it for grant that the fresh water is endless. We can get it from the rains, rivers and wells. We can find it all around us every day. But one second thoughts, we are in global short of fresh water in fact. With the increasing population, more people will use water. And the fast development of the industary puts a heavy burden on the fresh water supply. On the other hand, some people populte the fresh water by throwing rubbish into the river . It worsen the situation. Something we must do to improve the situation. First, we should not waste fresh water and use it in proper ways. Second, we must stop poluting water by establishing laws. In all , we are in global shortage of fresh water and we must take measures to preserve it.

People always thinks the fresh water can be used and will be reduced forever. Some peoples consider that there is water around us, such as river water, rain water and water under earth. They say water is so wide and abundant that we don't worrie about shortage of fresh water. In fact, however , the fresh water is serious short. Thought there is a lot of water on the earth, the available water is small for the quantity. With the development of industry, a number of water has been polluted. This water which is drunk by the human beings cause all kinds of disease , even death. The other hand, the population increases largely, so the fresh water is used increasely , adding the water of industry use, but our resource of water is limited, all these make the supply of water short and sense . So we must do something to solve the problem of shortage of water. First, we should save the fresh water, even a drip . This must depend on education and broadcast . Second, we must make the best of water. This need to use advanted science.

The surface of the earth is greatly covered by water, so many people regard that fresh water can't be used up. They think such a fact that there are many rivers and much rain in the world. In fact, the earth is faced with the global shortage of fresh water. With increasing population, the sum of water used by people is quickly increasing. And on account of the development in industry, the water used by factories become more and more. Moreover, some fresh water is polluted by the waste things thrown by people and factories , so fresh water is very scarce on the earth. What should we do to resolve the shortage of fresh water? First, everyone should learned about the situation. It is necessary for government to educate people not to waste water. Second, the factories have to discrease the pollution.

Many people think that fresh water resource is rich and fresh water can not be used up. People can gain fresh water from the rain, the rivers and the wells and so on. But in fact the global shortage of fresh water is serious. What cause it? The reason is obvious. First, with the population's increasing the fresh water consumpation is increasing. Second, the fresh water which is used in industry is also increasing. Finally, the water pollution make the fresh water become less and less. So we must realize the problem and try our best to solve it. And how should we do to solve the problem? We must take some measures to decrease the waste of fresh water. For example, we could apply the law to confine the increasing of population, water consumpation of industry and prevent the fresh water from polluting . We believe that with our effort the problem can be best solved.

People always think fresh water won't be use up: Yes , the surface of the earth is covered by water of a large part , more than 70% and their are 97% of water in weight of the earth surface but the water is not the same as fresh water only 3% of the water is fresh water, the fresh water is in the rains, rivers and wells. In fact our fresh water is shortage. because populations increase mordern industries need a lot of fresh water and water pollutions become more and more serious nowadays. How can we deal with the shortage of fresh water, the first thing is that we must save water. It can help us to control the fresh water shortage, but save is not enough, now scientists are busy searching a good method to produce water, that is to clean the used water for reuse in this system, we won't use up our fresh water.

Many people think fresh water is abundant and endless. It rains now and then. And there is water in rivers, streams. They said there is water under the earth and man can thrill for fresh water too. In fact, fresh water is very shortage. The increase of population and the development of industry have been using more and more water. And most of all, the pollution of the fresh water is more and more serious. Many rivers and streams have been polluted deeply. So the water becomes harmful and poisionons . Today, in many cities, fresh water are shortage more and more serious, and many people can not use full fresh water. This has cause a lot of problems. Then, what we should do to solve this problem? To our delight, many people have been aware of this. We can controll the pollution of the water. For one thing, we can clean the polluted water in factory before draining it out. For another, we must use fresh water economically. This can save much water. And we can plant trees to protect the environment and controll the increase of population.

People always think that fresh water will never be used up. Because almost from everywhere we live in we can get it very easily. Rivers' water, wells' water and even rain drops are fresh water actrually . Fresh water maybe the most familiral thing to us. In fact, global shortage of fresh water is very serious now. The increasing of population demands more fresh water to surport man's living. The fast development of mordern industries needs more fresh water too. On the other hand, the pollusion of fresh water has become a serious problem to our society. Many people have not concious of the importance of preserving our sourse of fresh water and many people are even wasting fresh water. How can we do with the problem then? First step , I think, is to make everyone consious of the importance of fresh water to mankind and tell them about the shortage of fresh water. When it's necessary, a plan or a law to limit the improper using of fresh water should come into power . Because fresh water is so important to us that we should preserve it by all means.

People always think that there is plenty of fresh water for us to use. For you see, it often rains, the rivers are full of water, and some places are caught in flood disaster. Is there enough water for us to use? Actually, we are in short of fresh water supply. With the development of population, more and more fresh water is demanded for people to drink, to wash. . . . And there are more factories which can't produce products without water. What's more, with the development of population and industry, more and more waste is poured out into rivers while more water are demanded. No water, there is no life. What can we do to deal with such problem ? The government's resposonbility is to make law on factories to force their pouring out waste on special place . And the local authorities shoul make people recongnize the threate of the shortage of fresh water. Every one of us should do his bit to protect the water recource , and plant more trees. Personally, I think it's important for us to save water. Fresh water play a important in our lives.

People often take it for granted that fresh water will never run out. We can find water everywhere easily, such as rain, water in the rivers, water from the wells, and so on. People usually attach little importance water. But, in fact, fresh water is limited, it will run out, if we don't pay enough attention to the use of fresh water. With the sharp increase of population, people must drink and use more water. With the inclease of the amount of water the industry needs, and the worse move of pollution, fresh water resources are urgently in short of. In our country, with the development of the national economy, we are in great need of fresh water. How should we do? I think we must take the following measures to protect fresh water resources. First, we should enhance the consciousness of environmental protection, call for the public not to waste water. Second, the central government should make a series of laws to prevent water pollution and protect fresh water resources. Third, the government at all levels must invest more funds in fresh water protection, such as taining talents for enviromental prolection , planting more trees and so on.

People think that fresh water is never used up. Because we can get fresh water from rain, river and underground. And these water resources are never used up, so we can use fresh water without any trouble . In fact, there is a global shortage of fresh water today. With the development of industry, many factories use more fresh water than before, and these factories also give off wasted-water , so fresh water is sharply polluted. And these years, population has increased quickly, and fresh water is used by more and more people. Facing these problems, how should we do? I think that we should not waste fresh water, and we should prevent factories from giving off wasted-water . If we try our best to do , I believe that the global shortage of fresh water will be disappeared soon.

Many people believe that the fresh water on the earth is endless for man to use. They can derive fresh water from rainfall , rivers, wells, underground and so on. They just know that three quarters of the surface of the earth is coverd with water while ignore that a great amount of it is sea water, which can not be drunk and used. As a matter of fact, global shortage of fresh water does exit. We are in great need of fresh water. With the rapid growth of global population, far more fresh water is needed for people's daily life. They drink it to survive, use it to do some washing and cleaning, use it to water their gardens and so on. Furthermore, with the dramatic development in industry, the amount of fresh water used for production increases accordingly. And what worries people most is that a considerable amount of fresh water has been polluted. Being faced with such a serious and urgent problem, what should we do? First, we should try our best to prevent the fresh water from being polluted. Second, researches should be done to come up with more practical and effective ways to turn sea water into fresh water. Therefore , more fresh water is available for us to use. Third, we should use water economically so that less water is wasted. In a word, we should value the limited fresh water.

People think that fresh water is enormous and can not be used up. For almost every day we can see fresh water in the rivers as well as in wells. And often we can see fresh water falling from the shy in the form of rain. So most of us don't think that there is any problem in using fresh water, and frequently some people waste plenty of fresh water in their daily life. As a matter of fact, the fresh water is in a global shortage. With the development of our society, the population of the world is increasing. The fresh water used in industry is increasing too. And more seriously, the pollution on fresh water is threatening us. The global shortage of fresh water is up to date . So I think that we should be more careful when we use fresh water. And factories especially the big factories should use fresh water more economical and be careful not to pollute it.

People always think fresh water won't be used to an end . There is enough water, such as rain water, river water, in some areas near ocean . In some desert countries or areas, lots of underground water exit. So people think fresh water can be used for ever. Actually, fresh water is very short. First, population increasing makes people consume more fresh water. Secondly, industry developing causes much more fresh water be used than ever. Thirdly, pollution all over the world changes a lot of fresh water into useless water. Water famine exits in many countries, such as Middle East countries, African countries and include China. We must take some measures to releave the global shortage of fresh water. First, we should make everyone realize the shortage of fresh water, call on people don't waste water. Secondly, we should control and deal with the pollution, protect our fresh water resource. Thirdly, we can develop our science to find new ways to produce fresh water. At last , controlling population and planting trees are very important, too .

People always think fresh water can not be used up. There are so many kinds of fresh water such as rain, river water, well water and so on. How can we be running out of fresh water? In fact, we are in global shortage of fresh water. For one thing, with the increasing of population, we need more fresh water than before. For another thing, as a result of the development of industry more fresh water is badly demanded. Moreover, more and more rivers have been polluted because some factories pour waste water into rivers without purifying them. Thus, the polluted water can not be used. So it is time that we took measures to solve the problem. First, we should pohibit factories to pour waste water into river . Second, we should find an efficient way to purify the waste water, so we can reuse them. What is most important is to draw on the sea water. If we can convert salt water into fresh water, we will not be afraid of the shortage of fresh water.

People take it for granted that Fresh Water will never be used up. Rain-water river-water and well-water etc, all these are Fresh Water. This is true. And they think they are infinite, since the sky would rain and there always are a lot of underground water. They can be used as far as you are willing to. They will never be dry, never be short . With these ideas, people never think of saving fresh water, never think that one day there will be a shortage of fresh water. In fact, fresh water is limited. With the economic developping , the population has been increasing very quickly, more and more people use fresh water. On the other hand using water of industry is growing. More and more factories came out to use water, and the demand of water is rising. In addition, the polution problem is becoming more and more serious. And amount of fresh water is being poluted everywhere. How can we do? How should we do to improve the situation? First, I think we must strengthe to educate people, to let them know the serious situation now, to let them know the shortage of fresh water and the importance to saving water. Second, we must confine the industry using water and guide the factories to saving water as far as possible. And we must stop the polution of water. At last , we must look for other origin , look for new water that can be used and pay attention to the recycle of used-water .

Most people think that fresh water could never run out. There are many resources of fresh water, such as rain, rivers, wells water and so forth. And some people think that fresh water can be recycled, we can use it again and again, just make it clean before using it. So the shortage of fresh water seems impossible to them. But in fact, there is a serious shortage of fresh water in this world. The great increasing of popullation make the fresh water not enough for using . There is too many people depend on those limited water resources. Since this grobal is getting more and more industrialized, a great number of water is used for producing . As a result, some factories put the used water into river , and make it poisoned and can't be used again. River pollution, rain pollution such as acid rain are obstacles to our suvivals . What we should do and must do is to control the waste of fresh water. we must save every single drop of fresh water. Some polluted-wated factories must be forbitted to clean the water before put them into the rivers. Water shortage is a vital thing, we must save water for our survival.

People think water will not be run cut . In other words, we will have water use without end. We gather rain to use. We can use river-water, underground-water, etc. But in fact, We are very shortage of the water. Water on the earth is limited. But, the populace is rise rapidly. With the development of industority , water to be used in industry is on raise , therefore, much water is polluted and cann't be used again. Faced with the shortage of water, we must take action. The most importance measure is saving up water all over the world: we must attach importance to the water pollution, too. We can develop new ways of using water, and improve the circle of water. With the help of the socience , we can deal with this question completely.

Clothes, food, water and shelter is our basic needs. Among them, fresh water is the most important. People always have an attitude that fresh water will not be used up. We are already used to get it from the rain, the rivers the wells and so forth. But is it the truth that we will never be short of fresh water? In effect , the fact has a contray side. Fresh water is so limited that some scientists have alermed us of its serious shortage. As the development of industry, many times of water is needed now. The other actor is the sharply increasing population. But the most important one is the water pollution. As someone's ignorance , they poured some poison material into the water. And it led to the whole river or lake useless. Though the govement have forbidden them to do so, the accidents like this are still occure from now to then. And now, we have lost many sources of water because of its pollution. How to solve the problem? First, I think we should reduce the quality of using water. Secondly, the water pollution must be held back by serce means. And we also should try to find som more water sources to meet human beings needs.

Water is very important to us. If there is no water we will die. There is plenty of water in rivers, lake and so on. When it rains, there is plenty of rain . So people always think that there is plenty of fresh water and we could use it no limited . In fact, there is short of fresh water. First, the population is increase in many countries, especialy in developing countries. Second, industry needs plenty of water. Third, today, the pollution is serious problem , and more and more rivers and lakes are polluted so the fresh water are short. To face this problem what we can do? As long as we don't waste fresh water, I think, we can avoid this problem. In addition, we must deal with the pollution. We must settle the problem.

When we reach the seaside, we think that water is enough for humenbeing for ever. But as we know, only fresh water can be used to wash, cook and so on. And someone think the fresh water is enough too. Fresh water can be got from river and from under the land . When it's raining fresh water can be got easily. Now we shall pay attention to the shortage of fresh water. With the increase of population and munber of factories, more and more fresh water is needed. But many rivers and lakes have been anxiouly poluted . Even rain in some places is not fresh now. If we don't try our best to solute those problem , we can't suvive from the shortage. The most important thing is creaseing the polution . On the other hand, we shall try to use sea water instead of fresh water or get fresh water from sea. The god will not send us a new earth, but we can build a new earth by ourselves.

As we all known , fresh water is an essential source in our daily life. There is no human being if there is no fresh water. But many people think that the fresh water can be used for good, which is out of the fact. Nowdays , we are facing with the problem of global shortage of fresh water. It was reported that fresh water is only 0. 03% of total of water on the earth, while the growing population and the developing industry and agricalture need much more water, especially fresh water--- It is a chief cause of shortage of fresh water. In addition, water pollution being on increase accounts partly for the present state of shortage of fresh water. Facing with this problem, we should prevent fresh water from being pollutted , and use the fresh water efficiently.

People thought that fresh water won't be shorten. Because the rain, the water of river and well are all the recources . In fact, we are very shortage of fresh water because of the increasing of the population, the using of factories and pollution etc. Furthermore, we need more fresh water following the development of socity . Where there is no water there is no life. Water is most importante for us in our dairy life. We use it anytime and anywhere. But, what can we do facing the facts of these? This is a serious problem for all of us to pay large attention to.

Some people think fresh water is adequate for use. They think water is full of the world. When it rains, we will have fresh water. And water in river and in well is also adequate. In fact, fresh water is short. Since the population increases, people need much water in daily life. With many new factories being built, the need of water in industry goes up. And worst of all, fresh water is being pollouted by waste water and garbage. What shall we do about global shortage of fresh water? We shall use water properly, and can not waste it. Then, we shall prevent fresh water from being polluted. Besides, we shall find out new source of fresh water. With advanced technology, we can find ways to use ice on mountains.

It is generally beleived that Fresh Water will never run out. We can take water from brooks, rivers, wells, rainwater. Even From seas, according to this opinion, human can use water freely. However , in Fact , The shortage of Fresh water has become a more and more serious problem. One cause of this is increasingly population; another cause is more and more water used in industry; moreover, more and more Fresh water has been polluted by industry and agricature . So that , The Fresh water becomes less and less can be use to drinking, washing;. . . . and so on. It prevents people's daily life and production. as is said above, Fresh water is essential for us, therefore, Firstly it is urgent for the authorities related to bring the pollution under control; in addation , we should make every people relieze the important of Fresh water; and warn people not to waster it; Finally. We should apply technologe to purfying water taken from the seas or rainwater.

People usually think that we have plenty of fresh water and can't use it up forever. People can get it from rivers, wells. And if it rains, people can obtain the fresh water too. So many people don't know that they should save up the fresh water. Actually, the fresh water is very shortage. In recent years, the pollution is very serious. Some rivers can't provide fresh water. But the population of the world increased quickly. People need more and more fresh water. The shortag of fresh water is a serious proble to be solved. It is well know that, where there is water, there is life. Now, the fresh water becomes less and less. How we should do? At first, we should control the population to discrease the need of fresh water. Then, we must save up the quantity of using fresh water. At last, we must, make the polluted rivers and wells clear again. And we will have plenty of fresh water again.

We may often think that there is abuntent of fresh water on the earth and there is no possible we run out of fresh water. For instance, when it rains we have plenty of fresh water, and we can get fresh water from river or the ice on mountain . In fact, the resource of fresh water is global short. The popution of the earth creases very quickly, which means the need of fresh water increases, and the development of industry also need more fresh water. At the same time the development of industry brings out polution which makes the fresh water poluted . All the above tells us fresh water is global short more and more . How should we do with the global shortage of fresh water? Frist , we should find out the reason we are short of fresh water. Secondly we should use fresh water effectively. Also we should research new source of fresh water.

Most people think that fresh water in our planet is abundant and can't be used out . Almost everywhere we can see the water which come from the rain, the rivers, the lakes and the wells as well. So many people haven't realise the importance of protect the resource of water and waste or pollute water casually. While , in fact, the fresh water in the earth is very short. With the increase of the population, the water seems short to go round among the world. Besides, the fast improved industries also cause the shortage of fresh water. More seriously, the consequence of the industry improvement is the pollution of water. So it's no wonder that many scientists appeal that we should protect the global water resource early. As the member of the Big Family, we must do our bests to protect the water resource. That is, we must try not to pollute the water and use the water properly. In addition to , we should call on the others to do so. We believe we can make the earth to be a heaven as long as each of us can protect the water!

Many people take it for grant that fresh water will never be out of use . It often rains; the river is flowing every day; the well is always full of water. And we can get it whenever we want. In fact, fresh water is becoming very shortage. With more population and developing of industray , need of water increases very quickly. At the same time, more and more rivers are polluted. So fresh water that we can get becomes less and less. Every year there are a large number of areas turn into desert because of being in short of water. How can we do to change it ? We should try our best to save every drop of water. The factories should avoid polluting the river . The trees should be planted to keep the soil and water from flowing. In a word, please save every drop of water in order to protect our beautiful earth.

Fresh water is one of most important things for our lives, which is well know for us. But most of us aren't aware of making good use of it. They think there are lots of water in the lakes, rivers and wells, and it often rains too, the fresh water don't run out. But what they think is quite wrong. From some books, we know that the total of fresh water of the earth don't increase for ever, only it can recycle , quicker if we make good use of it. In nowdays , more and more men are born, industries develop much quicker , which are all need lots of fresh water. At the same time, being not to be pretect , more and more fresh water are poluted , and the fresh water we can use now are much less than several years ago. Lack of the fresh water has been a most curious problem for many cities, even many courties . This problem should be delt with at once. We can't have a good life if the situation goes on. We should make good use of every drop of fresh water and never polute it, which is an important duety for every one. Only when we do good to the fresh water, even the nature, they can do good to ourselives and we can have a better life with more fresh water, or the last drop of water on the earth we can find maybe is the tear of ourselves!

People think that we have lots of fresh water to be used . We sure that it rains in every year. River water is running in river Even it hasn't rained for a long time. We believe that it will be sure to rain. Certainly, Fresh water will never be used up. However, Fresh water is very absent in some countries. Including our country. Population of our contry is increasing. More and more people use fresh water, Yet fresh water doesn't add up . On the contrary, More and more factories make use of fresh water to make others goods. At the same time, plenty of water is polluted. Less and less water can be used. We must protect fresh water in order to survive in the earth. We should be warned of making good use of fresh water. Industrial water should be cleaned before sending into rivers. So we will live in a beautiful world.

People alway think that there have a lot of fresh water on the earth, we can get fresh water from river well rain etc. so people ofter waste it, we can see this every where. In fact, in nowdays , fresh waster is very scare, because the number of human on the earth have become larger and larger, and with the increase of industry, fresh water have become less and less, and with the increase of industry, a lot of fresh water had been polluted. In some newspaper recently , we can see a report: In BangBn city , because of the pollution a lot of fresh water couldn't drink so people had to find out clear fresh water to drink. Read this report what we will think about ? What should we do to change this condition? First, we should not waste a drop of fresh water. If everyone on the earth waste a drop of fresh water we will lost the water that can full of the long river. Second, we should not pollute the fresh water. I think, If we can do this the water will become clear and good for drinking. It's good for you for her and for every one of us!

People always think that it is impossible that global shortage of fresh water. They think that we can use fresh water from river , rain and under the ground, which, is shortlessness . But in fact, nowaday , we really short of fresh water. With the development of the population, industry and even the pollution, it makes us have to develop more to support . Factories always let out much poisonus which polluted the riveres and the lakes. That make us difficult to clean the water for people use. So the recently problem is how to solve the water problem. Because the water soarce on earth is so limited, the first we must make use of it, we should not waste it, the second we should do is that we must develop our technique to use the water we couldn't use before, just as polluted water and iceburg in the antlantic oceaon . If we did so I think we would have past the period of "shortage water".

Because the population of the whole world increase so fast, so we require much more fresh water than ever. Secondly, with the industry developed , more and more fresh water was required, and more and more fresh watch was poluted . So our fresh water resources are poor. How should we do then? In my opinion, we should make use of every drop of water above all . Secondly, we should try our best to avoid poluting the fresh water. I think we can deal with the shortage of fresh water.

But those people are wrong. In nowadays fresh water is in shortage all over the world. Especially, in large cities. There are many many people in large cities and the number of the population is still increasing. With the increasing population, more and more fresh water is used in everyday life. The same thing happens in industry. Some new factories are built up at the high speed with the development of scientific technology. As a result, the more fresh water is used, the more pollution is made. Then the side effects of the water pollution made fresh water hard to get. What shall we do to deal with the serious problem? In my opinions , everyone should attach importance to it . We should not waste the precious, fresh water. Factories can take steps to make polluted water refreshed and used . Let's take actions from now on to protect our fresh water resource for the future.

In our lives, the need of fresh water is very large, our lives need fresh wate , industry needs fresh water, and many other fields also need water. But fresh water is limited, and there also lies the pollution of fresh water, so those make fresh water to be much shorter. The increase of the population and more water use in industry make the need about fresh water increase. What has been mentioned all request us to make a resolution on how to deal with the shortage of fresh water. In order to solve the problame about the shortage of fresh water, we must do as this. First of all, we must be quite aware of the limition of fresh water. Above that, we must be limited to use fresh water. Further more , we must decrease the pollulation of fresh water. Finally, we must find some new fresh water resource. Where there is no water, there is also no life. We must pay more attention to the shortage of fresh water.

First, with the increasing of population, more and more water is needed in daily use. Second, with the development of industry, the need of water is increasing. In addition, the serious pollution make much water useless. Fortunately, many people are aware of the problem and steps have been taken in many countries.

People always take it for granted that fresh water is much enough to use up. To their mind, we can get it from rain, river and well etc. As a matter of fact, human being is very short of fresh water. With the development of industry, The water used by industry becomes more and more. Because of the population increasing , eating-water needs much more than before. When our earth is crowded with human being , pollutions such as air pollution, noise pollution, especially water pollution all arise. From all above we metioned , we can conclude that we have not much fresh water to use. This is a universal problem, and we must take notice of it. What shall we do when we face up to it? Most important of all, I think, is to make people aware of this serious problem, let them solve it themselves. So long as we deal with it together, I believe we can avoid crisis. We should obey the family plan, and decrease the population. Not only do it, but also we should reduce the pollution. To be brief, It ought to be solved by people all over the world.

People always think that the source of fresh water is abundant and it will never be used up. Because there is more than 70 percent of surface covered with water on the earth, and we can make use of fresh water in the form of rain, river, well and so on.  But in fact the tolal source of water in the world is limited and the fresh water is even more limitful . These years, because of the increasing population, water pollution and requiring more water used in industry, we need more and more fresh water. But the actual amount of fresh water is far from meeting to our needs. In our lives, there already have been a crisis of fresh water. Being a member of mankind, we should not hesitate for a moment to do our best to make great use of fresh water. First, we ought to do things from ourselves, such as use fresh water efficiently. Second, we should correct others' actions of wasting water. We also have responsibility to make more people know the importance of fresh water.

More and more fresh water is polluted by many factories. many factories give off poisonous gas which pollutes air, so rain water also can't be used by us. With the development of industry the factories also need much fresh water. all those make fresh water become shortage . How can we solute this problem that we are short of fresh water? We should take steps to prevent fresh water from being polluted. Factories are not allowed to give off poisenous gas. We can get fresh water from slat water because the water in the sea will never be used up. If you do like what we say. I think we'll never worry about shortage of fresh water.

People always take it for granted that fresh water will never be in shortage. For we can find it in the river , from the well . Acturally , fresh water is always in shortage. With the development of industry, many factories have built up. They all consume water. What's more, they might give out chemical dusty with water. This brings about water pollution and cuts down quantity of fresh water. And the world population is growing rapidly now.  Be faced with this urgen situation, we should do something to help ourselves.

People take it for granted that water resources will never be used up. There are many water sources where we can fetch water, such as rain, rivers and wells and so on. In fact, we are very short of water. To begin with, because of the rapidly increase of population, more and more water is wanted for people to use in daily . In addition, with the development of industry, a large number of factories call for more and more water than ever. Finally, water pollution is a very serious problem, which is caused by various wastes flowing into water. What can we do to solve the problem? On the one hand, we must take actions to cut down the excessive demands for water by controlling the overpopulation. On the other hand, we must effectively prevent the water from being polluted and wasted. For example, we can put more laws about the protection of water into effect. What is more, it is high time that we realized the importance and serious shortage of water.

People think that fresh water is never used up. There are many resources of fresh water, such as raining water, water in the river , water in the well . . . Of course, there is something wrong with what is in follows above. Actually fresh water very lacks in our world. With the development of economy, population is also increasing, even faster than supplies of fresh water and any other sources. In the same way, fresh water used in industry adds up too. On the contrary , more and more pollutats are produced, which seriously polluted the fresh water. In addition, lots of people waste fresh water now and then. Therefore, shortage of fresh water has become a serious problem today. Since we have been aware of it, measures should be taken in solving this problem. Some experts think that we should purity polluted water, and go on using them. On the other hand, everyone should protect fresh water from being polluted, and value any drops of fresh water. In a word, we don't waste our precious fresh water!

People think that fresh water can get for ever. There are many fresh water resoures in Global , such as the rain water, the river water and the well water, we can get it in every where. But actually. It is very shortage of the fresh water. With the sociaty and economic developping at present, It become more serious. It is caused mainly by the pollution rising , the industrial water rising and the pollution. The more population must be supply with the more water for drinking, washing, and so on. Like wisely , the more industry develops, the more water need . What is more, the pollution waste a lot of the water resources. For the future we should use our fresh water resonablely . We should controll the population to incease and save the industrial water. It is most important to prevent our Global from the pollution. It is our responsabity to save the fresh water in daily life.

Why? Because a lot of fresh water has been polluted. The polluted water can't be used by people. And the water which is used in the industry gets more and more . And the population increase . So the water is used for people's drinking is not enough. To global shortage of fresh water, how we can do? First, we should prevent the fresh water from polluting . Then, we should control the increasing of population. Every one can't waste a drop of water. Do you hear of a sentence by radio?

So many people think that water is not limited. Rains can give us a lot of water. We can also get water from the well under the field. But what the true condition is ? We can get a lot of messages of shortage of Fresh water from radio, TV etc. Our country has many people but less of Fresh water. Water in oceans are not fresh water, so we coundn't use it without being cleaned. In the world the population is developing very quickly. Industry also need lots of water and the anomt of using water is increasing. Many lakes and rivers are pulluted , so we can't use the water in these lakes or rivers. Even some lake and river is dry. So we must find a way to make full use of water. It is important that we do not waste water. We must develop our science to use water in oceans.

What we have? If there is a question as this. I think many people will say, "water!" Yeah, people often think the water is very, very much . If just a glance. It's right. Rain gives us the fresh water and rives hid them. But in fact, the fresh water is very limit . Why I said as this? First there are 5,000 millions people on this star, of cause there are many other animals and many plants. They all need water. The water we need in a day can become a large lake. Second produce , food-making , machine-working and so on also need a lot of fresh water. The water that has been used will be bad and can't use again. The third is polution . By the adding of machine, car, a great deal of water was poluted . So, we must know, Fresh water is limit . And we also should do some work for our fresh water. For our student we should not waste the fresh water in every day and use them more carefully.

There is always lots of rains, rivers, wells . . . and it seems water is the first thing we shall never be lack of. This kind of opinion is hold by most people. When they are using water, they never have the idea that they should be care of the "inexhaustable " blood of nature. But in fact, take the following factors into account, the explosion of population, the rapid development of industry. And its great demand of water, and the worse pullution , you'll see that to some extent. Our water supply is getting more and more troublesome to face . Perhaps, the days we must pay dearly to get water is coming. And then we shall regret the careless use of water we are doing now. No doute , we must control our eccessive use of water. Every one must hold the idea "water is blood, and blood is life". What's more, we can try to find some new sources of water, from the sea or the icebergs perhaps. Scientists are doing these kinds of experements . If we all really know the importance of water, maybe we'll have another future, a better one.

People always believe that fresh water has too much to use up. So they don't worry about it. Fresh water include rain water, river water and well water, Although people get water from a kind of approach, in fact, fresh water is global shortage. Why do you say that? Some people will request . There are several reasons. One cause is that the population is increasing, they need a great deal of water. The other cause is that with industry developing, it is necessary to need lots of water. So they use some water to produce. At the meantime, fresh water is polluted. For instance, factory send out waster water including chemical material. How can we do? At first , it is important for us to prevent our fresh water from pollution. And then we can plant many trees near the river to keep our water from losing. Let's take a part in the action!

Man cann't live without air and water. Water is as important as air. In the past, people thought that fresh water would never be used out . There is plenty of water of rain, of rivers, of hells and so on. Nowdays , the whole earth is shortage of fresh water. Fresh water is shortage because of some reasons. First, with the increasing of population, human being need more and more fresh water for everyday lives. Second, the rapid development of industy need more water and the factories often poluted the water nearly . Today, polution is a serious problem to every country. It wasted a lot of clear fresh water. In order to profect the source of fresh water, on one hand, we should forbid the polution of water. Such as some big chemical factories. On the other hand, we should use water economicaly . Such as use the water many times through circle in some factories. I think we will not shortage of fresh water for a long time if everyone does this .

Some people take it for granted that fresh water will not be used up. Since there are rain water, river water, well water and so on. Hence, they never realize the importance of water. If there is no water, there will be no life. Of course, this is not the case. On one hand, the population is increasing rapidly and they requires enough fresh water to survive. On other hand, water that industry needs is increasing too. In addition, we are faced the even more serious problem---- water pollution. The river has been becoming dirty and the water smells terrible. It is reported that many parts in the world are shortage of water. Fortunately, concerned people are realizing the problem. Governments have estambished laws to control water pollution. However there is a long way we will go before we can enjoy plenty of clear and harmless fresh water.

People think fresh water is suficient . We can get it from the rain, river, well and so on. But in fact, it is in global stortage . Both the increase of population and the development of the industry lead to the shortage of fresh water. And the polution makes the fresh water dirty. Some can not be used. All this tell us the problem is serious. What should we do? First, I think we must do it from oneself. Don't waste water in our daliy life. Second, the gevonerment should pay attantion to the industrial polution , and take action on it. I think if all of us care for the problem, we can make our lives better.

So it is very likely that people think that water couldn't be use out . In fact, fresh water is very shortage. With the increase of the population in the world and the increase in industrial water, more and more water are needed. Morover , water pollution in many industrial cities becomes serious. So, what should we do about it. First of all, we should make good use of fresh water and not waste it any longer. Secondly, we should call on people not to waste water, and protect the water resources. Finally, we can take some methods to produce fresh water. Such as using the ice water, and sea water. In a word, as long as we put our heads together. We can solve the problem.

People always think that fresh water can't use out . They can tell you that it can be from rain, river, well and so on. So you can use fresh water as you want. In fact fresh water are very shortage. Because the population increase very quickly, and the water for factory increase too. This makes the fresh water very shortage . But the important reason for shortage of fresh water is water polution . It makes the water not to be drinked . Above this , what can we do for shortage of fresh water? The first, we should use fresh water little. If we do not use fresh water, we must shut it up. The second, we should protect the source of fresh water, discrease water polution .

People always think that fresh water is endless . There are some sources such as rain, river water and well water. These sources seem to endless, so people confirm their belief that fresh water is endless. In fact, the problem of shortage of fresh water is more serious. With the development of society, the population is increased very quickly. Industrial water is required more and more. Moreover, there is some water is being polluted. How can we do nowaday ? If we want to suvive on the earth, we would not waste water. We should refine fresh water from sea water with technology. In addition, we should take advantage of the used water and change it into fresh water. We should prevent our fresh water from reducing.

People always think that fresh water will not be used up. Rain brings us fresh water. We can obtain fresh water from rivers. And water from wills is also fresh water. In fact fresh water is very limited. With the increase of population, the average amount of fresh water for each person will decrease. Industry uses more and more fresh water, and at the same time, more and more fresh water is polluted. How can we do with the lack of fresh water? We should use fresh water efficently , and not waste any fresh water. It is a also our responsibility to call up other people to make good use of fresh water.

People think that fresh water will never be run out. There are many resources of water. For example, rain water , water in the rivers and wells are enough to be used. In fact, it is very short of fresh water. Now the population is inceaseing . By estimated , the number of people will above 500,000 million by the end of this centery . On the other hand, the factories are increasing too. They used much water. Above all, they cause to water pollution. All of these make fresh water decreased. What can we do about these? In the first place, we must economize fresh water. In the second place, we must improve the technology and reduce the pollution. Finally, it is necessary to control the population.

Some people think that fresh water will not be run out. There is so much fresh water on the earth and we can get it from the rain, the river, the well . How could it be used up? But in fact, we are very short of fresh water. Every year, the population increases a lot. And with the development of industry, more and more fresh water is used. In addition, people cause a lot of pollutions , which demage the source of fresh water. All of the facts make fresh water less and less. So we must pay more attention to the problem. We should save fresh water by all means, such as planting , reducing pollution. If we try our best to save water, it will become richer again.

People always think that there are a great amount of fresh water in our earth and fresh water can be get from many resources, such as rain water, river water, or water in our wells, etc. In fact, we are facing the shortage of fresh water. There are a large number of population in the world. And the average level of fresh water is rather little. Now fresh water that can be made use of is decreasing. One reason for it is the increasing of population. Another is the increasing of fresh water for industry. Besides, most important of all is the pollution of the industry. Facing this stuation , we should try to protect the rare fresh water. First, we should call on each country to controe the population. Second, we should decrease industry pollution and controe the water for industry. In order to not waste fresh water, we should manage to make full use of it.

In past few years even in nowadays. Some people believe that fresh water will never be used up. They believe so because they think there are large water in our earth. Such as in rivers and wells. But as a matter of fact, this is, of cause , not the case. With the development of economy. Shortage of fresh water has become a secrious social problem, because the increase of population and industies need more and more water. in addition, a large ammout of water has being polluted. Those cause the shortage of water . It's no exaggeration to say that man will kill themselves without taking measure to save water. But how to. In my opinion, First of all, we shall make good use of water. After that, we shall protect water from polluting . Finally, we shall make more people know the importance of water and the sacriosity of shortage of water.

Most of people think that the fresh water is always enough to be used. For the thousands of years, people take it from rain, rivers and others. Today, they are also doing it . It makes them a mistake impression that they can take it freely. In fact, the fresh water is very short now. With the development of all world , the situation is changed. The number of population is great large, everyone needs fresh water! More and more factories are built, everyone needs water! On the other hand, the water is poluted . The limited fresh water is getting shorter and shorter. What should we do? The first, we shall face the problem. The second, everyone should not waste the water and do something to clear the water. Then our lives will be better.

Water is essential for plant, animal and our human being . Where there is water, there is life. Fresh water is a little part of all kinds of water. People may think that fresh water is endless becase it can be gain from the rain, the rivers, the wells and so forth. But in fact, we are facing the shortage of fresh water. With the increasment of population and with the development of the industry and the agriculture, the need for fresh water is increasing rapidly. At the same time, a lot of water, including fresh water, has been polluted. So the problem of shortage of fresh water is seriouser than before. In order to solve this problem, everybody should do something for our planet. Above of all, we should make good use of every drop of water rather than waste it. Second, we should search new water resourse . Only doing so can we solve the problem properly.

A lot of people think that fresh water is enough to use. That is say, we don't worry about shortage of fresh water. Why do the people think of it? Because we can find plenty of fresh water beside us. The rain falling give us a lot of fresh water and we can apply for water from rivers and the water under the earth. It is the reason that people think the fresh water is enough to use. In fact, fresh water is faced a serious probrem of shortage. With the incease population, we require a much more fresh water than before. Further more , now a lot of factoris are builted , the application of water for industry increase . Then a lot of fresh water is pollused . As a result of all , we can seen obviously the fresh water is short. How can we do with the problem of shortage of fresh water. I think we first shall not waste the fresh water. It is can save a lot of fresh water. The second, we take the object of pollusion of water, and do it through the pemittion of the law. All in all, we shall clearly face the problem of the shortage of fresh water, and clear up with what doing our best.

People think fresh water is beyond the limit that we need. Why? The world is full of fresh water: rain water, river water, etc. and the water can get the ground again after the water-cycle . But in fact, it's not the case. The shortage of fresh water is a serice problem. With the development of morden factories and the increase of the population, much fresh water is run out, and most seriouse of all, we poluted the surroundings. Since we have faced the cricis of fresh water, we should do what we can to release the problem. First, we should aware of the increase of population and make rules to prevent its increasing . Second, we must make good use of fresh water. Last , we should not polut the water, and turn the poluted water into fresh water.

We may take it for granted that fresh water is much more in supply than in demand. Because the resources of fresh water are adequate. We can get fresh water from rain, river, well and so on. In fact, we are faced with the problem of global shortage of fresh water. Growing of population, increasing in industrial water and water pollution all result in the shortage of fresh water. Nowadays, shortage of fresh water has been a serious problem which affected our daily life and development of industry, in a sense . As is well-known to us, fresh water is essential to our life. What can we do to slove the problem? Above all, we should save water. Then we should take steps to prevent fresh water from being polluted.

We can get fresh water from rivers and wells. Rain water in also fresh water. So some people think it is impossible for us to use up all fresh water. But , in fact, fresh water is very scarce. With the increasing of population, people use more and more fresh water every day. In the same time, with the development of industry, a lot of new factories have been built up. Consequently, the use of fresh water has increased. More over , some fresh water has been polluted. What can we do now? First, we should save the fresh water. Second, we ought to prevent fresh water from being polluted.

In the old days, peoples always took it for granted that the water would not be used up because the water was so easy to see, such as raining river, sea and so on each could bring water. In fact, the fresh water is very short now because of the improving population, and the demands of industrial use is rising every years , puticultly that the pollution of the fresh water, the shortage of fresh water affects much our life. How can we? We should face up this question and adopt us to overcame it. First, we should control the improvement of population. Second, we should call on all citizens using the water suitable . Third, we should try to avoid the fresh water from being polluted.

Most people consider that Fresh water is so adequate that it may not be used over . The nature provide us a lot of fresh water source, such as rain. There are a great deal of rivers and the under-earth-water in the nature. However, the fact there are shortage of Fresh water in the human being's living room. Firstly, with developing ariticlvture , the ariticale water increase. It lead to reduce the fresh water for people. Secondly, the popullation are greatly increased, it cause the average-water level fall down. Thirdly, the pollution change great fresh water into wasted water. Whereas fresh water is limited by the rain . Every every the fresh water's level may not added. But, what do we do? At first we must have our best to save a drop of fresh water. Then we must control the pollution and reduce the pollution. It is important for us to limit the critical water. That above all , we can have a good living for ever.

It is well known that fresh water is important to our lives. We can not imange the world would be without water. Most people recognize the importance of water, but many people don't know the shortage of water problem, they take it for granted that fresh water is enough to what people need. They think that we can get fresh water from raining , river and under soil and so on. In fact, we are in great need of fresh water, with the development of the socity . Firstly the population is increasing, industry is required more water. Secondly, we don't make enough way to protect water, plenty of fresh water has been polluted. Fortunately, more and more people realize the global shortage of fresh water. We must do something about protecting fresh water. We should hold up the increasing population as possibly as we can. In a word, protecting fresh wate is protect ourselves.

For we live in a big planet, we always think it to be a truth that the fresh water can be use without limits since we have a lot of fresh water from the rain, rivers and walls as well. But , in fact, it's not the case The fresh water is very shortage all over the world. With the raise of population, the raise of industry-use water, we need more fresh water. Also, polution made the poor water more shortage . Although we have plenty of fresh water, compare with the big consume , the fresh water is relatively shortage . Nowadays, the shortage of fresh water become a big problem in the world. Without the fresh water, mankind can out survive. To solve the problem, we must save the fresh water and reduce the polution . Now scientists are studying a way to gain fresh water from the sea. If it comes true, the problem of the fresh water will be solved.

People take it for granted that fresh water will never be used up. Because fresh water can be found all over the world. For example, it can be found in raining , in a river, in a lake, in a well. All kinds of water we can see around us make us misunderstand , fresh water is unlimited. In fact, fresh water is very current to us. With the increasing of population, more and more people are in need of fresh water. With the development of industrial , more and more factories are increasing their needs of fresh water. Though the need of fresh water is rising, much fresh water is polluted, when factories produce their product, they put poisinous water into the river or the lake , which make fresh water polluted and then reduce it. Under the hard condition, what can we do? I think it is important to us all. So everyone should use fresh water as little as he (she) can. Every factory should clean the polluted water before it was put into river or lake . And the politicians should take measures to prevent fresh water from being polluted, being wasted. They also should take efficient step to control the increasing of population.

People all think that fresh water such as rain water, river water can be used unlimited . But I don't think so. In fact, fresh water is global shortage. We can see in the past few years that the population is increased . We all drink fresh water. We can't live without fresh water. With the development of industry, factory used more and more water, and water is serious polluted. This poison water can't be used. And fresh water now is so limit . How can we do? First we should not waste fresh water. We must reused the polluted fresh water in other way, and we turn polluted water into fresh water. we must make it to be known in the society.

People always think that fresh water is out of shortage. For example, we can use rain water, stream water, well water, and so on. We can also use water under the ground for our need . In fact, the water shortage has become a big problem in our lifes . With the development of argriculture and industry, water is used enormous . The increasing population need more water. And more and more water is being polluted. But how can we do for it. First, we must make full use of fresh water. Second, we should prevent fresh water from pollution. At last , we should pourify the waste water and reuse it.

People always think that there is enough fresh water for them. We often can get water from rainning , river , so many people may never worry about the shortage of the fresh water, and they often waste a lot of water in lifetime. In fact, shortage of the fresh water is a serious problem now. Today, population increases quickly, more people existence more fresh water to be need . And industry also need enormous fresh water. Many factories can't work without water. Now more factories are found , and most of them can give off poisonoused gas, water. This poisonoused gas and water would make more fresh water be poisonoused . So a lot of fresh water is wasted, and they can not be used straightly again. How should we deal with the problem. First, a very important question is how to make people believe that fresh water is limitation . When people realize this, they can save fresh water at home, at school, in factory and everywhere. The second, we should make many factory realize that they are also doing wrong thing . They should make gas and water which are give off from them as clean as before they are used. To save the fresh water, many problems should be solved immedately .

It is hard to imagine that what life would like without water. Water is vital to everything on earth-animals, plants and human being . People always think that there is enough water to use by human being . However, the problem of global shortage of fresh water is more visiable and serious. The expandation of population and the development of industry and agriculture need much more water. On the other hand, water pollution frequently takes place in some areas. And some people still waste water when they are washing and bathing. Face up to the shortage of fresh water, what should we do? I think, the first most of all, don't waste water any longer and save water to make good use of it. Second, we can lay down some regulations to prevent people from pollouting it and we try to our best to purify and recircle sea water and rain water. Lastly, we must improve the thought of saving water and behave ourselves by act .

Fresh water can be found everywhere, in rivers, in wells, in lakes and so on. Many people think that there are so much fresh water that we can never use them up. But this is not the case. In fact, people are in short of fresh water. Fresh water is limited. World population is increasing rapidly. In order to meet the need of all the people's every life, a large quality of fresh water is used. The need of industrial fresh water is also increasing. On the other hand, with the development of morden industry, more and more water are polluted. You can see polluted water in rivers nere factories or in the coutryside . The fresh water is becoming less and less. We are facing a serious problem of the shortage of fresh water. But how shall we do with this problem? I think the following three points are important: First, we must be fully aware of that fresh water is limited and we are facing a serious problem. Second, Fresh water must be preserved. We should prevent current fresh water from being polluted. We should also do our best to make the polluted water clean. Third, we must make good use of fresh water.

Our earth is mainly covered by water. It rains sometimes. And we have other water, such as river water. So some people think that fresh water will never be rare. But, do you know the fresh water we have becomes shortager and shortager ? In fact, now, because of the increasing population, pollution and other facts, the fresh water has not enough for us to use. For example, in summer, in our apartment, we can not use fresh water in the noon. And sometimes, in our lab, we can not work because we have no fresh water. This has held back our life and work. How can we do? The first, we must know that fresh water is very important to us. The second, we should use fresh water in an order . The final , we should develop more and more fresh water.

Fresh water is the most important thing in our life. We can't live without fresh water. Many people think that fresh water can't be used up. Because rain, river provides us a lot fresh water. But in fact, the shortage of fresh water is very serious. As the developing of society, the population is increasing, the speed of industrial development is faster than ever. That needs a lot fresh water. And today, the pollution of fresh water is a big problem too. So, we can see how serious the shortage of fresh water is! Then, what can we do? First, we can't waste even a drop of fresh water. Second, we must control the population of our earth, and control the pollution of fresh water. Third, we must let more and more people know how serious the situation is. Things must be done to protect the fresh water. Let us do it now.

Many people believe that the fresh water couldn't be used up. Because they know that there is a lot of water in the world. Rivers and lakes are distributed all over our globe. And there is plenty of rain in the rain seasons. In addition, farmers dig wells in their houses and fields using the underground water. But as a matter of fact, the fresh water is limited. As you know, the world population is increasing fast. And with the development of industry, the water for this purpose is very much. Most of all, the water pollution is dangerious . So, what much fresh water can one person get from the nature? In order to resolve this coming water crisis, man should take steps immediately. First, man must control the world population through the family plan . Second, man must deal with the pollution to purify the polluted water. Last , man could use the sea water by developing the scientific devices. In short, man could not survive without the fresh water.

Many people think the fresh water in the world is so abundant that it can't be run out. We can take fresh water from the rain, the river and so on, so the global shortage of fresh water is impossible. In fact, at present, the problem of global shortage of fresh water become heavier and heavier . With the increasing of the population, the increasing of the demand for the water for industry, many people realized our world is short of fresh water. The fresh water which we had today can't satisfied all the demand of our society, and at the same time, the problem of water polution is very seciously , and this destroyed the quality of the fresh water. Today, global shortage of fresh water already become a problem that must be solved as quickly as possible. To solve the problem, first, we must do our best to make good use of every drip of the fresh water. Second, we must control the increasing of the population. After doing that we can reduce the demand for fresh water. We must solve the problem of water population and we can discover the new resource of fresh water with our science knowledge. Maybe, in future we can get the fresh water from the sea and at that time the fresh water can be really abundant.

Most people of us think we have much fresh water, for example, there are rainwater, riverwater in our global . So most people think the fresh water is not short for ever, and we can use it inlimited . In fact, our fresh water is very short. There are many reasons why our fresh water will be leaser and leaser . First, there are more and more people in our global . Second, with the industrol developing, much fresh water will be used. Third, the poulaction of water is more serious. Then in order to avoied having no water to drink, what should we do? In my opinion, first, we must use water economically, we must make good use of the fresh water. We don't waste the fresh water. Second, we should find the new fresh water, for example ice water. In short, we must make full use of our fresh water in our global .

Some people think that the fresh water won't go to the end . We can get the fresh water from rain, rivers and lakes and so on, which will not end , so we can use the enough fresh water forever. In fact, there is in short of the fresh water on the earth. Because the populations of the world increase rapidly, we need more and more fresh water. With the development of the industries, more and more fresh water is required. And we polute a amount of fresh water. The fresh water in the world is limited. A lot of cities have been in short of the fresh water. And more and more cities and countries are coming to it . How can we do? Firstly, we must control the populations and the development of the industries in order to save the fresh water. Secondly, we should try our best to use less water all time. Thirdly, we should try to find. a new way to get the fresh water. For example, can study how to get the fresh water from the occeans .

Many people take it granted that fresh water can't run out. There are many kinds of water, such as rain, river, well and so on, so they think we needn't to save fresh water. In fact, we are short of fresh water. Here is why: For one thing, the population is increasing rapidly, more and more people need fresh water; For another, with the development of advanced technology, many new factories are being founded, they also need water; Last but not least, pollution has become a serious problem of social development , many kinds of fresh water have been polluted and people can not use them. So we can safely draw the conclusion that we must save fresh water. Fresh water is the basis of lives, whenever we should remember to save fresh water.

The fresh water is the thing we must need in our lift . Many people think that the fresh water is enough no matter how we use. There are rain-water , river-water and so on. But in fact, it is very short in fresh water. In these years, the population was increase very fast, human needed more water to drink, wash clouthes and something elths . At the same time, industry's development made we need more water. And it made the fresh water reduce by polution . Now we have no choose , we must control the polution immediately. And we can't waste a drop of water. If everyone can do these, we will have enough water.

When we talk about the grobal shortage of fresh water, some people may be surprised; We have lots of fresh water, the water in river , the water in well and rain-water are all fresh water, how can we use it up ? In fact, fresh water is in global shortage. You see, with the increase of population, we need more water with the development of industry, we also need more . Furthermore unforturntaly , some fresh water which can be used now turns useless, for it is poluted . So, how can we avoid the shortage? So, we should do a lot to deal with it, but how? I think, firstly, we should make full use of fresh water and don't waste a drop of water; Second, we should not make water poluted again, we should do our best to make it useful. Third, we can reuse the used water, which may help us to escape from the global shortage of water. In one word, we should realize the shortage of fresh water, and we should also save the water instead of wasting a drop! Let's do for it!

Water is considered to be next to oxgen in importance. Not only does man drink it to survive, but uses it to grow crops and run factories, to clean himself and his house. Man can't live without water. Many people believe that fresh water is very rich, we can get water from river, lake , rain and so on. On other hand, more than 3/4 surface of earth is covered with sea. In fact, with the rapid progress of population and polution , we have faced to the global shortage of fresh water. One way to deal with this serious problem is to use the water in the sea. But, that isn't useful because of it's high mineral content, so we have to spend a lot of money to make it be useful. Another way is to use the fresh water for a second time, but it is too expensive for us. Now, more and more people realize the global shortage of fresh water and try their best to find a good way to solve it.

People always think that fresh water is never used up. We can see fresh water everywhere. Such as rain, river and well. In fact, there is a global shortage of fresh water on our planet. The increasing population, developing industries, serious pollution, etc. All above mentioned cause the shortage of fresh water. Because we can not live without fresh water, we must take steps to protect our limited fresh water resource. But what shall we do next? There are two ways, I think, to reach our purpose. First, people must realize that fresh water is very important to us all. Only after this step, people will save the fresh water in their daily life and struggle with those who waste it. Second, we must develop a reasonable industry structure and take control of the population. We think more about fresh water before we build a factory. And we do our best to reduce the birth rate. In short, we must save every drop of water from now on. We must keep the following words in our minds: no water, no man.

We live in this world because there are water, atmosphere. Atmosphere is around us and water blows through our land. To living , we must drink lot of water everyday. But not all water could be droken . The sea water can not be droken , what we can drink is only the fresh water. We can take fresh water from the rainning , river, under the ground and so on, so many pirsons think the fresh water will never be worn out. But it is not the truth. In fact, the fresh water is very short. With the development of human civilization, rate of birth incream and rate of death discream , so more and more people come to this world, they need drinking water. Our industry is developing day by day. That is to say, it needs more and more fresh water and more and more fresh water will be polluted, so the problem of shortage of fresh water is very serious. Facing such fact, how should we do? I think we should save fresh water from everyday's and everyone's water using , don't waste even a drop of water. Remember this: Fresh water is the source of living .

People always think there is such a great number of fresh water that we can get constantly and the fresh water will not be used up for ever. They often say, "You see, we can get fresh water from rain, river , and get it in wells. However, the fresh water is of global shortage in fact. The reasons of the shortage is very apparent. In one hand, the constantly increasement of population make the limite water source short contrastly , and in the other hand, with the development of industry, more water is to be used and to be polluted seriously . The streams, the rivers are polluted so badly that they send out odd smell. What should we do when we face up those problems. How should we save the fresh water which is global shortage. First, we should make most of people realize the fact of water shortage and appeal every one to protect the fresh water. Second we can also make use of the water geted from sea.

Second, a great deal of fresh water was polluted by people. So we are having a global shortage of fresh water. In order to solve this problem, we should save the fresh water. We should make full use of fresh water. If possible, we should recycle it. We must protect the source of our lives -- fresh water.

People always take for granted that the fresh water will never to the end. It seems that fresh air is seen everywhere, just like rain, branches, rivers, etc. However, it is not the case. Scientist find that we have faced the global shortage of fresh water. The reasons are as fellows . For one thing, water must supply to the more people for the increasing rates of birth. For another, with the development of mordern industry, factorys require the adequent water to apply the contemporary production. As a result, rivers have been polluted, rain water are full of chemical substance. The eirth is in emergency. Therefore, we must do something resolve these problems. First but most important, it is necessary for us to control the area of being polluted present and protect the clean area from being destroyed, next, people should have a idea of use water economically. Let us help ourselves together , the future is beatiful .

In many people's opinion, fresh water can be used as you like because it comes from rain, river, well and so on and will not be run up . They regard it as a free gift or a goods only cost several cent per m3. In fact, they havn't noticed the limitation of fresh water. The fresh water on earth can't supply the improving population. And the pollution makes fresh water useless. Can you accept the fact that the yellow river will be a season-river? In brief, fresh water is so useful to us but we waste it in any way. It's time for us to pay more attention to make full use of fresh water.

In fact, these ideas are wrong, human beings are facing the global shortage of fresh water. As we all know, Fresh water comes from rain, river and well , With the development of society, people need more and more fresh water. Furthermore, pollution become more and more serious. So fresh water become less and less. Thus, how to solve the global shortage of fresh water? In my opinion, first, each of us should save water. "Don't waste water any more"! Second, we should deal with the polluted water before flowing into the river so that we can protect our water. If everyone and every factory both follow these advice, the situation will for the better.

Many cities need more fresh water now. Why does this happen? The increase of the population, the increase of the used water of industry, these increase the use of the fresh water. And the polution make much water can't be used. Since the water is needed so important , what shall we do to deal with it? First, we should not waste the fresh water.

But in fact, fresh water is very limited. The population is increasing. And more and more fresh water is polluted. The industry need more fresh water than ever. And people still thinks they have enough fresh water, so the wasting of fresh water is serious. What can we do? We must make it know to everybody that we have very limited water. Everyone must realize this seriously problem. Second, we must discover the resource of fresh water as much as we could. The third, we must take care of the fresh water, it should not be polluted. And the wasting of fresh water must be limited . Only then, we could relieve the shortage of fresh water.

Water is the resource of life. The fresh water includes the rain, the river, the well water, and so on. So some people take it for granted that the fresh water will be never run up . Are they right? No, they are wrong. In fact, we can not use the sea water because it is made up of too salt, and we only can use the fresh water. In some places, the fresh water is scare . There are many factors such as the larger and larger population, the need of the industry, and the water pollution, etc. Some indications show that the fresh water is becoming shorter and shorter. How can we prevent from reducing the fresh water. Something should be done. Do not waste the water for daily life. Find new resources of the fresh water. Stopping from the water pollution. All in all, use every drop of the fresh water carefully and make the earth the global shortage of fresh water.

People always think that the fresh water will not be shortage. We can get it from river rain or other forms . So we didn't think about the shortage of fresh water. In fact, the fresh water is very shortage. Because two third of the earth area is covered into water, but there is a little part of which we can drink-- that is the fresh water. With the development of industry, much fresh water is polluted. And the amount of population is increasing very fast. So the fresh water become very shortage. If you can't realized this, the fresh water won't be satisfied with our need. The people will kill themselves. What can we do to deal with the relation between medical need and development need ? Personaly , I think we should control the pollution and find a way to save the fresh water used in industry and agriculture, in that we can't produce the fresh water in low cost . Then saving fresh water should be insisted for long-term , for the global shortage of fresh water isn't the short-term thing.

Many people take it for granted that the resource of water is inexhausted . They think that some forms of water such as rains, rivers, lakes and so on will exist for ever. Unfortunately, in fact, we are faced with the shortage of fresh water. For one thing, with the progress of industry, the industrial water is increased sharply. For another, the more and more population require more and more fresh water. Furthermore, the all sorts of pollution to fresh water make the problem more serious. . . . What steps shall we take to solve the problem? First, and the most important of all, we should better our biological environment. Plating trees, building tunnel and water-store , these steps will be good for increasing water and bettering biological cycle. Second, we don't waste fresh water any longer, we should be aware of the shortage of fresh water. Final , controling population is also a useful measurment to slove the problem.

In the world, there seems to be much fresh water, such as the water from rain, rivers and wells. So many people take it for granted that fresh water can be used endlessly. But, this thought is wrong. In fact, we are very short of fresh water. This is resulted from the increasing of the quality used in industry, population and pollution. What can we do with this problem? First, we must recognised this problem clearly. Secondly, we should save fresh water in our life. Thirdly, we'd better do our best to prevent fresh water from being polluted further. Finally, we can also control the birth rate in order to decrease the population. Now, we can see that this problem is very serious. Everyone should do his best to solute it.

People take it for granted that fresh water would never be in shortage. Rainfall, rivers and wells provide us with fresh water. We sit in home and whenever we need water, we can always get it. May fresh water be used out ? In fact, fresh water is quite scare . The increasing of population and water using of industry demands more water. But water resource is limited. The never ending demand for water can only result in the global shortage of fresh water. In addition, some people haven't the sense of crisis. They don't understand to protect the limited water resource. Water in many place has been badly polluted. You know, in Great desert, fresh water is more expensive than gold. If people still haven't alert , there will not be only one Great desert. Facing the secious situation, what can we do? Saving the using of water is the most important. Don't always think fresh water won't be in shortage. Don't pollute fresh water again. It's too limited. In addition, improve the technolodge of changing the water of sea into fresh water. Then we can require fresh water from the sea and the water of sea will not be outused .

It is well known that more than 70 percentage of the earth surface are water. Most people think that the sources of the fresh water are so many that we don't exhaust them. For instance, the rains, the rivers, the wells, the ices and so on. But in fact, global shortage of fresh water has become the reality. For example, the increasing of the population, the more need of fresh water with the industry development, the more use of fresh water. But its important reason is that the pollution of fresh water are increased quickly. A lot of water of the river and the well is not used . In some places, the rain water is even not used . So what should we do? First, we should control the population; Second, we should save water; Third, we should make good use of the fresh water in the industry. Finally, we should reduce the pollution of water. In short, I believe that we have enough water in the future.

Some people always think our fresh water can't be used up for over. They often say we have many resources of fresh water. Rain and rivers all are fresh water. We can get it and use it convenietly . But fresh water in our world is very limited. If we use it up, we can't get it again. With the development of population and industrify , more and more fresh water is being used. Seriously , many rivers have been pulloted . Many people are wasting previous fresh water. Our fresh water is becoming much shorter. So we should take steps at once to protect our fresh water. We should solve the problem of the pullotion and save every drop of water at any time. All people should realize fresh water is important to us.

Fresh water is very important for us. Without fresh water we couldn't live. Fresh water includes rain, river , ice and so on. So people take it for granted that fresh water is generous and no limited. In fact, It has been a problem that fresh water is shortage. Why? People get more and more, and fresh water are drunk more and more. Factories use much more fresh water than they used to. Some fresh water are polluted. All these can make the shortage of fresh water. So, how to deal with the problem is very important for us. First, we can control birth. Second, we save up fresh water, and don't waste . Finally, we must assure that fresh water shouldn't be polluted. I think, if we can do well these , we can make better use of fresh water and get rid of the problem.

At present, most people believe that the fresh water can be got for ever. They can say: "We can get the enough fresh water from the rain, the rivers and the wells. " But in fact, fresh water is very rare for our need. Though the water in our world is very rich, the fresh water is only the very small part of it. Today with the increase of the population and the development of industry, we require much more fresh water, but the resource of fresh water becomes smaller and smaller for the pollution. Now in many places in the world people can't get enough fresh water. For example, in our homeland many large cities haven't enough fresh water, so the government have to build the huge projects to take fresh water in other places to these cities. Now we know fresh water is really rare. And how can do? I think that at first we should reduce the waste of water as possible as we can, the second we should keep the resource of fresh water out of pollution, of course, we should look for new fresh water resource . Let's love fresh water, and our future will be more beautiful.

Most people think that fresh water will not run out. The fresh water can come from rain, river, well and so on. But in fact, the fresh water is global shortage. As the population is rising, people use more fresh water for cooking and washing than before. The fresh water of industry used is also rising. And the wasted water from the factories pullate the fresh water. The fresh water is becoming little and little How can we do? First, we should not waste the fresh water. Second, we should tell others not to waste the fresh water. Everyone of us should realize the global shortage of Fresh water. And the factories don't let the pullated water to the river. The family birth should also be controlled.

Without water, people would die. We all know here the "water" means "fresh water". You may think it is impossible for people to use up all fresh water. Because there are so many rivers and wells and rains is also fresh water, how could people use it up? But in fact, the situation of fresh water is very serious. As the population is increasing, and the industry uses more and more fresh water, the average amount of fresh water is little. Forthermore , the pollution is making the fresh water that can be used less . So the situation is more serious. How should we do? I think we should take measures to this question . Firstly, we should control the population. Secondly, we must reduce the amount of what the industry uses and reduce the pollution to the least harm. Thirdly, we must make full use of our fresh water sources. For example, the reuse of the waste water. If we can do these, we must can make our world more better !

People always think that fresh water can not be shortage. It seem that fresh water isn't worn out. Actubly , there are much fresh water as rain, river and so on. Does it must mean that water is enough to use? The answer is not . In fact, fresh water is very shortage. The population increase quickly and the using of water of industry increase more and more. At the same time, people are polluting water quantity . It's reported that there is much fresh water was polluted every year . Fresh water which can be used is decreasing quickly. The human being will face with the terrible problem without water. How can we do? First, we must save fresh water at once and everyone must do so. Second, we shall conserve fresh water source and fright against the action which pollute fresh water. Only through this, we can keep up with enough fresh water, and survive on earth.

People aways think that fresh water can be taken endlessly. They think that fresh water can be taken from rain, river, well and so on. In fact, there is a shortage of fresh water. With the increasing of population, much water are needed for daily live , With the development of industry, much water are consumed every day. There are also all kinds of polution . If we don't take steps to protected our resource of fresh water. I believe, fresh water will become less and less. Someday, we can hardly find a drop of fresh water. What should we do? I think that we must make people realize the importance of fresh water. Without it, we can't live a minter longer . All the people on the earth shouldn't waste a drop of fresh water.

In the past, people used to think that fresh water is plenty for man on the earth. For example it rains every year. And there are plenty in the river, in the lake, and in the well . As a result, we never paid attention to the shortage of fresh water and we wasted a great deal of water which we should not waste. In our lives, shortage of fresh water is actually serious for us. With the development of the industries and agraculation , much fresh water is seriously polluted. Many factories spread these useless water even . It may be harmful to people's health without control . Nowadays, the population is increased quickly. A large of quantily of factories and firms are built they need plenty fresh water. Thus shortage of fresh water takes place. What measures should we take to cope with the serious shortage of fresh water? At presence , many countries pay much attention to it. They have taken some good measures. For example. They had the waste-water delt with. For some fresh water is only used once. They invented a machine that make the water clear and were equipped with a cycle system. On one hand in our lives, we should make full use of the fresh water and not waste a little water. On the other hand, people should have the kind of sense to protect water resources.

No one will have different opinion if someone says that water is the most ordineray thing in the world. It can be found everywhere in our lives. So, some people think fresh water is so much that we will never be in shortage of it. Man can get it from rivers wells and rains even the sea if we do something. They use it freely all the time, and even waste it sometimes. They don't know the danger. But by and by more and more people realize that mankind has to face the problem that we are in shortage of fresh water. Because of the increasing population and the development of industry the need for water has increased greatly and the polution is very serious in the world. So fresh water is being less and less. I think we should reduce the waste and the polution of water above all. We should let everyone know the importance of water then we should use it in suitable way . Let us save water together!

Just as air and food, water is also the fundemental require in our life. Without fresh water we can't live. In many people's eyes fresh water may not be used up. Because there are so many sources. Raining , river and water from the ground as so on. In fact, there is global shortage of fresh water. With the steadly increase of population and increase need of water for indurstry . fresh water become more less . The serious pollution of water is also the majoy reason for the problem. Though there are many sources of water, we can only use little of them. Mankind are facing with the fresh water crisis. How can we do? I think firstly we should not waste water. Make everybody know the shortage of fresh water. Then, we can solut the problem by controlling the increase of population and pollution. On the other hand, scientists and researches try to find other sources or ways to obtain much more fresh water which can be used. We all need clean fresh water. In the same way, everybody should concern with the global shortage of fresh water and go all best to sollut it.

People always think the fresh water is enough, no matter how much we use. Because the fresh water has lots of resources, such as raining water, river . . . But in fact, the global shortage of fresh water is a large problem. Because now we use more water. There are three reasons. At first, when the population increases, people will use much more water. Secondly, when the industy improves, we must use more water to get more productors . The next , when the pollutions are more serious, water is polluted, too. So the shortage of water is serious. We should save water. We must make full use of water. And we can not polluted water.

Fresh water, though it is essential to our lives, was once attached to less importance. For it was thought that fresh water is never-using-up , like air around us. People are easily seeing water can be getten from a brook, or under ground. But in fact fresh water, is scarce nowaday . With the population getting great, more and more fresh water are needed for all kind of purposes. Especially, industry develops rapidly and at the same time the pollution is seriese all over the world. We can often hear the fresh water crisis on the radio now. As a result, we must launch compaigns to survive this crisis. First of all, everyone who want our future bright should put the limited fresh water to good use. We occasionally catch a sight of a dripping pipe especially in public building such as doom-building , dining-room, and office building . Second, the government should take a great effort to find way in which man can change easily water in sea into fresh water. As it is wellknown nearly 70% surface of the earth is covered by the oceans. If we found the proper way, we would never be threatened by the fresh water crisis. Last but not least, we should keep our earth from polluting . we know that the one who can win the earth just is human himself. Generally speaking, the global shortage of fresh water must be considered vital to man's pursuit of happiness.

As population is larger and larger, people use more and more water. Industry use water also more and more . And there is a part of water which are dirty, and can't be used. So the water can be used is less and less. And some countries have been short of it. In this condition, what we should do? We must make good use of water, and save it. We should make all people know this.

Number of people are adding, and polution is raising , water is getting more and more important for us. It is known to all that there is no life without fresh water, therefore we ought to save water. We can't be afraid of shortage of fresh water. We must do some things immediately, first, we must control proplutation . Secondly, factory must clean the portuted water and save water.

In fact, fresh water is very shorten . The population of every country is increasing. The fresh water people used is more and more. And due to pollution fresh water which can be used is less than before. So the global shortage of fresh water is very serious. What can we do for it? First, we ought to do our best to save fresh water. There would be a great deal of fresh water if everyone of us saves a cup of fresh water every day. Second, we should invent some machine which can convert sea-water to fresh water. If we do that successfully, the shortage of fresh water will not be a problem.

First, the population of the world is increased. Everyone need water, so more person need more water. Second, the developing industry need more and more water than that several years ago. Third, that the prolution make a lot of fresh water can't be used. Because we can't life without water, shortage of fresh water becomes a big problem now. How can we do something for it? First, I think, we should make full use of every drop of water. Second, we should let the population increased slowly than before. Third, we can decrease the population and let more water can be used. In order to solve the problem, let us try our best.

But in fact, there is a global shortage of fresh water. It is one of the biggest problem which human being faced now and in furture . Fresh water is needed and used much more than before because of the increasing of population and the developing of industry. And fresh water pollution makes less water can be used by human being . How can we do. I think we do somethings to cope with the trouble. We can't waste fresh water any more in the first place. Scondly , we must use water when and where they are needed most. The last and not the least. we must to find new sourse of fresh water or make other water to fresh water, etc.

People all think that the fresh water isn't limited, because it ofter rains and There is we many rivers on the earth. In fact. fresh water is very shortaged . There is much fresh water of the nature, but there are much more people to drink it and much more factories to use it. So the global shortage of fresh water becomes our first problem. How to deal with it? I think that there is two ways to deal with it. The first , the government should make a plan on giving fresh water. The second, every person should make full use of fresh water. Rome wasn't built in a day, I hope to have enough fresh water after several years because of our hard working.

For many years people have thought that fresh water is much enough for us to use and it won't be drawn . It has many sources, for example rainwate , riverwater , well water and so forth. It is very limited that water is used by a man and it can be recycled. In fact it is very short of fresh water. With population increasing, fresh water is used much more than before. Mean while much fresh water can't be used by pollution. Thus it is a very serious problem that it is short of fresh water. In order to live, we shall solve the problem. How can we deal with the problem? First we shall use the fresh water enconomically . If every one can do this, it will save much waste fresh water to use. Second we shall avoid pollution. Pollution is dangerous for our lives, so we need to avoid this . The last we should also controll the population. It is very important for us to control population not only to solve the problem but also to live in this beutiful globe in the future.

Fresh water is very important to us. We must use fresh water every day. Because there are much fresh water, for example, rain water, river water, and so on. People think that we can not use up fresh water. In fact, we are very short of fresh water. Because of increasing of population and the industrilizm . we need much more fresh water than before. Morever , because of pollution. We can use less fresh water. In the recently years. our country are also very short of fresh water. How can we deal with this problem? We must save fresh water at first place. Don't waste water because water is our lives. Secondly, we must use water for second time . Thirdly, we can study how to turn sea water into fresh water. Please remember water is very important to us. Don't wast water.

Global is shortage of fresh water. We must use fresh water ecnomically . In the old days, people thought that the fresh water was endless, there was plenty of fresh water in the land, such as rivers, lakes, wells. Also there is so much rain. But in fact, fresh water is very very scarce. Population in our world is increasing fast. The more people bear , the more water will occupy . The development of industry is another reason. More and more water is used in the producing of industry. Third, the polluted water has polluted other fresh water, such as river and lake . The fresh water people can use has become little. From above we can see that our world is in great need of fresh water. Global is shortage of fresh water. We must save fresh water and use it ecnomically .

Many people had thought that the use of fresh water isn't limited, because in our life, there is much fresh water such as rain, river , etc. Seeing from this, many people pay no attention to the shortage of fresh water. But it is not the case. Actrally fresh water is in shortage. First, we can see many forms of fresh water, but do you notice water is recycling? It changes from the form to another, water in river turns into clouds, and clouds turn into rain, the result is that water goes back to river. So the quantity of water is not as much as you had thought. Secondly, water is limited, but there are so many people in the world, according to the population, water is very short. In the third place, though seas cover more than half surface of the globe, but water in sea can't be drunk. To the last , the important one is water used in industry has been increased greatly, and the polution in water is very serious. Draw to the conclusion, we must fully realize that the shortage of fresh water is very obvious to us. So what we should do is to save every drop of water, make it fully used. Wasting water should be criticized. The problem is so important that it associated with the exitence of human.

We can touch fresh water everyday and everywhere. We can see fresh water when it rains, we can get it from river or well . So some people consider that fresh water is so much that it can be used forever. In fact, the problem of shortage of fresh water is serious. The creasing of the popullation and the development of the industy both reqire more and more fresh water. The most important reason is pollution, which polute the sourse of fresh water and make it too dirty to use. For people's living, we must realize the global shortage of fresh water at first; The second one, we must control the use of the fresh water reasonablly ; The third one, also the important one, we must protect the sourse of fresh water in any way.

On our blue earth, there is about 70 percent of the surface covered with water. So many people think that fresh water will never been worn out. Of course, there is much fresh water we can use: rain water, river water, water from wells etc. But there is only 3 percent of all the water on the earth we can make use of because 97 percent is sea water or salt water. The ideas of those people are utterly wrong. In fact fresh water is scarce. At present, the supply of fresh water can't meet people's needs. The increasing of our population led to much more needs of fresh water than before. And fresh water used for industrial productive is also increasing. The most terrible problem is that a lot of water has been polluted seriously. So the problem of the shortage of fresh water becomes more and more noticeable. What should we do now? First, everyone should save every drop of water and make use of fresh water effectively. Second, we ought to decrease the pollution of water and protect our fresh water resource. The most important point is that we can find some ways to improve the recycle of water in order that we can reuse the water which has been used.

Fresh water is a very important resourse in the world. There is a plenty of rain in different areas every year. Also there are many rivers, on the earth. In addition, there is much water under the ground. These all are fresh water. So, maybe people will say that fresh water is unlimitted . In fact fresh water is very limitted . The population is increased and every one of us need fresh water. Industry needs more and more fresh water. Morever , there is pollution of fresh water. As a result, the problem of fresh water shortage has come out. So what shall we do? Firstly we must control the population. Secondly we shouldn't waste fresh water. lastly we ought to control the pollution. If we do these, the fresh water will be enough to us, and our lives will be more happy .

Fresh water is necessary to everyday life. Such as drink , wash and so on. Many people think that fresh water will not be ran out of . Because they believe that when it rains, we have water, and we can get water from the river and the well . What they thought is wrong. In fact fresh water is very short of. With the development of industry, more and more fresh water was used. And the increasing of population also need lots of water. What's more, many rivers were polluted by the wasted water of factories. So what we can make use of become less and less. What can we do? First, we should control the increasing of population, and purify the waste water before it is drained from the factory. Second, we should make full use of it, not waste it. By doing so, I thought , we can keep the balance of water circulation .

Nowadays, many people still think that fresh water will not be used up for ever. They think, there is so much fresh water. For example, we can get fresh water from rivers and wells. We also can get when it rains. They think that we can see fresh water everyday and we can use them freely. At fact, however , fresh water is of global shortage. There are the several reasons. First, the population has increased. Second, the industry water has also expanded . Third, the waste water that many factory have given off has been polluting the river . So fresh water is getting shorter and shorter. Now, what should we do? We must try our best to make good use of little water. Every mustn't waste fresh water. And we should educate those people who think fresh water will not be used up for ever and let them know fresh water is very short.

People often take for granted that fresh water will never be used up. Because there is rain every year, the streams' and the rivers' water is flowing every day, and the wells' water also full. Why should we worry about it ? Actually, the shortage of fresh water is serious, especially in big cities. Today, with the increasing of population, more fresh water is need . But the development of industry has used up more our water, and it causes so much pollution that has made many water resources unfit for people to drink. The water resource is related to our survial . Facing the shortage of fresh water, how can we do with it? To save water is important, we must use as less water as possible. The second, we must reduce the pollution to the water, so we can use all the water resource . At last , we should plant trees to store more water.

People often think fresh water can not be used up. There are so many rivers and wells in the world. And two thirds of the surface of earth is covered by water. Perhaps these reasons have made people be so optimistic about our fresh water. In fact, fresh water isn't so full . On the contrary, it is very short. First, fresh water doesn't cover all over the world. There are many place which have no fresh water. They are dersert . Second, with the growth of the population, the increasing of the water-using in the factories and the polution of fresh water, fresh water is shorter than ever. Finally, many people don't save fresh water. They think water is so cheap that it isn't worth saving. How should we do for it? First, we should save water and not waste every drop of water. Second, we should use water in efficent ways. Finally, we should exert to make for new resource of fresh water to solve the problem of fresh water. We should take care of our fresh water because we can not live without water.

People think that the fresh water provided from nature is endless. "There is so much rain, river, well and so on," they think so . This is the reason why so many people waste the fresh water. Actually, the fresh water all over the world is very short. With the increasing of population and because of pollution, the amount of fresh water decreased. We are calling for fresh water. To reach our desire, we must oppose the action of wasting fresh water. Every plant must make good use of fresh water. We are sure we can. And we issue warnings, "Global Shortage of Fresh Water!"

Men can't live without fresh water. But many people think that the fresh water will never run out. We can fetch the fresh water from the well , the rain and the river , so men needn't worry about the shortage of fresh water. However, in fact the global shortage of fresh water is a big problem. First the increasing population and the development of the industry make more shortage of the fresh water. people now use more fresh water than years ago. And the pullution has make much fresh water can't use again, so we can't ignore the problem of shortage of fresh water any more. So we must make best use of fresh water. as fresh water is limitted , we must reduce the waste of fresh water. We can't waste even a drop of fresh water. Another important thing we should do is to solve the question of pollution then we can use the water again and again . And only then we will not worry about the problem.

Nowaday , saving water is called on everywhere, people think that fresh water has no end, because the scource of fresh water such as rain, river , sea, well and so on is unlimited. In fact, fresh water in the world is very short. The reasons leading to that are several parts. Firstly, the increase of the population makes fresh water reduce quickly. People's lives can't depart from fresh water and without fresh water people can't life. Secondly, the increase of the factory's usage of water is a threat to people. Recently, more factory are built and they need more fresh water to stand for their productions. The last important reason is the pollution. People take more attention to it. It courses some fresh water not to be used. Under the statement , We should save water. In the other hand, we should use the techenolege to reuse the polluted water. We should try our best to protect the nature from pollution.

Many people think the fresh water won't be shortage. Wherever we often see river, rain, lake etc. That what we drink, use in normal life are all from them. Without fresh water, we can hardly live through short period . In fact, the fresh water is very lack . Population increases, water for industry use add to and pollution make so much water insuitable for drink and use. The 99 percent of fresh water are stored in icebug . So the fresh water that could be used by us is very little. In some land ,especially in Africa, water-lack has caused many person's sick and death. Saving water is saving life! How should we do in dealing with the water-lack ? First, we should make everyone of us get a education of water importance. It can call on us to protect water from polluting . And then we should think how to use water in icebuy and turn the sea-water into fresh water. Our living standard would certainly rise after our solving the water problem.

Many people in world may think of fresh water as an immense resource. It can get from rain, rivers and wells through which people can reach underground water. However, fresh water are in the shortage, there are three reason why shortage of fresh water come to . First, today, there are more and more people in the earth and more fresh water are used in daily life. Next, our industry are increasing. A lot of fresh waster are used in production. Last but not least, polution is a importent factor. With development of our socitry , so much fresh water resources are polutted by some factory , so people have limited fresh water available. How can we solute this problem? We should consume fresh water more appropriately. And, there so many water on the surface of the earth, we invent a economied way to revert sea water to fresh water. If we can do it prefectly . we will really own immense fresh water.

People often think that fresh water can not be used up forever. The reason is that there is really a great deal of fresh water in the earth such as water of rain liver or well . But actually fresh water is quite shortage. On the first hand, the amount of fresh water is immense, but on the other hand the use of fresh water is also immense. The population and pollution are increasing, which cause the increase of using fresh water. Morever , the development of industry, requires more and more fresh water. So we have less fresh water to use than we used to have. What measures should we take to solve the problem? First, the government should pay more attention to the education of the reasonable use of water. Second, we should apply morden methods to turn salt water of sea into fresh water. If we can turn Ocean water into fresh water effectively, we needn't worry. Third, the government should take actions to decline the birthrate and pollution.

People always take for granted that fresh water is not limited. They often see rain and snow. The rivers always full of cleaning water. Indeed, we can bring fresh water from river and lake . But fresh water is limited. In fact, fresh water is very short. First, the population is larger than before, so we must expend more fresh water to meet the need of daily life. Secondly, we must expend more fresh water in industry as industry is devolpping , Thirdly, it is most important that more and more fresh water is polluted. As a result, the fresh water we have today is less than before, we are short of fresh water. Human beings can't live without fresh water. We are short of fresh water. We must make full use of it. We must take steps to clean the polluted water. We will bring fresh water from polluted water in the future.

Some people think that fresh water can never be used up. If it rains there will be fresh water we can use. Moreover, there is lots of fresh water in the rivers and wells. On the contrary, the problem of global shortage of fresh water was put forward. Since, population increases, fresh water for industry adds and a lot of rivers is polluted by industry, the available fresh water is rare. In some countries, fresh water is more valuable than gold. Then, what we should do against the shortage of fresh water. For us, fresh water is of vital importance to maintain our lifes . Without water, we can't live more than seven days. Hence, we should not waste the water. And, we should do our's best to prevent the resource of fresh water from pollutation . The last but no least, we should take best advantage of the limited resource of fresh water to do more work.

Many people always think that the fresh water is unlimitted . In their opinions, all the water is fresh water, so the water in rains, rivers, wells and seas is able to be drinken and used. But in fact, the fresh water is very limitted , for a lot of water on earth isn't fresh water and we can't drink and use it. What's more, because of the improvement of population, industraies and pollution, the fresh water is becoming less and less. Being lack of fresh water, many grasslands have turned into deserts. Then facing such an important problem what should we do? Of course we have to find much more resources of fresh water. But what's the most important is to save fresh water. If we don't pay attention to it, we'll as some one says, the last drop of the water is our tear.

It is probably well considered that the fresh water is limitless. There are many sources where we can take fresh water like the rain and the river . So we must never worry about it. In fact, the fresh water is limited. In recent years, the increase of population, the increasing amount of water used for industry and the polution of the water, make our resource of fresh water reduse . Today we must face with the problem of global shortage of fresh water. Can we do something to improve the situation? Yes, the factory must not pour the poluted water into the river . We must consume fresh water the amount the we just need. We must use fresh water reasonally . If we all can do that, the problem of global shortage of fresh water can be solved.

People always believes that we are never lack of fresh water. If someone oppose to it, they'll say that there is so much water, in river, in dam, in well , even in iceburg , so we never worry about the shortage of fresh water. In fact, fresh water source is very limited. First, with the increasement of gloral population the average water-consumption has greatly reduced insttan . Secondly, in the 20th century, gloral industry has greatly advanced, with the problem that water consumption has increased. At last , more and more serious pollution has increased the contradiction between water source and consumption. Facing such serious problem, what should we do? On the one hand, we must save water and tell our children to do so. On the other hand, we must prevent water source from pollution. Finally, we should develop the technology which can convert sea water to fresh water. We should try our best to prevent global shortage of fresh water.

Water is very important for us. Like oxyion , we can't leave it for a moment especisaly fresh water. During a long time people think that fresh water can be used endlessly. we got it from rains, rivers, and so on. In fact, Fresh water is in global shortage. The large popullation is still larging . the requiring water of industy is increasing. the pollutaion problem is more obvious. The shortage of fresh water is a important problem facing with us. Thus , How we can do with the global shortage of fresh water? Firstly, and I think it most important that we should make good use of fresh water. Each of us should straggle with the behavior of wasting water. And then , the earth surface is mostly covered with the sea. Although the water in the sea can't be dirictly used. We might get fresh water from it in some way.

People think that fresh water can not be used out. First, it rains very often in the world. Second, there are a lot of big rivers on the earth. Third, fresh water can be got by digging wells. But in fact, fresh water is not enough. First, now population increases very quickly and more people need more water. Second, with the development of industry, more water must be needed. Third, much fresh water is poluted and it can not be used. Then how can we do? The most important thing for us is to save water. Getting rid of polution is also important. Then we can have enough fresh water to use.

The water we can use straightly is fresh water. It's including rain, river water, well water and so on. Some people may think that there is plant of fresh water on the earth we can use, Because we often see rain falling, water flowing in the river and well water coming out well. In fact, fresh water is very rare. If the total water on the earth is 100%, while fresh water is only 3% including ice-beg , water deep under the land. So that we can use is very little. In present, with the increasing of population and industry, the require of fresh water is increasing. Unfortunately, the very fresh water is polluted more and more seriously. Fresh water is limited. What shall we do? I think every one should think carefully of it. First per person should save fresh water. Second pollution of water should be decreased or got rid of. Further more we can clean the sea water and change it to fresh water.

We must use water everyday. Of course I means fresh water. We can't use sea directly. In the old days, even now, many people always think that fresh water is enough for us to use forever. We can gain fresh water from rain, river and so on. Also we can get it from our wells. But if fact, we now have to face the shortage of fresh water. with the development of our society, factory will use much more fresh water than they used to and they always send out their waste which polluted our fresh water. Also the increasing of population will make the shortage of fresh water more sharp . Now, shortage of fresh water has become a global problem. what shall we do to deal with it? First, we should carry out birth-controll . Second, we should reduce the pollution. Third, but not last, we should not use some fresh water for only one time. We should reuse it. Modern science has provide it possible. If all factories reuse their fresh water for several time , even for ever, we can save a lot of fresh water. I think, once people realize the importance of fresh water, it is only a time question to find ways to solve the problem of global shortage of fresh water.

People believe that the fresh water is not shortage for ever in the world. Because there are much rain which can increase the fresh water every year. Even , we have many rivers to be made use of. But , in fact, the fresh water is shortage very much . With the increasing of population and using enough in the factory, the fresh water is getting shorter and shorter. Facing the terrible fact, what should we do? First, we must develop the habit of saving the water in our life. Second, we should control the population. The last , we must limit the water using by the factory and forbide some wastes to be fallen into river.

Many people take it for granted that fresh water is very numerous. Because we can get fresh water from rivers, lakes and wells and so on and so forth. Of course, we also can get it when it rains. But , in fact, fresh water is very short. Agriculture, industry and people's daily life are all in need of large of fresh water. And with the development of industry, agriculture, with the increasement of populations, the need is enlarging. As the meantime, agriculture and industry produce large of poisonous water which has poluted many rivers and lakes. The situation is very serious. And then, what should we do? In the first place, we must improve our efficision of agriculture and industry so that we can save a lot of fresh water. Secondly, we should do with the poluted water from agriculture and industry before it is given off . At last, remember! Save water in daily life. We should get into good habit of saving water. So long as we do our best, the problem can be solved.

The 71% surface of the earth is coverd by water. So people always say "The earth is a waterful ball ". And most of them will be accordingly think it for granted that there is plenty of fresh water in the earth. However, this is not the truth. It can be concluded from some researching work that. Africa is shortage of fresh water, China is shortage of fresh water, and the whole world is also shortage of fresh water. So every government appeals to his people to save water, is what causes the bad situation. There are two reasons. One is sea water can't be applied for people needs. There is so much chemical material in sea water that we can drink it. And turn sea water into fresh water is very expensive, so people can't make the use of sea water. The other is human beings' bad behivor . The large numer of people, the increasing needs of water, and the deadly pollution, all these make fresh water we can use less and harmful. What can we do about this? Every one of us should do from himself, do from now , saving a drop of water. Then the problem can possibablely be solved.

Most people always think that fresh water are not likely to be used up. They think it will rain at times, and the rivers are always full of fresh water as the lakes are, and we even can get the fresh water under the ground. As a matter of fact, fresh water is quite of shortage. With the population, increasing quickly, the need of fresh water in dairly life also go on . Nowadays, the industry rapid increase , so the industrial need of fresh water are going up so quickly. The polution of water is also a serious problem. The great fresh water resource such as the rivers, the lakes and so on are being great poluted . In face of the poluted water, how we have a happy life? So we must take steps to deal with the problem--global shortage of fresh water. But how should we deal with it? We must firstly control the population increasing . Second, we should take steps to prevent fresh water from poluting again.

At past, people always consider that the fresh water is so much that we can use it forever. In fact, the fresh water is of shortage now, because the population increased quickly in past few years, and with the progress of science, the water that factory used increased, too. And as a result of the progress of science, the pollution make the fresh water little and little . What shall we do to protect the fresh water? We should save each drop of water when we use it. That don't waste each drop of water is what we can do to prevent the fresh water from shortage .

Many people think that fresh water will be not used up. The rain and river all can provide the fresh water. They are the great resource of nature. In fact, the fresh water is very shortage. With the development of population and industry, people use the fresh water much than before, the polution of fresh water are also increasing. More waste liquid and gas are given out by some factories. Mankind are facing a problem that the clean fresh water resource are more and more scarce . People mush take some effictive preasures to convent the remain fresh water. First we must discrease the polution and clean the water of industry. We must make good use of the fresh water and not waste it. Mankind can't live without fresh water, Everyone should save it on daily life. The global shortage of fresh water will be overcome.

Most people think that fresh water is not limitted . We can use all kinds of water, rainwater, riverwater and so on. So they often wast water. But in fact, fresh water is very limitted . The increasing population results in more fresh water is needed. The water used by industry is increasing too. Even more , more and more rivers are pollutted and we can't use them . Under this condition, many big cities are short of water. What should we do to solve the problem. First, we should not wast water but should make the best of it. Second, we should not allow every factory to pollute the river .

Some people take it for granted that the fresh water can't be used up on our earth. There are so much rain every year and we have a lot of rivers and wells from which we can get fresh water. So they think that It must be a joke that our fresh water is used up. In fact, The fresh water is very short. As you know, the population of would increased quickly. As a result that the supply of fresh water must increase. Morever , the industry must develop quickly so that we can produce more things to meet our needs. The industry also need a lot of fresh water. On the other hand, with the development of industry, the pollution has become a big problem. Every years , there are so much fresh water polluted that we can't use it. In order to get more fresh water, we should do many things that we can do. When we are using fresh water, we should realise that our fresh water is short and save it.

Water shortage may be a strange problem to us. Because there are three quarters of the earth's surface covered with water. Everyday we can look water. However, Fresh water resources is very scarce. There are much water that is undrinkable. Furthermore, our need of fresh water is increasing. Not only we drink it, but also we use it to grow crops run modern factories, keep us and our house clean. on the other hand, the growing population forces us to face with water shortage. A way to solve the problem of water shortage is circulate the water resource. Water can be use many time by diffierent ways. We should make full use of water. Fortanitily more and more people realize the global shortage of fresh water and try their best to solve it.

For many years, people have taken it for granted that water can never be used up. The rain, the river, and the well , etc. can be used as resouces of water. Hence, we haven't worried about water for so long. But in fact, the earth lacks of fresh water badly. The population increase quickly, and the indistry of nations is encouraged to develope faster and faster. So , as a result, more and more fresh water is requied . What's more, the pollution problem is becoming more seriouse . Now we have to face the terrible shortage of water. How can we do to fight against the shortage of fresh water. At first, we should try to make everyone know the importance of water-saving . Sencondly , we should properly limite the use of fresh water in people's daily life. The third, also is the most important, is to improve our technology, So that factories can reduce the demanding of fresh , and can put fresh water into recycle . Also, we can get rid of the pollution of water in a better way with developed technology.

People always think that there is so a large amount of fresh water that there is enough fresh water for ever on the globe. In fact, we can get fresh water from many ways: rain , river , spring ,. . . and so on. So people consider that however much fresh water we ask for the globe will offer. Some people even think that fresh water will never be shortage. Though the earth is covered with water on three forth surface, fresh water is limited. First in recent year, the population of the world is increasing rapidly. More and more fresh water will be requested . Second, with the development of industry, a lot of new factories come up. They all use a large amount of fresh water. Third, in these days, many fresh water has been polluted. Of course, there are other factors leading to the global shortage of fresh water. In order to solve the problem of shortage of fresh water, I think we should take the following steps: First, we should improve our science and find a solution to use other kind of water, for example, sea water. Second, we should try our best to save fresh water. We should make good and fully use of every drop fresh water. And the latest but not least, we should fully realize the global shortage of fresh water and the important of saving fresh water.

Water is very important in the world nowdays . Some people think that resourse of water is numorous . There is rain water, river water, and so on. They think that there is much fresh water for us to use, and they pay little attention to the water problem we are facing. Though there is much fresh water, We use more fresh water. In fact, water is limited. The shortage of water is very serious. With the development of industry and with the increasing of population, more and more water must be used. People drink water. Factory uses water to produce. Without fresh water people can't live, and factories can't run properly. Then, too , the pollution of water is very serious. Pollution makes much fresh water become undrinkable water. If people polluted water, they will get ill even they will have danger of death. To deal with shortage of water we should make workable solutions. First, we should make use of fresh water effiently . We can't waste water. In addition, we must prevent water from being polluted. Reusing water can also do help to shortage of water. Morever , with the development of technology, we can convert sea water into fresh water. In all, In order to supply plenty water, we must try our best to solve shortage of water.

People think fresh water is unlimited and we can use it at any time. They think there are so many sources of fresh water such as rains, rivers and wets that we don't need to worry about the shortage of fresh water. On the contrary, the problem of global shortage of fresh water is serious. First, the population has been rapidly increasing since this century. It leads to the decreasement of the average water which one owns. Second, by the increasement of industrial water, the fresh water decreases faster. Third, the polution is geting worse and worse, which make the shortage of fresh water more serious. In spite of these problems, we can solve the shortage as long as we make efforts. We must make birth plans to control the population. At the same time, we must protect our environment and limit the polution at all lengths . By these means, the fresh water will be sufficient, not short in the future.

Today, many people think that water is enough for our lifes . We can get water from rain, rivers, and wells, and so on. But in fact, fresh water is not enough. There are three reasons, I think, for the shortage of fresh water. First, population increase very quickly so that the needs of fresh water are increase too. Second, the needs of the industrial water is increasing. Finally, the pollution on the world is serious. Much of water is polluted, and it can't be used. What shall we do? I think we should make full use of a drip of water. We shouldn't waste water. In short, we should do all we can do.

People always think that fresh water is unlimitted , how much we need how much we will have. Fresh water is in everywhere, in lakes, in wells, in streams, etc. But in fact, the global is short of fresh water. First, recent years, industrial is developing quickly, at the same time the rivers are polluted, the water has been unfit for drinking. Second, every year millions of babies are born, the world population is bigger and bigger. Third, in desert area there is fewer water to use. These are not all, there are still many factors which make mankinds short of fresh water. What should we do now? There are two ways to solve the problem. One is inventing a new machine to turn sea water into fresh water; the other is saving every drop of water. Fortunately, man are awaring of the problem and have take some steps to solve it. We sure man will solve the problem soon.

There are millions of rivers, lakes and wells on the earth, so we may think that the fresh water is plentiful and we will never use it up. In fact, almost all the cities are short of fresh water today. In the first place, the total number of human being increased quickly in the past fifty years. It has been over 50 billion today. Secondly, factories use more and more fresh water, and those factories also produce too many rubbish. The rubbish poluted many rivers and lakes, That caused fresh water more limited. So, what can we do for the fact. Firstly, we must control the increasing of population. secondly , protect earth. That is the very reason.

Fresh water is an important thing of our life, this is dearly . In common view, fresh water will never be used out . Those who support this opinion may think there are so many source of it such as rain, river , lake and so on. Is this time? No, we can say no surely. This is a result on the surface of the fact. If we know the conditions of somewhere , we will find that fresh water is seriously poor. The population is raising rapidly, the development of industry need more and more fresh water, the polution of the fresh water is more serious than before. . . All of these make the global shortage of fresh water more obviously -- the support is limited but the need is increasing. Knowing this fact, people have started to find a useful way to solve it . What should we do? Scientists have searched the answer for many year and get several way . For example, they find the iceberg is made up of fresh water, we can tranffer it to hot place then we can get fresh water. They also find using chemical or physical way to change water in the sea into fresh water. But all these way need a lot of money. Then socialists consider we should limit the use of fresh water. Nowaday , There is well known words says "We have only one earth!"

People think that there are a great deal of fresh water in the earth. We should not afraid of the shortage of fresh water. Because we can gain fresh water from different way , such as rain, river , sea and so on. But the fact is that fresh water are limited. Today, the population of the world are rapidly developing and more and more fresh water are using in industry, which make fresh water be shortage. That's more, the polution is found everywhere. By these reason , fresh water are more limited. What can we do against the global shortage of fresh water. First we must control the developing of the population in the world. Second we must make good use of fresh water. Last , the polution must be controled . In the way we will have more fresh water and a clean earth.

Water is a part of our life, and we can see water everywhere. For example, raining , water in river , water in well and so on. People always think we will never be short of water. In fact, we are very short of water now. Industries use more and more water, and poluted in the water is very serious. Everybody use water everyday, and the population is rising rapidly now so fresh water is serious shortage. How should we do now? We must take steps to protect our fresh water. First, we can't waste even a drop of water. Second, the industries must do well with the water and try their best to clean to wasted water.

People think there are lots and lots fresh water that we can use, such as the rain water, the river water, etc. But in fact, the shortage of fresh water is very global. Why do I say that the shortage of fresh water is very global? First, the population become larger and larger, so we need more and more fresh water. Second, with the development of the industry, more and more factor need fresh water. Fresh water is used to clean machines, too cool machines etc. Last but not least, the pollution of fresh water is a very difficult problem. Though more and more scientists study how to solve this problem and more and more people realize this problem, a lot of fresh water is polluted. So I say fresh water is limited. How can we solve this problem. We should do our best to save fresh water. For example, we should make good use of fresh water. After cleaning our faces, we can use the water to wash our clothing, or to clean the floor. We can advice other people not to waste fresh water. As students, we can learn how to solve the problem of the pollution of fresh water. We can do many things.

People suppose that fresh water is endless. The rain is fresh water, the water flowing in the river is fresh water, the water of well is fresh water, too. It seems that fresh water is so rich that we can use it for million years. But in fact, fresh water is global shortage. It is well known that in recent years the population is increasing fast. Of course, the demand of fresh water is adding up . At the same time, with the development of industry, not only require a lots of fresh water but also the wasted water which piped from some factories went into some rivers and polluted it . So, the resource of fresh water is more and more decreasing. But what we should do? It is better to do than to say sorry, I think. The government must make laws to protect the resource of fresh water. We must control the industrial polluted water, clear it with some advanced technicals and recycle it. On the other hand, Each of us had better spare using fresh water. I believe, if we all treat it seriously, the problem of the global shortage of fresh water must be solved.

There are many lakes and rivers in the world. So people always think that the fresh water will not be over for ever. We know that the rain-water the river-water and the well-water is plenty. But in fact, the fresh water is in global shortage. Why? In the first place, the population is developing, it means that a great deal of water need to be used in life. In the second place, the industry is developing, which means that the quality of water used in industry must be exceeded. In the third place many lakes and rivers are polluted with the waste of chemical factories. So we can know the global shortage of the fresh water lying in the world now. Then what should we do? Obviously, we should make the good use of the fresh water instead of wasting it. For example, we ought to cut off the water after we use it and so forth. Let's do our best to solve the question of global shortage of fresh water.

Water is very important to us, for we cannot live without the water. Many people think that the fresh water is unlimited no matter how much we use. We can get the fresh water from the rain, the river, the well , the spring and many other places. Thus the fresh water is considered to be abundant. But actually, we're facing the problem of the shortage of fresh water. The shortage of fresh water results from the following. First, with the increasing of the population, our dayly need of the fresh water increases. Second, with the development of the industry, the industrial need of the water are increasing, too. And also , more and more water are poluted . the fresh water are getting shorter and shorter. From the above, we must realize that we 're short of fresh water. Having realized the problem, we should do next is to solve it. How can we ? In the first place, every one of us should be economical in using the water. We should save up each drop of water. We must grow the habit of saving up the water. In the second place, we should also control the birth, avoiding fast increasing of the popullation . Finally, we must prevent the fresh water from being poluted . Something should be done before the water from factories are flowing out. No waste would be permitted to put into the water. If we had done all these, our problem of the shortage of the fresh water would be solved partly. Now, let us call out: make good use of the water!

Now, there are also many people in the world who think that we have enough water on the earth. Of course, we often see the water of the rain, the river or the lake and so on. But it doesn't mean we have enough water to use every day. As we know, the population is increasing with the fast speed, and the water which is used in industry is also more than ever. To our uncomfortable , the industrial polution make the water we can use in our lifes shortage more . So we can see clearly that our water is so limited that there are a lot of people who live in a condition which is poor of water seriously. So we must face to a trubling problem. What ever can we do to resolve it? I think we must do as the following. In the first place, we should save every drop of the water everyday and if we all do just like that , what a lot of water we can save ! Secondly, we must clean the polution with every way we should try . After several years hard working to save the water, to clean the water, it'll be believed that we'll have a good life condition with enough fresh water in the future.

People take it for granted that fresh water is always enough to use because it rains every year and rivers are following all the time. But I have to say that it isn't necessarily the case. In fact, we are seriously shortage of fresh water. One reason is the increasing of population and industry. Our population has approached to 1. 2 billion and it is also on the rise, but the resource of fresh water doesn't increase at all. Furthermore, with the development of modern industry, the requirments of fresh water are amusing . The other reason is pollution. We all know that factories make a lot of polluted water which is sent to revers and makes it unfit to drink. What's more, trees are cut down and the recycling of water is distroyed . Then what can we do to deal with it? First is to save . Reduce the ammont of fresh water for everyday life. Second is to protect the resource of fresh water by planting trees. Finally, we should do our best to develop the technology of deriving fresh water from sea water.

People may think that fresh water is unlimited. We have a lot of fresh water. It is from rain, rivers, lakes and wells. So fresh water should not become a problem. But , in fact, we are very short of fresh water. Porpulation increases very fastly . More and more people need more and more fresh water. Morden industrial develops much quickly. Its need of fresh water is increase , too. unfortunately , plenty of fresh water is polluted. It becomes useless. So fresh water shortage becomes a global problem. What can we do? First, I think, we must save the fresh water. Second, we must protect our surroundings and prevent fresh water from pollution. Finally, we can make the polluted fresh water clean again. It can be used in industrial . I think, if we realize the problem and do something about it, we can overcome fresh water shortage.
