Nowadays, private tutoring has become a common phenomenon. Though children are well educated in schools, to make progress or to make up for what's missed out in the school, parents will choose to employ a private tutoring teacher to instruct their childrens[fm2, children] in home.
In fact, people differ in the views of private tutoring. Some suppose private tutoring has benefits to teachers and children. As to[wd1, as for] teachers who might be undergraduates, first, they can earn extra money to pay for the educatial[fm1, educational] expenses. Second, They have a [np2, an]opportunity to adapt to society and it contributes to their communicating skills.
However, there are opposite ideas about private tutoring. These pople[sw, people] believe it has lots of disadvantages. To the children, they will have heavy stress.

With the more and more attention parents pay to their children's education, the phenomenon of private tutoring is now becaming[fm1, becoming] more and more common.
Strictly speaking, we can't say it is wrong or right absolutely. And[sn2] private tutoring has its advantages and disadvantages. As for the advantages, first of all, it is true that private tutoring can make a pvomotion[fm1, promotion] on your[wd1, the] children's study and get a good grade[sn1] [sn2]. Besides, we can learn something which we can't obtain from the class via our tutor. On the other hand, private tutoring means that we will set aside extra time from our study time.
As I think it[wd2, as far as I am concerned], pivate[sw] tutoring isn't a sensible choice. We should learn to solve our study problems on our own.

Now, the phenomenon that parents hire a teacher in family for their chidnen's[fm1, children's] study is commoner and commoner[a1, more and more common]. These teachers continue to teach children math, English , Chinese, and all most all subjects after school. 
There are both advantages and disadvantages in private Turtoring[fm1, turtoring]. On the one hand, the family teachers sometimes can help the children a lot in their school work and solve the problems which the children meet with in homework. Besides, for some intelligent children, a family teacher can teach them more and new knowledge which can expand their eyesight[wd2, broaden their horizon]. On the other hand, the disadvantages is[np1, are] very obvious. After school, there will be less or even no time left for children to play. This will have a great influence on their character.

Nowadays, as the pressure of social competition is becoming heavier and heavier, it's important for us students to get a good school degree[np1, wd1, good scores]. For this reason, the phenomenon of private tutoring for kids is getting more and more widely[wd1, common] existed[vp3].
On one hand[wd2, On the one hand], private tutoring truly benefit some students to some extent. It provides extra teaching after school and put knowledge points[sn6, knowledge] across the students. Students can also solve their problems on time with the help of tutors. Overall, it is more likely for private tutoring to provide us with individual and appropriate teaching.
However, on the other hand, private tutoring many bring some unexpected harmful effects to us. Above all, we aren't able to take part in some after-school activities because of the lack of time.

And the teach can spend all his or her time on your children, which dislikes[np1, dislike] the school.

He or she may lose the chance to communicate with each other, and he[np1, he or she] can't exchange his[np1, his or her] ideas with his mates[wd1, partners], both in study and in life. In comparison, the school learning can make children more thinkable[wd1, thoughtful].

And things you unexpect[fm2, don't expect] may come, that's[wd2, that is] child may lose interest in study, you make a great[wd1, big] mistake.[sn1]

There are some advantages of having a private tutor. We can learn knowledge at home.

But some parents don't think it's a good idea to have a private tutor. They think it's bad for students' independent thinking ablity[fm1][sn6, independent thinking]. They think students should solve the problem by their own[wd2, on their own] and don't[wd1, shouldn't] depend on the tutor.
In my opinion, I think it's good to have a private tutor. But we should tell the tutor not to do everything for the children. The tutor can discuss with the children and lead them to find the anwser[fm1, answer].

It's normal that one teacher's teaching one student[sn6, private tutoring] can help the student understand what he learn[vp2, learns] better.

However, private tutoring maybe make [vp2, makes] children unhappy and aggressive because of restrictions and long study [sn2]. Worse still, some private tutors may harm children at times.
Given the above, I think approprivate [fm1, appropriate] private tutoring is better, which can help children with study and less wasteful time [sn6]. However, it is of great importante [fm1, importance] to find a good private tutor, because he will play a [np2, an] important role in the children's life. With a good tutor, the children will appreciate the private tutoring.

They can discuss problems together, which will help them more. What's more, teachers are good resources, why don't make full use of them? (A small joke). But it's true, we should discuss with the teacher more.

In recent years, the phenomenon of private tutoring has been more and more common. It's almost every parent's wish [sn6] that their son or daughter could get good grades [sn6] and get a better chance to have a respectable job several years later.
With private tutoring, students could work out the problems that they didn't work out in school. They might master the knowledge and skill better with regular training from their tutors. What's more, they also have the opportunity to communicate with tutors to learn more about the world. Hower [fm1, However], every coin has two sides. Some students may not be careful in school because they just rely on their tutors. In addition, they would lose the chance to think over by themselves. On this occasion, private tutoring will be a waste of not only the time of students but also the money of parents.
From my perspective, students should be aware of the importance of thinking by themselves. If some students really have trouble in study, private tutoring is also a method to help the students to improve [vp1] and make progress.

There is no doubt that private tutoring will be benefitial[fm1 beneficial] to children's study and can make the scores increase in a very short time. It works by solving students' confusion on certain objects and also teaching[sn2 by teaching] students the skills to deal with examinations.

For some children who didn't acquire knowledge [sn6] well at school, a private tutor is sort of necessary.

However, I have to admit that private tutoring has its disadvantages as well.

In my opinion, private tutoring should only come when it is really necessary. For most children, playing and communication is more important than learning in their youngth [fm1, youth]. So don't always try to find a private tutor for our little children!

Also, it will increase the economical burdens [np1, burden] of the family. Now, the CPI rises so quickly. So wasting much money isn't clever [sn6].
But, [sn2] having teachers at home can make children get better education. Their base at mathematics and English [sn6] will become better. They can learn harder subjects more easily.
I think it just depends on your grades. If your grades are good [sn6], you'd better develop your abilities. If your grades are not good, learning more is the best way. So I suggest that every child should work hard at school because the knowledge that the school give you is enough.

At the first sight, it appears so good that children would receive more excellent education. However, in my opinion, private tutoring is a double-edge sword. On one hand [wd2, On the on hand], despite the money to pay for the teachers [sn6], children would be more lazy when they are in the school because some of them hold the opinion that there is a 'mighty' [fm1, "mighty"] teacher at home to solve everything.

On the other hand, of course, private teachers may have a positive influence on children, and necessary [sn2], a teacher at home is helpful to solve a difficult problem, thus making kids gain progress.
As far as I can see, private tutoring results from the fact that many parents without complete edution [sn2] when they were young and they want to fulfill their dreams on their kids [sn6]. Never the less [fm1, Nevertheless], I am firmly convinced that private tutoring should not be laid beyond the schooling education. It is mainly due to the importance of schooling education that is improved by numerous generations. In this way, we can expect too much about the benefits of private tutoring. It is just one form of supplement to schooling education. There are lots of examples to illustrate this point, such as Emerison and Betran Russel, who both had a compelete [fm1, complete] education at school without private tutoring.
To sum up, private tutoring may do good things [sn6]. However, if we take the cultivation of independent thinking of kids [sn2, into consideration], it should be placed in the right position. Thus, when talking about private tutoring, we regard it only as one kind of supplement forms [sn6] to our schooling education.

People can't reach an agreement on this problem [wd1, issue]. Some people hold the view that private tutoring is good for children's development. For it can contribute to kids' knowledge and their kids can be the top students as well. But there are also some people who are opposite to that view. They think private tutoring will block the kids' natural development. Knowledge isn't the ultimate goal of the students [sn6]. Apparently, that's the advantages and disadvantages of the private tutoring. And from my point of view [sn2,] private tutoring will waste kids' too much time [sn6]. I like how someone puts it, "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy". Surely, we should concentrate more on students' practical skills. And we should give them more freedom.

First, why do we do it? I should say that the answer is obvious to [wd1, that is, to]help our children do better in their studys[fm2, studies]. But what's this for? Because if they do well in there[fm1, their] studys[fm2, studies] they will do well in their further works[np1, work], isn't it[sn1, won't they]? No, it isn't.[sn6, No, it isn't true.] Having a good score in each experiment doesn't means[vp5, mean] performing well at work as well.
Second, what does it brings[vp5, bring]? Sometimes it really works as we hopped[fm1, hoped], this can be shown on the results f [sw, of] exams.[sn1] But we should know what it takes away: the happiness of our children, their childhood, and so on. What do we hope for? One day they grow up have[vp3, having] their own baby and he or she asked[vp4, asks] them: "Tell me some stories of you, please." Then they will find that there is study in their memories only[sn5, only study in their memories]. 
At last, what to do?[sn2] On my own opinion[wd2, In my opinion]. [sn2] Private tutoring deserves nothings[np1, nothing]. Our children should have time to look at the society to learn how to get along with others, but not just how to study well. So stop doing it, give our children freedom and guide them behind[sn6], let them learn by their own.[sn1]

Things have two sides on one hand, private tutoring has its own advantages.[sn1] It not only make[vp2, makes] students study more clearly, and solve some problems which can't be solved on[wd2, in] the class, but also make[vp2, makes] some graduaters[fm1, graduates] who can't find a good job have a temperpory[fm1, temperory] job to live on.

Further more[fm1, Furthermore], many parents have to save money to afford the fee to invite[wd1, employ] house-teachers, which makes come[sw some] poor families poorer. 
In my opinion.[sn2] Private tutoring is a thing whose disadvantages more than its advantages[sn2].

But to some poor families, it is a way that is more harmful than meaningful[sn4, harmful rather than meaningful].

Not only the senior students get tutors, but also the primary students get tutors, they want to be the good students in their classes.[sn1] Mots[fm1, most] of the tutors are students from universities, and others are teachers.
Private tutoring has a lot of advantages just like these: first[sn2]. It can improve student's study and students can have private space[wd1, time] to shave[fm1, share] tutor's[np2, np1, the tutors'] experience which makes them have a good comprehension.

Nowadays, the phenomenon that parents hire teachers or college students to give their children private tutoring become more and more popular. Many parents force their children to attend private tutoring classes, without concerning[wd1, caring] how tired their children are.

However, some pros[wd1, some] argue that as students, they need to develop other skill like marking[fm1, making] friends, cooking and washing more than study. They need time to do this. But the private tutoring takes up too much time of them. Some students even have limited time to sleep! This is very harmful.
In my opinion, the phenomenon results from the love parents place on their children. But parents should put the love in a right way.

At present private tutoring is a very common phenomenon. In fact, it is the parents' love for their childen[fm1 children]. Parents want their children to be better for some reasons like[sn2] the teachers in school is[vp2 are] not good, or children themselves don't like to study at all, they search for the private tutoring.[sn1]
Private tutoring is a two-side sword. In one aspect, it is truly effective for students to study. While the teachers in school have one hundred or more students to teach, they cannot give someone[wd1 one person] much attention, but the private tutors only have one or two students, they can help them more, and then students can get higer[fm1 higher] rades[fm1 grades]. It is good for children for parents, and also for tutors. In another aspect.[sn2] It will lead[wd1 make] the children pay less attention to teachers in school, and when most studats[sw students] have private tutor[np1 tutors], it is not good for schooling.
In my opinion, private tutoring has more good[wd1 benefits], because students are kids, they cannot control themselves sometime[fm1 sometimes],[sn1] when a private tutor helps him or her, it is not only for his or her study, but also do[vp2 does] good to their development.[sn1] Private tutors can help children know how to study. That's the most important.

Nowadays, it is very common for parents to find a tutor for their children.
Because they think in this way, their children will learn more knowledge, and do better in studies. Of course, with the aid of tutors, the children can review their lessons during the day after class. And they may have more chances to get a satisfying grade in their texts[fm1 tests].
However, they will lose a lot of time[sn6 have little time] to study by themselves, which may bring about less creativeness. Furthermore, they may not have a high intelligence[np1 high intelligence].
Personally, private tutoring have[vp2 has] both advantages and disadvantages. And it has more disadvantages. Because if they do without a tutor, they will be more independent. And they will take an active part in thinking up ways to solve problems that confuse them. They will acquire more knowledge and experience which can't be taught by a tutor.
Different people have different tastes. It all depends. That's just my humble opinion.

Nowadays, it's common to call for private tutoring for children, which in parents' view is of great benefits to their children.
In my opinion, private tutoring may have positive influence on children.

There is no doubt that the teachers can help the students solve some problems that confused[vp4 confuses] them and tell them some ways to deal with study.

On the other hand, private tutoring has its shortcomings. Parents have to work hard to pay the private teachers, because of the expensive fee.

Therefore, from my point of view, there's no need to have a private teacher. If you can listen to the teacher carefully in school and try to develop the habbit[fm1, habit] of studying on your own, the excellent score is[vp4, will be] at hand.

Nowadays, more and more parents are willing to hire private tutors for the purpose to make their children stand out in studying.
The phenomenon has been wide spread for the reason that you can always find them on the campus when holidays draw near. It is obvious that with the tutoring of the private teachers their children are likely to achieve remarkable progress in study, which is exactly the purples[fm1][wd1, result] they anticipate. On the other hand, the college students whose families are not well-off may find solutions to [wd2, improve] their embarrassing financial situation by working as tutors during their leisure time.
However, we can't deny the fact that there are negative side[np1, sides] that exist hand in hand with the positive influence[wd1, ones]. The children may form the idea that they don't have to study hard in school because their parents will undoubtedly hire tutors to help their study later. As a result, they may fall behind other students too much and can't catch up with them forever.
In my opinion, private tutoring is necessary for those who are not good at studying. In most case, students themselves should learn to solve the problems in study in school with the aid of their teachers.

With the blooing[fm1, booming] of modern society and the rapid breakthrough of science and technology, the importance of knowledge doesn't need to say[sn6, self-evident]. As for many parents whose children don't do well in their study, private tutoring is the first maybe the only thing they can think of.
Obviously, private tutoring has some advantages. Because of its special way to teach students, it can help children to listen to the teachers more efficiently. And the teacher would be more concertrated[fm1, concentrated] on his/her only students, too. Extra exercises will also have effect on student's progress.
But I still don't think it a good way for students.

Nowadays more and more parents tend to have home teachers to help with their children's study. And private tutoring is becoming popular.
As a result of poor study[sn6, poor performance at school], many students can't deal with their homework independently hence,[sn5,, hence] they read[wd1, hire] private teacher to help them. To a degree, it can help them to learn better, but on the other hand, the students may rely too much on the private teacher and as a result, they won't develop a habbit[fm1, habit] to think and study independently. This is harmful to their future. Besides, some students got[vp4, get] private teacher so that they can learn extra knowledge and abilities. For example, some people learn to play plane[wd1, piano] with the help of home teacher. This can enrich their knowledge and bebefit[fm1, benefit] their future.

Nowadays, all the students has[vp2, have] a hard time learning the things they learned[vp4][wd1, are taught] at school and preparing for important exams. Many parents hire teachers to give their children a private tutoring.
Private tutoring is so common, especially in middle schools. It helps students to study well and get a better score. Even[wd1, If] you are not the top students in your class, a private tutoring can let you have a deeper understanding of the things you learned[vp4, have learned] than any other students. What's more, many college students get a chance to train themselves by doing part-time jobs as a private teacher.
But as every coin has two sides, private tutoring also has its disadvantages. It takes students too much time to study at home and there seems to be no time for students to do want[sw, what] they want. Students, especially Chinese students, are busy studying all day and it's hardly a good idea to let them have extra classes at home. Another important fact is,[fm1,/ that] all the teachers have their own way of teaching. A private teacher and a teacher in school[wd1, school teacher] certainly teaches[vp2, teach] in deffient[fm1, different] ways. Having classes from both of them is not always good for students to understand the knowledge. Last but not least, as many private teachers are just college students and have not[wd1, no] teaching experience, having them teaching[vp3, teach] your children may be just a waste of time and money.
In my opinion, private teaching is not for everyone. Think carefully and ask your children before making a decision. If you still find it necessary[fm1, ,] find a good teacher.

Private Tutoring can be helpful to the student's study.

It's a common phenomenon to have a private teacher for children, and[sn1,. And] it has advantages and disadvantages.
On the one hand, private tutoring is good for students. First of all, a private teacher can help you solve a problem which you don't know and tell you some good methods of learning.

Nowadays, finding a tutor for children is a vary common phenomenon because of the high pressure of study.
Many parents hope that their children get good grades so they find a private tutor for their children. It may have great effect on their children. A good tutor might be a good example to learn. Meanwhile, the child can solve the problems at first time[wd1, in time]. Also, the tutor is younger then[fm1, than] their parents and teachers.

With the development of the society, knowledge becomes more and more important. In China, you grasp a high chance to acquice[fm1, acquire] great knowledge and to learn well if you attend a famous or significant[wd1, prestigious] school. To reach the purpose, you have to pass many exams. Hence, getting a private tutor to help their children becomes the choice of a great number of parents.
As an old saying says, each coin has two sides. There is no exception for private tutoring. On the one hand, it can improve children's ability to study to some extent and offer the tutor some money to support himself.

At present the phenomenon that parents employ private tutors for their children is very common. On my last holiday, I became a tutor for the first time, and knew something about this job. But is it proporiate[fm1, appropriate] for parents to employ tutors?
The advantage of private tutoring is obvious. Above all, it can make students spend more time on studying so that they can get good grade. Beside, commuticating[fm1, communicating] with tutors can fill their thinking[wd1, develop their thinking ability] and [wd1, enrich their] experience. The last but not least, employing a tutor will give the parents more freedom.
But every coin has two sides. The disadvantages of private tutoring are unavoidable. Firstly, it will waste lots of money for a family. Secondly, children won't make full use of their school time to study just because they think they will study at home with the tutor. Finally, if parents have their children studying, children will be tired of it.
From the talking above we can draw a condusion[fm1, conclusion], if children really want to study, they will try their best to search for time for studying instead of needing a tutor.
From my point of view, students should make full use of school time to study, and there is no need to employ a private tutor.

It has become a normal phenomena[wd1][np1, usual phenomenon] that many parents hire tutors to teach their children's studies[sn6, children].

Now, let me analysis[fm2, analyze] the advantages and disadvantages about[wd2, of] private tutoring.

On this point, private tutoring is not a good choice.
The opinion on this phenomena varies from person to person. In my opinion, private tutoring is no[wd1, not] necessary. When you are studying at school, you should be more intentive[fm1, attentive],[sw,.] And if you have some problems, just asking your own teacher after class. I believe that your teacher would be more responsible.
Above all, I appeal that parents should not hire tutors if their children have the ability to learn by themselves!

On one hand[wd2, On the one hand], students differ from the abilities to acquire certain knowledges[np1, knowledge] and new subjects. To keep up with others, students of lower learning abilities need to spend more time on their studies, and thus private tutoring is a good choice. With personal directions and tutoring, students can soon find their own way to solver[fm1, solve] certain problems. Based on individual analysis and directions, private tutoring is a good way to help students gain higher grades so as to keep up with others.
However, on the other hand, private tutoring may lead to some disadvantages. The lack of self-reliance and independent-thinking is a typecal[fm1, typical] example. The more tutors teach students, the less students think by their own. Thus, private tutoring has "reared" many students of highly grades and poor abilities. What's worse, private tutoring also makes the competetions[fm1, competition] among students become much more fierce.
From my point of view, I regard private tutoring as a negative way for children's education. Above all, the ability to seek one's own understanding and way to solve new problems is much more important than a simple high grade.

There is no doubt that a good and responsible private teacher can help the children learn more out of school and this may help them make greater progress in their study. From the angle of society, private tutoring provides more job chances.

The payment should be give[wd1][vp4, made] by hour[wd1, on an hourly basis] and the price is usually not so low. In some way, it can make a student lazy. Once they depend on the family teacher[sn6, private tutor], they will not listen to their school teacher carefully. So they waste the time in class. That's so harmful. What's worse, they will become lazy to think by themselves[wd1, become too lazy to think for themselves].
In my opinion, everything has two sides. The important thing is that how[sn2, how] we use the advantages and avoid the disadvantages. Study is a hard thing but there are so many ways to study well. Besides, we should rely on ourselves. If we can learn by ourselves, depend on ourselves, it will be better for our ability, our thought even our life.

Nowadays, it's common for parents to get their children some private tutoring.
Many people hold the opinion that it benefits to [sn2] the students to have private tutoring for the following factors. To begin with, many students don't have enough self-controling [fm1, wd1, self-control], so the private teachers [np2] can urge them to study. Further more, if a student gets troubles in his study, he can get help from the private teacher directly. However, as the old saying goes, every coin owns 2 sides [wd2]. There are also many shortcomings for [wd1, with] private tutoring. For example, many private teachers help the students [np2] with their homework, which may keep the students [np2] from thinking independently. What's more, students may rely on their private teachers too much to get enough knowledge from their school teachers.
It occurs to me that the advantages of private tutoring out weight [fm1, outweighs] its disadvantages. In my opinion, it's up to the private teacher that if he doesn't offer too much extra help [sn6], he will help in developing the self-independence of the students. Moreover, every student is a special one. They differ in interest and ability. While a school teacher cannot afford enough attention to each of his students, a private teacher can do this much better. Last but not least important [wd2], the private teacher may have less generation gap [sn6] with the students [np2], which enathes [fm1, enables] them to offer both studying guide [wd1, guidance] and emtion [wd1, emotional] guide [wd1, guidance].

Surely, private tutoring has advantages that school teaching don't [vp2, doesn't]. a [fm1, A] school teacher has to take all students into consideration. Hence he couldn't understand children's needs entirely. A private tutor has only one student. He can get the measures of the child [sn6] and make out plans accordingly.
However, everything has two side [np1, sides], including private tutoring. Some tutors teach how to work out a question, not knowledge. Some are not competent [wd1, competitive], giving the wrong answer. Some children may be idle, leaving all homework in the hands of tutors.
Therefore, to some extent, private tutoring is harmful.
In my view, parents should contact school teachers to see whether it's necessary to find a tutor. If necessary, what kind of tutor the child needs [sn2]. When hiring a tutor, parents must know the tutor's ability well.

And I am sure if you study more efficiently in school, your scores will certainly be higher. No private tutoring means more spare time for your own interest [sn6].

Obviously, to those who have difficulty in learning, tutors' help benefits a lot. Not only can addition classes higher the scores [sn6], but also they increase students' confidence [sn6], so that students can carry on learning actively. For students who get good grades and are eager for more knowledge, they can get what they need from tutors.
However, tutor lessons are not "the more, the better". They take up students' leisure time. If parents make too much [wd1, many] lessons, students can be tired, and may even hate studying.
In my opinion, getting tutor lessons should be both effective and affordable [sn6]. Students should find their wak [fm1, weak] points before they choose the lessons they need and lessons may well not take too long time [sn6]. Only in this way can students benefit most from tutor teaching.

It's really a good method [sn2] to some students who study very well, it's a waste of time and money! Compared with private tutoring, they [sn4] need rest and some time to think problems more.
As I see it, private tutoring is a good way for students who can't learn very well [sn2, by] theirselves [fm1, themselves], it is also a good job for teachers. So when parents want to give your children a private tutoring [np2], please ask your children [sn6].

Today, the phenomenon of employing private tutors for children is quite general, so I want to say something on that. 
Without any doubt, private tutoring owns its advantages as it can help children comprehense [fm1, comprehend] what they ought to study better. What's more, it can be a kind of addition [sn6] to what children have already known. In other words, it can enlarging [vp3, enlarge] their horizon.
As a saying puts that [sn2] every coin has two sides. On one hand [wd2], private tutoring may be a threat to children's capability of receiving new information to some extent. And it's also dangerous for students to rely on private tutors and ignore the content that teachers conduct in class. On the other hand, parents can hardly identify the quality of tutors, and employing bad tutors maybe just a waste of money. 
In my opinion, parents should choose a better way which adapts to their child. If private tutoring does do good to a student, appearantly [fm1, apparently] this is the better [sn2] means. And I hope children and parents balance the two sides of the coin, and cautiously make the decision.

Among all the issues that individnals [fm1, individuals] are talking about, private tutoring is one of the hottest. Employing private tutoring is very popular among parents because they are feared [sn2] that their children fall behind in study. But does it as good as people expect [sn2]?
A number of persons [wd1, people] hold the opinion that private tutoring is advantagerous [fm1, advantageous]. First of all, it assists students to aquir [fm1, acuire] more knowledge that can't be reached in classes. And then, it'll widen their horizon.

Meanwhile, some citizens are [sn2, in] favor of the opposite view. They think too much tutoring may weaken children's ability of learning [sn2, by] themselves. Students rely too much on private teachers that they will be lazy to think. With the passage of time, it'll show terrible effects [sn6].
Based on the analysis mentioned above, I think appropriate private tutoring is of help. Because it lets students feel more confident and motivate [vp2, motivates] them to learn more quickly.

It has an evident advantage. If we don't do good job in school, a family teacher can help us get master of knowledge [sn6] we miss in class so as to catch up with our classmates.

Besides, they believe private tutoring is absolutely of great benefit for students when they spend most of their time on studying other than playing games or [sn2, doing] something else.

What's more, it provides some job positions [sn6] for those jobless people or [sn2] who want to take a part-time job.

On the one hand, private tutoring can indeed improve children's studying skills and helps [vp3, help] them score high marks [sn6]. Also, your child becomes the target student and all the content of the private class is prepared for him or her. Children can get extra assit [fm1, assistance] besides in normal class of school.

Nowadays [sn2] it is normal to hire a teacher particularly for kids. [sn2] Because every parent in china want [vp2, wants] his or her child to have a better understanding of what they learned in school, and to get higher scores in class.
However [sn2] this phenomenon has both benefits and harm.

In my opinions [wd2, opinipn], I think [sn6] hiring a teacher has more harms than benefits. Studying in school is just enough, [sn1] we should not waste of [sn2] money.

Nowadays, more and more parents find tutors for their children. The phenomenon is very common, from kids in kinderguaten [fm1, kindergarten] to primary students, from junior high students to senior high students, and, to everyone's surprise, even some university students [sn6].
Of course, private tutoring has a lot of advantages. First of all, it can help those who cannot do well in their study to catch up with those good students.

Third, tutors often have patience with those who learn slowly to make sure they actually learn by heart. However, it also has some bad effects.

Private Tutoring[fm1 tutoring] is a choice to help elementany[fm1 elementary], primary or senior high school students to master the knowledge they should learn. Almost all tutors are students studying in college, because of the fact that they have the experience to guide the kids, and help them to pass many examinations.

It seems that more and more parents tend to hire private tutor to help their children with their study nowadays. They might feel happy that they've fulfilled their parental duties. But there exist advantages as well as disadvantages in terms of private tutoring.
On the one hand, a tutor may solve the difficulties and puzzling questions children confront in study in time, which teachers in school can't. Additionally, children have more access to fresh ways of thinking that they fail to get from shool[sw school]. On the other hand, it takes up too much of the little time, children[fm1 children] have after class, as a result of which pressure of learning may grow gradually.

As is shown above, I think the regative[fm1 negative] effects have overwhelmed the positive ones. Children should be given more freetime[fm1 free time], choose[sn2 to choose] what they want to learn. Parents should also bear in mind that they'd better ask for children's opinion before deciding to hire a private tutor.

Tutors help children with problems they meet in study with someone[sn2] to turn to when they come across trouble, they are more enthusiasm[fm2 enthusiastic] and less likely to feel depressed. Moreover they can learn more knowledge, which is the ultimate purpose of parents. 
On the other hand hiring private tutors may bring along with negative effect. Children may probably count on their tutors and don't concentrate their mind to listen to their teachers in class. Undoubtedly it will severely cut down their grades however they are hard-working[however hard they are working] after class. 
In my humble opinion, it is hard to tell whether tutor hiring is doing more good than harm or doing more harm than good[sn6 or not]. What we can decide is that if you have a tutor, you should make good use of it.

In recent years, the phenomenon of private tutoring has been commonly brought into the public's focus. Some parents strongly hold[wd1 support] it, while some teachers worry about this tendency. Anyway, this phenomenon has become popular. 
As the proverb sayings "everything has two sides".[sn2] As to the private tutoring, we also need to measure it in both sides. Supporters think private tutoring is complementary to the study in school. Some students may not understand what they learn and private tutoring will help them to grasp the knowledge completely. And this will promote the grades. What's more, by private tutoring, students can acquitance[fm1][vp5 get acquainted with] a new learning way. But on the contrary, private tutoring has its harmness[fm2 harm]. It will make students more reliable, and listen to the lessons in class not well. Meanwhile, it's harmful for the students to think about problems themselves. So this is what many educators worry about.
In my opinion, I don't support the private tutoring. It's harmful for the learning ability of students. And it is unequal to the students whose family can't affort[fm1 afford] it. Learning is by[wd1 based on] yourself, not the private tutoring. So I think this phenomenon can[wd1 should] stop[vp5 be stopped], if proceed[sn6 If it continues], the learning ability of students will strongly decrease.[sn1]

Now, it is very common for parents to ask for private tutors to teach their children. I think it is a very complex questions[np1 question] to say if it's helpful or harmful.
On the one hand, it certainly has some advantages. Firstly, children can learn the lessons for a second time. So that they can understand what they learned better. Next, they can ask the tutors the questions they can't solve themselves. Also, tutors can tell them some experiences about how to do better in their study.
But also, everything has its two sides. On the other hand, it has many disadvantages as well. For example, children may not listen to class in the school because they can learn it again at home. This situation will be very dangerous in their study. At the same time, they won't do their homework on their own. When they meet some difficulties, they will ask tutors instead of solving it themselves.
So in my opinion, tutoring is not necessary at all. After all, study is a personal thing. They[sw The] only way to study well is thinking more and practicing more, and these are the things tutors can't give us.

Parents always make their efforts to seek for various tutors and arrange their children's holiday time for different kinds of intensive lessons for example[wd1 such as] English calligraphy, painting and so on.
Why does private tutoring become so normal? In my mind, it is intense competition that contributes to this tendency.

Today private tutoring is very popular because people become richer and parents lose[fm1 love] their children so much that they don't want them to fail at the starting line.
Private tutoring is usually effective. It help[vp2 helps] children get higher scores and learning[vp3 learn] something out of class. But as we all know, it has many side effects. Private tutoring is usually very expersive[fm1 expensive] and many ordinary families can't afford it. So it is up fair[fm1 unfair] for those poor families. Private tutoring also takes a lot of time and children may be easily tired. What's worse, it is not good for children to form a habit of independent[fm2 independence].
In my opinion, private tutoring is useful but not necessary. It is reasonable for those who don't do well in their study to ask help from private tutoring. But it is better for than[sw them] to learn by themselves, which is cheaper and more efficient.

Nowadays the competition in exams are more and more serious. As a consequence, private tutoring become[vp2, becomes] commen[fm1, common] and the number of the students who have a private teacher growing[vp4, grows] rapidly.
First of all, I admit that private tutoring has many advantages. Teachers in school serve the whole class. They can't pay undivided attention to every students. Nor can they make themselves suit for every students. So some students may not acquire as much the knowledge as the teacher[np1, teachers] deliver and may lose his interest in study. In this case, having private tutoring can be beneficial. The teacher only serve[vp2 serves] one student, so that student[np2, the student] can choose the method he like[vp2, likes] and ask whenever he doubt[vp2, doubts] and the most important is that he can get full attention.
However, when private tutoring become[vp2, becomes] just a way[wd1, the only way] to improve grades, it really lose[vp2, loses] its meaning. And so it does. Large enough as the schoolwork is, students still have to set aside time for private tutoring, which makes students extremely exhausted. In this condition, I doubt whether private tutoring is still effective.
As far as I'm concerned, before having private tutoring, we should consider our own situation. If I can learn well on my own, the private tutoring is meaningless. Only if the teachers in school don't suit me and I find myself haring difficulty in learning shall we consider to turn to private tutoring for help. And only in this way can private tutoring really benefit you.

With the development of the education system. Private[fm1, private] tutoring has aroused the concern among parents. It is very common for parents to hire a private tutor for their child to make sure that their child can gain a higher score in school.
When it comes to the advantages and disadvantages about the private tutoring. Peoples oppioons[fm1 opinions] very[fm1 vary] from one to another. Some maintain that tutoring can not only ensure the childs[fm2 children] a higher score but also caltivate[fm1 cultivate] their interests of studying and drive them work harder to realize their dreams. However, others argue that the tutoring is nothing but a waste of money, it makes children have less time to enjoy themselves.[sn1] In addition, what the tutor teaches may mislead them.
From my perspective, the private tutoring has more disadvantages than advantages. First of all, it can't meet childs'[fm2 children's] favor[wd1 need] for the most case[np1 cases]. Secondly, the school learning is enough if children have devoted themselves in[wd2 to] it. Last but not the least, the quality of the tutors can't be sure[wd1 guaranteed].

Nowadays, it's very common that parents hire private tutors for their children. Students in high school, middle school, primary school or even kindagartern[fm1 kindergarten] are privately teached[fm2 taught] after school. Many parents never consider their children's willing[fm2][wd1 opinion]. Some parents ask tutors to teach their children more, and the rest[wd1 other] parents do so in fear of their children being left behind. So it's kind of competition between families.
Apparently, private tutors can teach students much. Students can enjoy extra happiness of getting knowledge. Also studnts[fm1 students] can have more individual education because private tutors are always one-to-one. So students who have private tutors are more competitive that their peer[np1 peers].
However students also suffer a lot from private tutors. It's natural that young people like playing. Private tutors take too much time so students are always very unwilling to have their personal education.
As far as I'm concerned, it's not a good way to give students extra education from private tutors. First, it's unfair for the students who's[fm1 whose] family can not afford a teacher. Second the students have enough education in schools, what they really need is just practice.[sn1] Third I think private tutor[np2 a private tutor] may cause students unwilling[vp3 to be unwilling] to study because they would feel study very boring and tiring.
So it's not a grad[fm1 good] way to hire private tutors for students.

Nowadays, it is a very common thing for parents to employ tutors for their children, ranging from primary school students to high school students. There has been a hot debate on the effect private tutoring have[vp2 has] on students.
Many people think that private tutoring benefits students a lot. Private tutors can help students a lot because they can focus on the student's own problem, so that a method more suitable to the student can be developed. And when students have some problems in school, they can turn to their own tutors for help. In addition, the tutors may be more patient and have a good relationship with the student. But there are also some people against private tutoring. They hold the idea that students may be too dependent on the tutors to study hard at school and solve their difficulties on their own. What's more, employing private tutors will add up financial burden for the family.
In my opinion, private tutoring does more good than harm. As long as the student not only turn to their tutors for help when they have difficulties in their studies, but also study hard at school and take good advantage of their school resources, private tutoring will help the students with their students[wd1 study] greatly.

In fact, the private tutoring has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, it is really effective for students to improve their grades.

From my point of view, I think it is really necessary for some students who act poor[sn2 poorly] in their study to accept private tutoring.

Relying on the private tutor is not good for students' long-term development.

In my opinion, when parents prepare to[sn6, are going to] search for tutors for their children, it's necessary for them to ask for children's opinion. To do it after they reach an agreement would be the best choice. Only then can both of them receive the expected results.
In a word, private tutoring is necessary or not, depends on whether the children really need it. So please be advisable[wd1] before you make decisions, parents?

Different people hold different views on private tutoring. Some people consider it as a efficient way to improve student's scores, but some people do not. The private tutoring can help students understood[vp2, understand] the knowledge given by teachers in the classroom fully, and it can help students know how to solve difficult problems. However, sometimes the private tutoring can drive students to be tried[wd2, drive students tired] of their study because of the heavy burden.

As the saying goes, each coin has its two sides. On the one hand, private tutoring can make up for children's weak points[wd1 weakness] to the point[sn6]. Compared with school education, it cares more for self[wd1 individual] problems rather than common ones. Thus,,[sw] it'll help students make progress more easily. On the other hand, it also has disadvantages, it'll take up students' spare time and do[vp2 does] harm to their overall development.[sn1] Children spend more time in study thus[sn2 and thus] lack other activities. In addition, it'll led[vp4 lead] to a bad atmosphere[sn6 common practice] , teachers would receive more money from private tutoring.[sn1] And it's unfair for those who're poor unable[sn2 poor and unable] to invite[wd1 employ] private tutors.
In my opinion, we shouldn't have great passion for private tutoring. If the children really need one, we can invite[wd1 employ] private tutor[np1 tutors] for him[np1 them], otherwise[fm1 Otherwise] we don't have to do it.

Nowadays, it is extremely common for children to have private tutoring or "after-class classes". Given the fierce competition outside the school and the great pressure from tough exams, it is really no strange[wd1 normal]. But what we are concerned about is that whether they are useful or not.
From some parents' and teachers' view, private tutoring is necessary. They always argue that students who want to score high marks or do a much greater job in exams cannot get enough knowledge just in classes at school. And private tutoring can just make up this part. However, at the same time, many other teachers and parents hold the view that it is a bad idea to have private tutoring for many students start to ignore the importance of learning in class and some even rely on the outclass study completely.
In my opinion, it is not good to attach too much attention to private tutoring. After all, class is the most important learning place and most teachers will teach all the knowledge their students need to cope with the examinations. So if not really necessary, private tutoring should not be adopted.

Nowardays[fm1 Nowadays] the phenomenon that[sn2 of] having private tutoring for children is very common. Many parents hope to help their kids study better by[wd2 in] this way. I think private tutoring has it's[fm1 its] advantages and disadvantages.
As for the advantages, first, the teacher who goes to students home just teaches one or two children at a time[wd1]. So he can express his ideas and knowledge more patient[sn2 patiently]. And the students can learn better. What's more, some college students also do tutoring. They have their own ways to study. And sometimes these ways are easier[sn3 make it easier] for kids to learn and understand. But on the other hand, having private tutoring costs a lot of money. Some families in poor condition can't afford it. 
In my opinion, students should study hard at school when they have problems, asking their own teachers is their best choice.[sn1] I don't think private tutoring is a good method. Anyway, school is the right place for us to learn and our own teachers know us better. Having private tutoring may also let children feel lonely and lose the chance to communicate with others.

Recently, it has become a common phenomenon that parents ask a private tutor to help their children in study. With the development of science and technology. Our [fm1, our] living condition improved[vp4 has improved] a lot and the completion[fm1 competition] has become fiercer than ever before, not only among adults, but also children. So it's reasonable for parents to do so. However, is it neccessay[fm1 necessary] for children?
A private tutor can solve the problems a child encounter[vp2 encounters] in time, which help[vp2 helps] him or her hold the interest and keep going for more knowledge. In addition, when the child wants to learn something not related to study but interesting and meaningful for him, the tutor will give him a[np2 an] answer adequately in detail. Besides, they can build a friendship between them.
Everything has two sides and private tutoring is not an exception. For one thing, it tighten[vp2 tightens] children's schedule[sn6] so that[wd1 so] they may have enough[wd1 not enough] time to relax or do other things such as playing basketball. For another, it takes parents some money to employ a tutor, which is a heavy burden especially for the relatively poor family.
It's hard to say whether the tutor does more good than harm as it depends on the situation of the children. If he is poor at study, it would [sn2 would be] a good choice to have a private tutor.

Nowadays, along with the rapid development of the economy, people are putting more emphasize[fm2 emphasis] on their children's education. To improve their academic grades, may parents employ private tutoring[fm2 tutors] to teach their children, which is a common phenomenon today.
As a matter of fact, it has many benefits. For example, since time in class is so limited that the kids may not fully understand what the teachers say, thus having difficulty completing their homework. The private tutorings[fm2 tutors] can help them solve their problems and then check their homework, in which case, students are liable to make greater progress in studies. In addition, in this way, parents can spend less time on their kids' grades and be more concentrated on their work, making them enjoy their own life more.
However, employing a private tutoring also bring[vp2 brings] bad effects.

With the society developing, the competition between people of the same age become more and more cruel, and parents are worried about their children education more than ever before. So a new way to help children with their study exists-that is what we call Private Tutoring, which is quite popular nowadays.
When it comes to the disadvantages and advantages of private tutoring, many parents argue that it is a perfect way to fill[vp1 fill in] the spare time of their kids at weekend, so that they can spend more time on study, not on video games. But there're still quite a few people view[sn2 who view] it as a burden for children, which make [vp2 makes] children inactive and tired.

Nowdays[fm1 Nowadays], it's really common to employ family teacher[np1 teachers] for kids. But, is it a right choice?
There is no doubt that family teachers can develop children's marks[wd1] at school, which is the biggest reason why parents prefer family teachers. If students can't understand their classes clearly at school, family teachers can help a lot. At the same time, family teacher[np2 a family teacher] may test his student and then teach him in his own way. And students[np1 the student] can learn easier by this way[wd2, in this way].
On the other hand, there's[vp2 there are] also many problems about it. Firstly, kids may depend on their family teacher[np1 teachers] too much and they may study less at school. It's really harmful. Students should study hard at school and family teacher[np2 a family teacher] is only supposed to help them[np2 the student] if a student give[vp2 gives] up his school study because he has a family teacher, he won't get good marks, too. [sn1] Moreover, some family teachers are not good at teaching, they only want to earn some money.[sn1] Some family teacher even help[vp2 helps] his student do his homework and cheat parents.
I think every coin has two sides. We should face this problem seriously. No matter[wd1 Whether] you prefer a family teacher or not, remember ask[vp3 to ask] your kid and try to leave him to[wd1 let him] make the decision.

The teacher will have more time and patience to explain why it is so because he has only one student, however, in the other hand, private tutoring has some problems.[sn1] It costs too much to hire a private teacher and cat[fm1 cut] down the lecure[fm1 leisure] time that belongs to the student. Some may not like it because they need relax[fm2 relaxation] at home instead of studying all day.
As far as I am concerned, private tutoring is unnecesary[fm1 unnecessary] given the conditions we have now. when[fm1 When] meeting with difficultives[fm1 difficulties], we have many ways to tackle them, such as asking the teachers, students or searching on the taternet[fm1 internet].

Nowadays it is very common that parents provide a family teacher for their children.
In the society, children have too much pressure, they have many homworks[fm1][np1 homework], the task in the class is also too heavy for them.[sn1] Thus, they study day after day, most of them cannot keep the pace of the teacher, they cannot understand the comments the teachers say[wd2 make].[sn1] Therefore, they should come to another way to finish their study, that is family teaching.
Through family teacher, children can learn more what they cannot learn in class, it can expand their knowledge, and have a good understanding in class[sn2 they have a good understanding in class].[sn1] What's more, you are more free in this way, because you are teached[fm2 taught] by your teacher, only one person so you can save you time and learn more things.
But on the other hand, there are some bad parts. First, children will become more relax[fm2 relaxed] in the class, they cannot get more study in they class, they think they can learn after class and do not listen carefully in the class.[sn1]
I think family teaching is good for children. Because it can make children learn more knowledge. And they can study better!

As education becomes more and more important these days, finding a private teacher for child is more general. My younger brother is only seven years old and he is in elementary school, but his parents find a match[fm1 math] teacher and an English teacher for him. They teach him study once a week. Not just my brother, many kids[wd2 but also many other kids] in his class have their own private teachers. This phenomenon is more general in higher grades[np1 grade].
Is private tutoring good or bad? In one hand[wd1 On the one hand], private teacher[np2 a private teacher] can help students with what they didn't understand in the class and help them with their homework. this[fm1 This] will certainly promote their study. But on the other hand, with the help of other people, students lose the opportunity to think by themselves. They just recive[fm1 receive] the knowledge and repeat them. It's not good for students to develop their ability for independent study. Private tutoring also costs much. It will make family fannacial[fm1 financial] pressure heavier.
In my opinion, if not necessary, don't find a private teacher for children. Although it has some advantages, giving children more spare time and making them learn by themselves are better.

The growth of students who have study problems makes it popular for private tutoring.[sn6] More and more parents tend to ask private tutors for their children[wd1 employ private tutors for their children].
However, every coin has two sides. On the one hand, private tutors help children solve their study problems. And a face-to-face teaching makes it easier to understand their lessons for children. Besides, children can spend more time on their sickness[wd1 weakness] so that they can make balanced progress. On the other hand, private tutoring may cause children to rely on their tutor[np1 tutors]. They ask tutors every problems they encounter instead of using their own minds. They may lose the ability to think independently.
Personal speaking, I'm against private tutoring. I thouk[fm1 think] children should learn to rely on themselves, so that they can view the world as an individual, a useful and independent individual. I want to say, self-reliance is the most important thing a child should master.

It is very common for parents to seek private tutors for their children in current time. Parents worry that their children will fall behind in the more and more competitive society. In their eyes, working hard is the access to a bright future.
The advantage of private tutoring is obvious. One tutor help[vp2 helps] one child to study and it can make the child have a better understanding of his course. However, this can also give more pressure to children.

So in my mind, I prefer not to have private tutoring. Because it's only a waste of money.

But there are some bad effects that we can't neglect.

In addition, private tutors always have lessons on weekends, it makes children very tired, they don't have much time to relax and play, so this way will only do a litde[fm1][wd1] for their study progress.[sn1]
From my point of view, private tutoring is helpful to some extent. The key point is: don't let it fulfill[wd1 fill] all your children's leisure time. And let your children choose it freely, don't try to order them to.[sn1]

We can understand that parents hope that their children can master knowledge as much as better[wd2 as much as possible], so they may have better lives in the future. But, are the tutors good for children's study?
Some people believe it is true. They think children need guides, because they can't study by themselves. Not like teachers in the school, private tutors only teach one person. There is also a[np2 an] important reason why they think tutor[wd1 tutoring] is good, it is that the classroom is their home.[sn1] So they can watch their kids learning. According to these, they are sure that tutor[wd1 tutoring] can make their kids study better.
But some people think there is one point that they ignored[vp5 ignore]. Although tutor[np2 a tutor] can teach children more knowledge, but this can also decrease children's ability of thinking by themselves. Children must pay attention to teacher[np2 the teachers] at school so they can't think at daytime[sn6]. If they have to listen to what the tutor teach[vp2 teaches] at night, they won't have any time to think by themselves. In this way, children will be a bin[wd1] that used to[wd1 is used to] absorb knowledge, but can't think. That's terrible for a purson[fm1 person], especially for his character's forming.
As for my opinion, I dislike the tutor. I think the knowledge from teachers in school is enough. Children should think of the knowledge at their spart[fm1 spare] time. Even if they have other time after they finish their study, they should relax or communicate with their friends. I think these activities are better for children's future.

In some ways, private tutoring can help students' study. Students may not understand what their teachers say in class. Then they can get help from private tutoring. What's more, some good students can learn more about their study. Through this way, their grades can be great.
Every coin has two sides. There are some bad things about private tutoring. Students may depend on it, then they may not listen to the teacher carefully in class. Besides, the quality of private tutoring can't be guaranteed.
From my point of view, private tutoring is unnecessary. The knowledge we learn from school is enough. We don't have to learn more outside class. We should focus our attention on our class, then we can get great grades.

Nowadays, it is very common to affor[fm1][wd1 employ] a private teacher for childs[fm2 children]. The habit of parents gradually spreads as the household incomes keep rising. Most parents have the ability. Then comes the problem[sn5 the problem comes], is it a good way to help the childs[fm2 children]?
Some hold the opinion that a tutor can greatly help childs[fm2 children] with the subjects. For instance, the work of dealing with some hard problems, summarize[sn2] the work of dealing with some hard problems, summarize[sn2] the knowledge, and so on.[sn2] Tutors are needed, especially for the childs[fm2 children] who don't have a good habit to study[wd2 of studying]. And, tutors help with some philosophy problems. Some children may lose heart in studying, fall deep in[wd1 get indulge in] somputer[fm1 computer] games. They really need to communicate because tutors can be good friends.
Others don't think so. A tutor can take the schedule into totally mess for they take up too much time that can be used by the child personally originally. And, a tutor doesn't often care about the child's creativity and imaginity[fm2 imagination], for he focus[vp2 focuses] on how much the child knows, how high the child can get in a exam.
In my opinion, whether a child needs a private tutor depends on what kind of student he is. If he knows the importante of acquiring knowledges and have the ability to understand what he is learning, it is not nessesary to afford[wd1 employ] a private tutor at all. But if he doesn't, I personally think a tutor is needed. Above all, a tutor[wd1 whether to employ a tutor] depends on whether you need him or not.

Private tutoring has some advantages. Firstly, it helps students make progress in learning. A private teacher cam provide them with extra knowledge and good experience which are not acquired in classroom. Secondly, some college students can earn some money to live a easier life by offering private tutoring. Thirdly, private tutoring provides working chance[sn6 jobs], which relieves the employment stress in society.
On the other hand, it has some disadvantages. With private teachers helping, students wouldn't think by themselves. Meanwhile, private tutoring strengthens the turdon[fm1 burden] of some families, because they have to pay for it. Morever[fm1 Moreover], private tutoring decrease[vp2][wd1 reduces] the spare time of students and they can't do what they want to do.
In my opinion, whether employ[sn2 to employ] private tutors is determined basied[fm1] on[wd1 according to] personal conditions. If you want to enter a key[wd1 top] university and your study is not good, you should employ a private tutor.

Nowadays, the phenomenon is very common that many parents find[wd1 employ] private tutors for their children, for these or those[sn6] reasons, And I'd like to take about the advantages and disadvantages of the private tutoring.
It's obvious that there are many advantages of private tutoring. Firstly, it can let the children spend more time styding[fm1 studying] instead of just playing for fun. Then, the private tutoring can help the children understand what they can't in the class during the daytime, and the children may gain from it.
On the other hand, the private tutoring has some disadvantages. As we all know, children have their own intents[fm1 interest], and the interests[np1 interest] may give way to the private tutoring and can't get developed. What's more, the children can't hear[fm1 bear] the heavy press[fm2 pressure] of study, it's unhealthy for them to learn all day round.[sn1]
Personally speaking, private tutoring has more advantages than disadvantages. We can find tutors for children, but we should pay attention to how much time it will take up. The times[np1 time] of classes every week should be suitable, and we should make sure that the children can gain something from it. So how to use the private tutoring is the only thing we have to care about.

Recently, many parents prefer to invirting[fm1][wd1 employing] private tutors for their children. Why does the situation appear so widely[sn6 is the phenomenon so popular]?
Private tutoring is a new career which is developing at an unbelievable speed. The college students are the main members of the private tutors. They get the pay from the job to support their study and practice themselves. Meanwhile, children may improve fast with the tutor's help. It seems helpful both for the tutors and the children. But in fact, it's not as useful as the parents imagine[wd1 hope]. Children are tired enough, but the private tutoring makes them move[sw more] stressful. Futhermore[fm1 Furthermore], it decrease[vp2 decreases] the independence and confidence of the children.
In my view, the private tutor may be helpful but not necessary. If your children can study by themselves, why do you spend extra money inviting[wd1 employing] the tutors?

Nowadays private tutoring is becoming a common phenomenon in our society. The groups who ask for private tutoring rang[fm1 range] from primary school to high school students and the subjects which you can ask for a private tutoring[sn6] consist of all subjects you can learn in and out[wd2 out of] school. It seems that private tutoring is very popular.
Though more and more parents are willing [wd2 willing to] ask for private tutoring for their children, we should learn about both the advantages and disadvantages of private tutoring. The advantages of private tutoring is obvious, firstly, it can help the children study better,[sn1] sometimes the teachers in school teach too fast as your child can't catch up with the teacher, the a private teacher will be of great help.[sn1] According to the child's own study problems, the private teacher can teach the child what is the most necessary. On the other hand, quit[fm1 quite] a lot of the private teachers are college students whose family[np1 families] are poor, a part-time private tutoring job can help them earn extra money to supply[wd2 support] college life.
Every coin has two sides, so as the private tutoring, it still has some disadvantages, such as it makes the child think less by his own[wd2 on his own] and the cost is high.[sn1]
In my opinion, parents should learn about their children's study performances firstly and then decide whether their children really need a private tutoring[fm2 tutor]. Even so, do not ask private turtoring for all subjects[sn6] in order to make the child think and study independent[sn2 independently].
