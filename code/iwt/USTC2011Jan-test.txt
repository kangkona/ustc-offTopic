The phenomena of hire[vp3, hiring] a private tutor for kids is very common at present. Is it good or bad? It's hard to say.
Some may think private tutoring gives children a more flexible learning environment. When they encounter difficult problems at home, they can ask it in time and solve it at once. On the other hand, it provides many colleage[fm1, college] students with practicing opportunities, which can also help them make money to afford their own life[wd2, expenses]. However, some may argue it will make kids lazier in thought. Once he come[vp2, comes] across a problem, he asks[vp4, will ask] the tutor. That's to say, he doesn't think by[wd2, for] himself. What's more, it will add more burden to the family financial, especially if the family is not that rich.
As far as I can see, it is not good to hire a private tutor. Instead, we can encourage kids to bring their friends together home,[wd1, home] and study. They can discuss problems together, which will help them more. What's more, teachers are good resources, why don't make full use of them? (A small joke). But it's true, we should discuss with the teacher more.

Nowadays, it is becoming more and more popular for parents to hire private tutors to teach their kids . I think that this is a both-edged sword[wd1, two-edged sword] to the development of kids.
Firstly, it has some advantages. Private tutors can help kids to improve their grades. Besides, children have more time to communicate with their teachers and learn something that they can't learn during class. What's more, it can make fully[fm2, full] use of children's time so that they won't be lost in computer games.
On the contrary, however, there are some disadvantages about private tutoring. At first, it will make children have no time to develop their own habbits[fm1, habits]. Further more, children may well get bored with what he is learning and even develop an emotion of aversion. The worse result may be a generation gap between parents and children.
So, in my opinion, parents had better not hire private tutors to teach their children. Don't make them lost[vp3, lose] interest in study, or it will be a tragedy.

In the modern society, as more and more attention is attached to education, private tutoring has become a common scene around us. Many parents, no matter rich or poor, invest a lot to seek private guidance in the consideration that their children can have a better future.
Then a question arises, is it a good thing to have private tutoring? Views on this question vary from person to person. Some think that it's a right and good thing to have private tutoring, given that it brings a lot of benefits to those students who may otherwise fall behind and[sn1, behind. And] what's more, private tutoring can concentrate more on the students' own conditions which will do a lot of good to their studies and development. While others argue. That[sn2, , that] it's unfair to have private tutoring, because many poor families can't afford to do so and this would only bring a broader gap between the rich and poor. And what's more, children need their own spare time to do what they like rather than study after study.
In my opinion, the strength of private tutoring outweigh the drawbacks. As everyone of us is unique, we need private tutoring to give us unique guidance which will definitely make our study easier and of course, happier.

Nowadays, as the competetions[fm1, competition] in education have[vp2, has] become more and more fierce, private tutoring becomes a common phenomenon. What is the effect of private tutoring on students, good or bad? The answer may not be concluded as[wd1, in] a simple word.
On one hand[wd2, On the one hand], students differ from the abilities to acquire certain knowledges[np1, knowledge] and new subjects. To keep up with others, students of lower learning abilities need to spend more time on their studies, and thus private tutoring is a good choice. With personal directions and tutoring, students can soon find their own way to solve certain problems. Based on individual analysis and directions, private tutoring is a good way to help students gain higher grades so as to keep up with others.
However, on the other hand, private tutoring may lead to some disadvantages. The lack of self-reliance and independent-thinking is a typecal[fm1, typical] example. The more tutors teach students, the less students think by their own. Thus, private tutoring has "reared" many students of highly grades and poor abilities. What's worse, private tutoring also makes the competetions[fm1, competition] among students become much more fierce.
From my point of view, I regard private tutoring as a negative way for children's education. Above all, the ability to seek one's own understanding and way to solve new problems is much more important than a simple high grade.

Nowadays, it is a very common thing for parents to employ tutors for their children, ranging from primary school students to high school students. There has been a hot debate on the effect private tutoring have[vp2 has] on students.
Many people think that private tutoring benefits students a lot. Private tutors can help students a lot because they can focus on the student's own problem, so that a method more suitable to the student can be developed. And when students have some problems in school, they can turn to their own tutors for help. In addition, the tutors may be more patient and have a good relationship with the student. But there are also some people against private tutoring. They hold the idea that students may be too dependent on the tutors to study hard at school and solve their difficulties on their own. What's more, employing private tutors will add up financial burden for the family.
In my opinion, private tutoring does more good than harm. As long as the student not only turn to their tutors for help when they have difficulties in their studies, but also study hard at school and take good advantage of their school resources, private tutoring will help the students with their students[wd1 study] greatly.

Nowadays, it's common to see parents hire several tutors for their children. Numerous kids have private tutors through both grade and high school.
It's obvious to see the advantages. First, a tutor can solve your problems immediately, this is of more importance for children who are too shy to consult their teachers[sn1 which is]. Second, a tutor is only for you, which results in more suitable and useful education. Finally, a tutor's interest in one subject might have an influence on you.
However, there are also some disadvantages. First of all, a student with a tutor may be more liable not to solve a question on his own. What's more, private tutoring can bring about financial burden, and sometimes it can be a waste of time if the tutor you hire is not so professional.
In my opinion, you should depend on yourself and try not to hire a tutor unless it's necessary.

People can't reach an agreement on this problem [wd1, issue]. Some people hold the view that private tutoring is good for children's development. For it can contribute to kids' knowledge and their kids can be the top students as well. But there are also some people who are opposite to that view.

Hiring a tutor can be an effective way to help your kid with their grades, on condition that he or she does want to be tutored.

Competitions being so severe among students, parents undoubtedly want their own kids to learn more and better. So they choose tutors to serve their purpose.
Every coin has two sides. On one hand, student can solve problems, learn more useful things with the help of their tutors. On the other hand, while they benefit the teachings of the tutors, students are losing the capability of self-learning, namely, to study on their own.[sw] gradually.
From my point of view, as regards to studying, we students should rely on ourselves and learn independently. Then the tutors won't be that necessary. Thus, with the help of our tutors, we can perform better on our own.

Nowadays, along with the rapid development of the economy, people are putting more emphasize[fm2 emphasis] on their children's education. To improve their academic grades, may parents employ private tutoring[fm2 tutors] to teach their children, which is a common phenomenon today.
As a matter of fact, it has many benefits.

The private tutorings[fm2 tutors] can help them solve their problems and then check their homework, in which case, students are liable to make greater progress in studies.

On the contrary, excess private tutoring may well occupy too much children's spare time and make them too depressed. It is very dangerous.

Nowadays, it's my common for parents to employ private teachers for the children in the hope that their children are better educated.
It is true that private tutoring has its advantages. A private teacher could help children review their classwork. So children can heep[fm1 keep] more knowledge in mind. And when children have questions, it's convenient for them to turn to a private teacher. But just like a coin has two sides, private tutoring also has disadvantages. First, it contribute[vp2 contributes] to the laziness of the children. Many children don't want the private teacher to help them but to finish the work instead of themselves[sn6]. So having a private teacher is a way for them to escape from thinking for the solution of a problem. Second, many private teachers don't teach children in the right way. They just solve a problem for children, but don't drive home why the problem could be solved in a part color[fm1 particular] way. So, children learn nothing more than just a question[sn6 a solution to a question].
In my opinion, private tutoring is no more than just employing a person watching your chlrdren[sw children] doing homework. it's really a wast[fm1 waste] of money. Children can study well enough in school, if they pay enough attention on class. Reliance on private teacher lead children pay[vp3 to pay] less attention on[wd2 in] class with the idea that there always be[sn2 is] sameone[sw someone] tp[sw to] help them after class.

On one hand[wd2 On the one hand], private tutoring is good. It's convenient for students to have class at home.

On the other hand, private tutoring has its shortcomings. Parents have to work hard to pay the private teachers, because of the expensive fee. Students may not listen carefully in class, thinking they can study again at home. They have less sleeping time because they study late into night[wd2 at night].

As [wd1, With] the development of social economy, it is increasingly seen [sn6] that many parents pay a considerable number of money to hire [sn2, on hiring] private teachers for their children.
At the first sight, it appears so good that children would receive more excellent education. However, in my opinion, private tutoring is a double-edge sword. On one hand [wd2, On the on hand], despite the money to pay for the teachers [sn6], children would be more lazy when they are in the school because some of them hold the opinion that there is a 'mighty' [fm1, "mighty"] teacher at home to solve everything.

On the other hand, of course, private teachers may have a positive influence on children, and necessary [sn2], a teacher at home is helpful to solve a difficult problem, thus making kids gain progress.
As far as I can see, private tutoring results from the fact that many parents without complete edution [sn2] when they were young and they want to fulfill their dreams on their kids [sn6]. Never the less [fm1, Nevertheless], I am firmly convinced that private tutoring should not be laid beyond the schooling education. It is mainly due to the importance of schooling education that is improved by numerous generations. In this way, we can expect too much about the benefits of private tutoring. It is just one form of supplement to schooling education. There are lots of examples to illustrate this point, such as Emerison and Betran Russel, who both had a compelete [fm1, complete] education at school without private tutoring.
To sum up, private tutoring may do good things [sn6]. However, if we take the cultivation of independent thinking of kids [sn2, into consideration], it should be placed in the right position. Thus, when talking about private tutoring, we regard it only as one kind of supplement forms [sn6] to our schooling education.

As we all know, more and more parents are lieable[fm1, liable] to invite private tutors to help their children study. There are different opinions on this phenomenon as well.
Some of people may think that private tutoring is a good way to help students make great progress in study, because tutors can teach the students how to study and lead the students to study more easily. While this is as well as anything else,[sn6] there are also many people who opposite[fm2, oppose] private tutoring. In their opinion[np1, opinions], study is a thing[sn6] that students must find a way that belongs to themselves. Students should pay more attention to how to learn effectively other than[wd1, rather than] to follow others' way. Only in this way, can students improve their capacity of study[fm2, studying].

I also have something to say on this phenomenon. I hold the opinion that students don't have to follow private tutor's learning method. We can and must develop a good habit of study independently. As is known to many people, education is a way to help children have a good knowledge of the world arould[fm1, around] us. And this means that we should be independent so that we can make ourselves apply to[wd1, adapted to] the society more rapidly.

In my opinion, private tutoring is not so necessary. Some students that have been behind in study [sn6] or wanted [vp4, want] to study better may as well have a private tutor, but for most of us, our nomal [fm1, normal] study is enough and we may not have one [sn2, tutor] to waste our time.

However, most tutors only teach the knowledge in the books, and the methods to face[wd1, deal with] exams. In such case, children will lack the ability to solve problems by themselves.

Now, it is quite normal to give[wd1, find] child[np2, children] a tutor[np1, tutors]. 
Firstly, it has some advantages of course. For example, tutors will teach children patiently so that the children may improve their grades. Besides, tutors will also give them some other knowledge to enlarge their eyesight[sn6, horizon].
However, it also has some disadvantages. As we all known[vp3, know], nowdays[fm1, nowadays], the students'[fm1, students] have many tasks, they[sn1,.

Having private tutors means that they lost[vp4, lose] their free time and have to do more. So they may be very bored and tired, even don't want to study any more.
So, as I see it.[sn1, ,] I think having private tutor is not necessary. If your child want[vp2, wants] to study, he can still study hard on the weekends or the holiday without tutor[np2, a tutor]. When they are tired, they can also have a relax[fm2, relaxation]. I think this may be better.

As for many parents whose children don't do well in their study, private tutoring is the first maybe the only thing they can think of.
Obviously, private tutoring has some advantages. Because of its special way to teach students, it can help children to listen to the teachers more efficiently. And the teacher would be more concertrated[fm1, concentrated] on his/her only students, too. Extra exercises will also have effect on student's progress.

Nowadays it is very common that parents provide a family teacher for their children.
In the society, children have too much pressure, they have many homworks[fm1][np1 homework], the task in the class is also too heavy for them.[sn1] Thus, they study day after day, most of them cannot keep the pace of the teacher, they cannot understand the comments the teachers say[wd2 make].[sn1] Therefore, they should come to another way to finish their study, that is family teaching.
Through family teacher, children can learn more what they cannot learn in class, it can expand their knowledge, and have a good understanding in class[sn2 they have a good understanding in class].[sn1] What's more, you are more free in this way, because you are teached[fm2 taught] by your teacher, only one person so you can save you time and learn more things.
But on the other hand, there are some bad parts. First, children will become more relax[fm2 relaxed] in the class, they cannot get more study in they class, they think they can learn after class and do not listen carefully in the class.[sn1]

Nowdays[fm1 Nowadays], it's really common to employ family teacher[np1 teachers] for kids. But, is it a right choice?
There is no doubt that family teachers can develop children's marks[wd1] at school, which is the biggest reason why parents prefer family teachers.

At the same time, family teacher[np2 a family teacher] may test his student and then teach him in his own way. And students[np1 the student] can learn easier by this way[in this way].
On the other hand, there's[vp2 there are] also many problems about it. Firstly, kids may depend on their family teacher[np1 teachers] too much and they may study less at school. It's really harmful. Students should study hard at school and family teacher[np2 a family teacher] is only supposed to help them[np2 the student] if a student give[vp2 gives] up his school study because he has a family teacher, he won't get good marks, too. [sn1] Moreover, some family teachers are not good at teaching, they only want to earn some money.[sn1] Some family teacher even help[vp2 helps] his student do his homework and cheat parents.
I think every coin has two sides. We should face this problem seriously. No matter[wd1 Whether] you prefer a family teacher or not, remember ask[vp3 to ask] your kid and try to leave him to[wd1 let him] make the decision.

There are many parents like to pay for private tutoring now.[sn2] In the university, there are always many advertisements on the walls which is[vp2, are] looking for a teacher to teach student one by one at home.
The private tutoring can provide a good teaching environment because nothing can interrupt the class. The teacher and the student can communicating[vp3, communicate] deeply and student could ask as much as he or she wants. So private tutoring is a good way to improve students[wd1, students' study], and it takes extra time of the student.[sn1] Many students do not like it.
I think that private tutoring benefits the students and the teachers, and the government should do something to improve the private tutoring.

It is universally acknowledged that house-teaching[sn6, private tutoring] is becoming more and more ordinary. I can't help doubting that if[sn2] the education quality is falling down with developing[fm2, the development of] information and technology.
Generally speaking, on the beneficial hand[sn6, on the one hand], it is ture[fm1, true] that house-teaching[sn6, private tutoring] makes great contributions on[wd2, to] children's study. And it not only helps them make all the problems clear[sn6, better understand the problems], but also provides a partner in loning study[sn6], which gives the children encouragement to explore. But on the opposite hand[sn6, on the other hand], once the house-teacher[sn6, private tutor] is employed, the chirdren[fm1, children] depend most[fm2, mostly] on them[np1, him/her], instead of thinking by themselves[wd2, think for themselves]. The result of children on all kinds of areas[sn2][sn6].
As far as I am concerned, above all it is necessary to bring up the ability to think a problem by oneself[sn6, think for oneself]. This is the basis to work out all the problems. However, I can not doubt [sn6, it goes without saying] that some students do need a partner to study with them[vp2, study with], which is accepted in the modern education system.
In a word, creativity is first to be considerate[sn6]. Everything can be provided to make one people[wd1, person] ideal. House-teaching[sn6, private tutoring] is not exceptional.

As modern life develops education plays a more and more important role in social life. And now , private tutoring is more popular than ever.
Children, especially the school children are let[wd1, expected] to accept [wd1, acquire] better[wd1, more] knowledge. Their parents try everything to help the children better educated. To do these, they go for the private tutor teachers[wd1, private tutors]. Some even won't ask for the children's idea. I think this private tutoring won't help but might led[fm1, lead] to a bad result. Just like.

Now, it's popular among the children to have their own tutors in current society. In my view private tutoring has its advantages and disadvantages.
The most important advantage is that children can get more in for mation[sw information] about exam[np2, the exam] by[wd2, from] their tutors that they can't get in class. And they may feel more relaxed when taught by their private tutors. To this point[sn6] more and more children prefer to choose tutors rather than teachers in class.
However, every coin has two sides, it disadvantages shouldn't be heglect[sw, vp5, neglected].[sn1] If more and more children choose tutor[fm2, tutoring], how the school to exist[sn2][sn6]? Why teachers can not became[vp4, become] tutors? [sn5] Futhermore[fm1, furthermore], some students may be poor so that[wd1, so poor that ] they can't have tutors, in other words, education may become unfair.[sn1] I think even the whole society can not tolerant[fm2, tolerate] this phenomenan[fm1, phenomenon].
Finally, personally speaking, I suggest we must[wd1, should] have tutors in a certain degree[wd2, to a certain degree] own[fm1, our] government should contrl[fm1, control] on this phenomenan[fm1, phenomenon]. [sn1]

In china[fm1, China], a home teacher[wd1, private tutoring] is very popular. I think the reason is the parents and students in china.[sn2] Put the opportunity of entering college a very very important and unhealthy position.[sn2][sn6] Many of them think going to school is the only way to success[sn2, succeed]. So, it make[vp2, makes] the matter that inventing home teacher in china is very popular.[sn2]
Let's Talk[fm1, talk] about it at two sides.[sn6] First, it has its advantage. Such as most of the home teacher are college studeas[fm1, students],[sn2] this can help them make money to decries[fm1, decrease][] the press[wd1, pressure] of there parents. And it has its disadvantage, too. For example, to the student's parents, home teachers' case[fm1, cost] is not cheap, and sometimes, it doesn't work, the home teacher cannot give the student a better understanding about the study but only to help how do their homework.[sn1] so[fm1], by seeing at this side[sn6], home teachers also have their disadvantages.
At last, I want to talk with the student, I think we don't invent[fm1, invite] the home teacher better.[sn6] And do study by yourself. If so, you can make your study ability better and save your parents money. Shouldn't it better?[sn2]
